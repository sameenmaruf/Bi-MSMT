<en> Madam President , off the subject of aeroplane delays , I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Caroline Lucas , who is a British Member .
<en> She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow .
<en> Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent , she was still held in custody all day .
<en> I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology .
<en> I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague , Mrs Hautala .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Lannoye .
<en> I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report .
<2en> I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .
<2en> I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL .
<2en> We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made : Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane .
<en> I have a lot of sympathy with that protest .
<en> I have , however , no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity .
<en> I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane .
<en> I did not hide behind any immunity .
<en> I took the punishment that came to me .
<en> Mrs Lucas should do the same .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow .
<2en> In fact , this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee , and , given that it is a major Commission proposal , which refers to the agreements we reached last year , I consider it admissible .
<2en> We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups , so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The Commissioner will be interested to know that I had the honour of chairing a meeting last week on the issue of child pornography , organised by the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children .
<en> We had an excellent presentation from the officer from Europol , Mr Morgan , and I also had the pleasure of announcing the agreement that I think had just been published in the papers that day .
<en> But I would like to ask how you think extradition requests will work when , for instance , material originates in third countries , where perhaps the same kind of basic legislation does not exist ?
<en> Secondly , what should be our approach to this kind of material arriving from outside the Community ?
<en> This is clearly going to be the route taken in future to circumvent legislation both here and in the United States .
<sp>
<en> There are specific provisions in these proposals to deal with the problem of paedophilia on line on the Internet .
<en> We need to guarantee that judicial cooperation , above all mutual legal assistance with third countries , takes into consideration the need to consolidate the evidence needed for adequate criminal prosecution .
<en> We can only seize the material at the last station in the territory of the Member States .
<en> For instance , in the case of material that comes from third countries , we need to use the common cooperation agreements on mutual legal assistance to request the authorities of those Member States to act against those who produce such material .
<en> I would like to add also that , in this general framework , we must make the best possible use of the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime throughout the Internet .
<en> It is quite clear that producing illicit material concerning paedophile pornography is a criminal activity .
<en> Therefore , the Council of Europe convention would be fully applicable .
<sp>
<en> Question No 44 by Ioannis Marinos ( H-0664 / 02 ) :
<en> Subject : Designation of terrorists as ' political prisoners '
<en> Following the recent arrest of terrorists in Greece , most of those arrested have admitted belonging to the terrorist organisation ' November 17 ' .
<en> However , over the last few days the Greek press has reported - on the basis of information from the above persons or their lawyers - that ' some of them intend to alter their confessions with the aim of securing their release in 10-12 years ' time 'and have invoked the status of ' political prisoner ' on the basis of ' similar instances in other European countries ' , as press publications and TV analyses have reported .
<en> Is the Commission aware of the existence of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union , given that after the recent changes in Community legislation terrorists face tougher treatment , even if it is assumed that the murders and robberies they commit are inspired by ' noble ' ideological motives ?
<sp>
<en> The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty , democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law , principles which are common to the Member States .
<en> They have been recognised by Article 6 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<en> The Commission is therefore unaware of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union , since the mere notion of political prisoners , that is , people who have been in prison or prosecuted only for political reasons or opinions , would be against those founding principles of the Union .
<en> As regards extradition between Member States , therefore , mutual confidence in the national judicial systems has resulted in revision of the political offence derogation in relation to terrorist crimes .
<en> Article 5 ( 1 ) of the 1996 Convention relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union , which supplements the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 thus states : ' For the purposes of applying this Convention , no offence may be regarded by the requested Member State as a political offence , as an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives . '
<en> This statement covers the terrorist offences referred to in the first and second articles of the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism , to which all Member States of the Union are party .
<en> The Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant , which will soon replace the previous extradition system , includes terrorism among the offences that will give rise to surrender , pursuant to a European arrest warrant , provided the offence is punishable in the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or detention order for a maximum period of at least three years .
<en> The political nature of the offence cannot be put forward as grounds for non-execution .
<en> Finally , the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism establishes a common definition of terrorist offences .
<en> It lists serious crimes deemed to be terrorist offences , when committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population and unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act , or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political , constitutional , economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation .
<en> In this definition , reference to ideological motives is therefore irrelevant , both for defining a terrorist offence or avoiding considering it as such .
<sp>
<2en> Thank you , Commissioner .
<2en> I shall inform my honourable friend , who is unable to be here today to discuss this with you , that there can be no remission of sin for any crime committed , as he points out , on the grounds of ideological motive .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I am very grateful , Mr President , but I believe the Commissioner should tell us what the truth is : is it what he stated in his answer to Question No 26 - which is that the regulations are in force - or what he has just stated , which is that the regulations are no longer in force ?
<2en> The Commissioner must clarify the situation and say which is true : his previous statement or the one he has just made .
<sp>
<2en> ( DE ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to reply to Mr Hudghton 's question on the regional advisory councils .
<2en> The question whether it is meaningful and necessary , or regarded as necessary , to consult such a body must arise from the given situation .
<2en> What I drew attention to is this : the basic regulation provides for the option of consulting the advisory councils , and it is therefore not possible to transform this into obligatory consultation in a secondary provision .
<2en> However , I can solemnly pledge , on the Commission 's behalf , that we will always consult the relevant advisory council , if one exists , as a matter of course where there is a regional aspect to a proposal on a region of the sea .
<2en> After all , we ourselves have an interest in obtaining the greatest possible range of clear and detailed information on the meaningful deployment of technical measures .
<2en> As regards Mr Casaca 's comments : yes , of course , what was said in the answer to the question continues to apply .
<2en> However , you do need to consider one thing : you said that the provision of the Accession Treaty automatically continues in force .
<2en> Perhaps this was not translated quite correctly .
<2en> This certainly cannot apply , as this provision of the Accession Treaty , as is well known , has already expired .
<2en> Currently , the situation is this , to be precise : according to the Commission 's Legal Service , the legal basis has expired , but legislation is required to repeal the relevant provision of the regulation as well .
<2en> It does not become invalid of its own accord .
<2en> However , there is a view in the Council 's Legal Service that due to the expiry of the legal basis , this provision of the regulation also forfeits its legal force .
<2en> There are therefore two conflicting legal opinions here .
<2en> As would seem logical , I informed you about the Commission 's legal opinion in my reply .
<sp>
<en> Thank you Commissioner .
<en> The joint debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow , Wednesday , at 12 noon .
<sp>
<en> We support the rapporteur 's proposal to reject the initiative .
<en> However , we do this for very different reasons .
<en> We believe that expulsions and deportations from Member States are wrong .
<en> They do not take account of the underlying reasons forcing people to flee from their countries and often involve sending people to countries where murder , torture and inhuman treatment are not just a threat but bitter reality .
<en> It is also no secret that , again and again , people being deported die because of the actions of security staff .
<en> Expulsions and deportations from Member States are often cruel , inhumane and unjust .
<en> Apart from this , asylum procedures in the EU are often grossly unjust and arbitrary , leading to dramatically varying recognition rates between Member States .
<en> In such a situation , and as long as the global misery of capitalist exploitation , war and violent conflict and disrespect for human rights continue , nobody should be deported from Europe , and there should be no mutual recognition of deportation orders .
<en> In view of all this , we demand a total halt to deportations , the immediate release of all people being detained pending deportation and a permanent right of residence for all undocumented immigrants .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> . – I voted in favour of the rapporteur ’ s opinion , which mirrors that of the specialised parliamentary committee , thereby ensuring that the Commission proposal was rejected .
<2en> I believe that this proposal , which the Commission justifies by saying that the environment must be respected and that unfair competition in the internal market must be combated , leaves much to be desired in terms of its effectiveness and could have damaging repercussions for the current and particularly for the new Member States .
<2en> We must look more closely at the idea of establishing two categories of tax on petrol and at the guarantee that the tax applicable to private vehicles – fuel for non-commercial purposes – will also be rapidly applied to the tax on unleaded petrol in order to take account of the repercussions that these measures will have for the industrial sectors in question .
<2en> Whilst I am aware that there are cases of ‘ gasoline tourism ’ , I believe that the scale of this problem does not justify total harmonisation .
<2en> Tax competition could even be beneficial , since standardisation would , in most cases , lead to higher excise duties .
<2en> I come from one of the Union ’ s outermost Member States , and so I can only hope that geography is taken into consideration in future proposals .
<2en> Portuguese truckers are actually unlikely to become involved in ‘ gasoline tourism ’ in the same way that German or Belgian truckers allegedly are .
<sp>
<2en> – We are in favour of developing research and thus of funding it .
<2en> Of all the European institutions ’ expenditure , it is certainly not expenditure on research and development that bothers us , provided that it does not serve solely as a pretext for subsidising private companies .
<2en> We note , however , that it is research funding , along with social expenditure , that is most readily cut , at least in France , so as to increase aids and subsidies to big business .
<2en> It remains the case that the entire approach adopted in this report is to see research purely as a factor in competition between Europe and the United States or between different companies .
<2en> In fact , the report itself is obliged to note that private companies , being essentially concerned with profit , indeed with short-term profits , are neglecting to invest in research .
<2en> There is actually a contradiction between the search for profit and scientific research in the interests of society as a whole .
<2en> We did not vote against this report because we are in favour of public research benefiting from considerably more resources than is currently the case , but neither did we want to sanction the way research takes second place to the race for profit .
<sp>
<2en> – The vote on this report gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to that great parliamentarian , Mr Rolf Linkohr , and to acclaim the extraordinary work done by Commissioner Busquin in the course of his term of office , which is now fast nearing its end , to give research a true European dimension .
<2en> From a quantitative point of view , we now need to move up a gear , to start to prepare the seventh FRDP , with a budget of EUR 30 million , and put pressure on those States that are not increasing , or are even in fact decreasing , their research spending .
<2en> On this depend the future of Europe , its independence , its growth and employment in it .
<sp>
<2en> . – The rough figures for Portugal ’ s current degree of investment in research and development ( R [ amp ] D ) are of enormous concern , because total spending , as a percentage of GDP , stands at approximately 0.8 % whilst State funding amounts to 65 % of the total , with 30 % coming from businesses and 5 % from abroad ( essentially from European funds ) .
<2en> Nor must it be forgotten that the future of business investment in R [ amp ] D depends on developments that are taking place in many other aspects of society , and on changes in the labour force and in the country ’ s overall development .
<2en> These are issues that go far beyond science and technology policy .
<2en> The European Parliament report is relevant because it reflects current concerns at the level of development of R [ amp ] D activities in Europe and the sector ’ s specific characteristics and needs .
<2en> One aspect that warrants particular attention is the emphasis the report gives to the need to increase investment in the public sector , observing that this is crucial to the progress of R [ amp ] D in the private sector .
<2en> Although the report is vague on a few points , it basically endorses the Commission ’ s proposals , and adds some others , specifically increasing funding under the 7th Framework Programme for R [ amp ] D ( to EUR 30 billion ) ; the creation of ‘ technology communities ’ and the creation of a European Research Council .
<sp>
<2en> . – Sustained and increased investment in research is the best guarantee of success in attaining the targets the European Union has set for itself , which are to create a more economically dynamic , cohesive economic area based on knowledge .
<2en> This will , therefore , be one of the best investments for our citizens ’ future .
<2en> This Commission Communication sets more ambitious targets than have been seen to date , by proposing measures intended to bring spending on research in the EU up to a level of 3 % of GDP , with one-third coming from public funds and two-thirds from private funds .
<2en> Today , this percentage stands at only 1.9 % , which falls considerably short of the percentages seen in the United States ( 2.7 % ) and in Japan ( 3 % ) , and reveals significant discrepancies within the Union itself .
<2en> In order to achieve this aim , annual investment in research will have to be increased by 8 % , in addition to the increase in the budgetary allocation that is needed in the context of the forthcoming accession of ten new countries .
<2en> This is also my view and I consequently voted in favour of the report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I broadly agree with the European Commission proposal .
<2en> If there is a chapter in which Portugal has made real progress on European issues , it is the chapter concerning streamlining toll charges , by introducing the ‘ Via Verde ’ [ Green Route ] , which has proven to be the most effective , practical and suitable system in Europe .
<2en> Streamlining toll charges throughout the European Union will certainly make life easier for European citizens , in particular for transport professionals and also represents a substantial step towards deepening the internal market .
<2en> I fully agreed with the ideas put forward by the rapporteur on the need – without prejudice to the concept of interoperability , which is recommended and supported – not to overlook compliance with the principle of subsidiarity with regard to each country ’ s technical choices , which would have inevitable financial consequences .
<2en> I also agree with the recommendations for prudence in the joint adoption of new technologies – these must really exist and be of proven value to users and for the need for their introduction not to distort market rules and their operation .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this proposal to extend the regulation in question .
<2en> I share the rapporteur ’ s assessment of the European Commission proposal .
<2en> In particular , I welcome the idea of extending the regulation to local organisations in developing countries , such as cultural organisations , political foundations , media associations , consumers ’ organisations , universities or even municipal authorities .
<2en> These are what we call society ’ s ‘ lifeblood ’ and they must consequently be the main architects of the development process in their countries , regions , towns and villages .
<2en> To this end and in line with its historical commitments , the EU must promote and support this form of decentralised cooperation .
<2en> Perhaps we should also consider a gradual increase in this form of cooperation , which , if its implementation is subject to rigorous quality control , could become a preferred form of cooperation and development aid .
<2en> I deplore the bigotry demonstrated by some of those on the left in demanding that the word ‘ churches ’ be replaced by ‘ philosophical or religious organisations ’ , which , in the context of the current debates on the text of the Treaty , is by no means a neutral phrase .
<2en> I therefore voted in favour of Amendment No 10 , which rectifies this point , and I welcome the fact that it was adopted in plenary with a broad majority .
<sp>
<2en> We welcome the content of this report , which seeks to promote gender equality in development cooperation and we consequently voted in favour of it .
<2en> The broad objective stated in the European Union ’ s development cooperation policy is to combat poverty and ultimately eradicate it .
<2en> In order to combat poverty effectively , however , greater practical support must be provided and other policies for cooperation and fair trade must be promoted .
<2en> We must also fight for equal rights for men and women and for women to play a greater role in the political sphere .
<2en> At the Fourth World Conference on Women , held in Beijing in 1995 , a clear agenda was established for the first time on promoting equal rights for women and men .
<2en> In the European Union this led to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2836 / 98 on integrating gender issues in development cooperation .
<2en> In 2001 , an action programme on mainstreaming gender equality in Community development cooperation was approved , but expires in 2006 .
<2en> This serves as the legal base for budget item B7-6220 ( 21.02.06 ) – ‘ Promoting equality of men and women in the framework of development cooperation ’ .
<2en> This expires on 31 December 2003 , and will have to be replaced by this proposal , which the Commission was very late in submitting .
<sp>
<2en> I congratulate Mrs Zrihen Zaari on the excellent report she has drafted on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on promoting gender equality in development cooperation , the proposals for amendments to which I fully support .
<2en> In this context , I wish to express my particular support for establishing a regulatory text that does not contain an exhaustive list of projects to be supported and which provides a real boost for launching actions to promote gender equality in development cooperation .
<2en> I also wish to emphasise the importance of giving support to the collection and dissemination of statistics in this field , because unless statistics are correctly collected , the entire process of analysing them is undermined and unless they are properly disseminated , society will not have the full picture .
<sp>
<2en> The most important aspects of development cooperation are to fund measures to combat poverty and disease and to find solutions to problems of education whilst establishing a culture of safeguarding fundamental human rights .
<2en> I am wholeheartedly in favour of adopting measures that could help achieve these aims of helping the poorest members of society and , because I believe that the rapporteur ’ s suggestions could contribute to achieving these objectives , I supported this report .
<2en> I must , however , express some concerns that I fear may not have been given due consideration .
<2en> Firstly , we must bear in mind the appalling disparities between the realities faced in developing countries and those in our own .
<2en> In societies where the main struggle is for survival , we must not dilute these prime objectives in any way .
<2en> Furthermore , we must clearly define what we mean by ‘ sexual and reproductive health , ’ to ensure that the meaning underlying this reasonable concern is not distorted and transformed into a byword for developing international programmes to promote abortion , which I would have to reject outright .
<2en> It must always be stated that ‘ sexual and reproductive health ’ means preventing sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , and guaranteeing women decent conditions for pregnancy , childbirth and postnatal care .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This proposal for a directive is based on Article 13 of the Treaty , which authorises the EU to take action to combat discrimination , in this case discrimination based on sex .
<2en> We have waited for a long time to adopt a directive on promoting equality between the sexes in areas other than work .
<2en> Discrimination based on sex is rife in the access to and supply of goods and services , both in the public and private sectors .
<2en> This proposal for a directive provides for prohibiting the use of gender as a factor in calculating insurance premiums and other financial services .
<2en> In the insurance sector , the ‘ gender ’ factor is used arbitrarily for calculating risk , simply because it is a quick and cheap method .
<2en> There is a further form of discrimination that must stop : women should not be penalised because they live longer , and certainly not because they have children and look after them .
<2en> The insurance sector must adapt its methods of calculating premiums to the principle of equal treatment and those calculations must be based on strictly objective criteria .
<2en> I consequently voted in favour of this proposal for a directive .
<sp>
<2en> By voting in favour of this report , I want to emphasise the need for a directive – based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty – on the equality of women and men in areas other than employment .
<2en> Vigilance does , however , remain appropriate , and fighting for genuine equality , actual equality between women and men in all areas of economic , social and political life , is a constant battle that must be continued .
<2en> I will take the example of the scope of the directive .
<2en> Following significant misgivings and strong resistance on the part of several interest groups , in particular the media sector , the scope of this directive has been ‘ watered down ’ to only now cover access to , and supply of , goods and services , thus leaving aside other areas such as media and advertising content , education and the decision-making process .
<2en> At any rate , this proposal must be welcomed as a logical and necessary step towards implementing a policy that will enable sexual discrimination to be fully combated and equality in areas other than employment to be guaranteed .
<sp>
<2en> This is an important report dealing with the issue of gender equality regarding access to , and supply of , services .
<2en> I agree with the Commission proposal as to the scope of the Directive .
<2en> While social protection , social security and social advantages are important areas , they cannot be considered ' services ' and are best dealt with elsewhere .
<2en> I welcome the general thrust of the proposal and share the aims which underpin it .
<2en> I believe that it will serve to reinforce values and norms which are already well established in many Member States .
<2en> Ireland , for example , adopted the ' Equal Status Act ' in 2000 , and our legislation outlaws direct and indirect discrimination , including discrimination on grounds of gender , marital status and family status .
<2en> This applies not only to the workplace and job market but also to access to , and supply of , goods and services .
<2en> In general the EU has made a very positive contribution to establishing gender equality right across a range of areas .
<2en> This is something that should be highlighted , particularly at election time .
<2en> There is too much criticism of EU regulation and the onus is on us legislators to demonstrate the host of valuable measures that have originated here which improve the status and condition of women .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her report on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services .
<2en> I support this report , especially as to the adoption of a proactive approach , in line with the approach already adopted in the Treaty .
<2en> Equality between men and women , which is a core value of European civil society , is a right that belongs to all European citizens .
<2en> It is therefore incumbent on EU institutions to protect that right in all fields .
<2en> We therefore urge the Commission to submit new proposals aimed at effectively combating discrimination based on sex and at ensuring genuine equality in areas other than work .
<sp>
<2en> This directive on equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services has been in the pipeline for a long time – it was first included on the Commission ’ s social policy agenda in June 2000 .
<2en> It is worth stating that , fortunately , equality between men and women is , today , a reality that is legally enshrined and widely enjoyed , apart from a few specific problems that still need to be ironed out .
<2en> The aim of the proposal before us is to combat discrimination in areas such as private pensions and insurance .
<2en> Recent studies have shown that insurance companies calculate premiums differently according to sex .
<2en> With types of cover in which greater life expectancy works against the interests of the insurers , women are penalised for living longer .
<2en> Car insurance , however , functions in exactly the opposite way , as statistics show that women have fewer accidents .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that the use of gender – a factor that is beyond the control of individuals – as a criterion for calculation is wrong and , since it does not stand up to objective scrutiny , constitutes discrimination .
<2en> I abstained from the final vote , however , as I feel that many aspects have not been given due consideration and that the vote in plenary on the amendments did not enable ...
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> We voted in favour of the report , despite our not agreeing with the extremely watered down way in which it describes the stranglehold of big business upon the means of expression , everywhere making little more than a nonsense of the term ‘ freedom of expression ’ .
<2en> Mr Berlusconi , who is both Prime Minister and one of the largest Italian press magnates , is , in himself , almost a caricature of this stranglehold exercised by big business over the media .
<sp>
<2en> The British Labour Members voted against paragraph 53 .
<2en> We do not accept the criticisms and overall content of this paragraph .
<2en> Nonetheless , we voted in favour of the resolution with our reservation , due to the importance of this timely report .
<sp>
<2en> The media holdings of Silvio Berlusconi are far from ideal and could cause a conflict of interest .
<2en> However , this report is far from balanced .
<2en> The title alone must suggest that freedom of expression and information are in question in Italy under the Berlusconi government .
<2en> That is stretching a point to say the least .
<2en> Practically all strands of political opinion in Italy are represented by their own newspapers .
<2en> RAI , the State broadcaster , gives a voice both to the majority and the opposition .
<2en> Indeed , even Berlusconi 's own vehicles express criticism of the government .
<2en> We in Belgium , where as in many other Member States , the media is concentrated in a small number of hands , can only dream of this .
<2en> A certain trend in left-wing opinion is very unhappy at the idea that they cannot entirely monopolise the media .
<2en> The existence of a right-wing , or apparently right-wing , counter-force in the media is seen by them as unacceptable provocation .
<2en> That is the spirit emanating from this report .
<sp>
<2en> We are concerned at the growing concentration of media ownership among an ever-decreasing number of companies .
<2en> As has been highlighted , the highest concentration of the audiovisual market anywhere in Europe is in Italy , where the market is dominated by two players , RAI and Mediaset .
<2en> Criticism of the situation in Italy must not , however , be used to deflect attention from what is happening in other countries .
<2en> In Portugal , more than one hundred of the main national media organisations are in the hands of half a dozen large companies , which , at the very least , is an alarming state of affairs .
<2en> Freedom of expression , access to information and freedom of employment are all in danger ; this is the logic of business taken to extremes .
<2en> This reality is reflected in the concerted assault by neo-liberal policies , of which media domination is one weapon .
<2en> The media is , indeed , one of the areas in which the battle over ideology and class domination is most obviously being fought .
<2en> Everything must be done , through legislation and other means , to reverse the situation , to reduce the excesses and abuses taking place , and staunchly to defend public radio and television worthy of the name .
<sp>
<2en> Ownership of or control over newspapers , television and websites is becoming increasingly important in managing information and propaganda .
<2en> If all media become concentrated in the same hands then we will be going back to the days in the past when the media had less reach and often a monopoly was created involving the authorities , a powerful party , the Church or a regional publisher .
<2en> People only heard one opinion as to what was good or bad , and how society should develop .
<2en> Government and big business are still trying to achieve that .
<2en> In Spain recently the previous government tried to shift the blame for three major bomb attacks onto a separatist movement rather than an international movement because that would be better for them in the elections .
<2en> In Italy , the Prime Minister controls the commercial company MEDIASET as its owner and the State-run company RAI thanks to his role in government .
<2en> The Christian Democrat group shies away from criticising this situation and have attempted to keep this topic off the agenda by ignoring the problems , holding endless procedural debates and submitting enormous numbers of amendments .
<2en> They are abusing democracy in order to abolish democracy .
<2en> I support the rapporteur in her attempts to deal with cable monopolies as well and to push for statutory measures aimed at protecting freedom and diversity of opinion in the media .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Thank you for your clarification , Mr Barón Crespo , but I am not sure that it was as useful as I would have liked it to have been !
<2en> We have over 600 votes to get through this morning .
<2en> We could have a lot of fun ; we could spend the next 30 or 40 minutes playing games on this , or we can get on with the vote .
<2en> I will give the floor to Mr Podestà because he was named and therefore has the right to make a personal statement , but I will not take a series of points of order .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I believe that I can say to you and to my fellow Members that the explanations that Mr Barón Crespo has just given are the most pathetic that I have heard in ten years of parliamentary life here .
<2en> I would also like to take the liberty of noting that , in his letter to Mr Cox , Mr Barón Crespo , when quoting what was published yesterday in the in my name , completely misinterpreted it and changed the wording .
<2en> This is serious , Mr Barón Crespo , because I wrote that the Committee on Citizens ’ Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has breached some of the Rules of Procedure , which is why I sent Mr Cox a letter , to which he sent a reply , which I answered .
<2en> The difference between saying ‘ breached some of the Rules ’ and saying ‘ systematic breaches ’ is merely one of intellectual integrity , or otherwise .
<2en> It means saying ‘ black ’ or ‘ white ’ : it is one thing to raise some points ; it is another thing to say that our Rules of Procedure have systematically not been respected .
<2en> I will take the liberty – in conclusion , Mr President – of making one remark .
<2en> You said that yesterday the House voted on something that is , in any case , the sole responsibility of the President , but since we chose – or rather , since he chose – Rule 130 ( 3 ) without considering that paragraph 1 , which is binding , says that first of all amendments are put to the vote and then the text , we – or perhaps not we , but someone here whose responsibility it was – betrayed this Parliament ’ s sense of democracy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am indeed aware of the letter which Mr Barón Crespo sent to the President 's office concerning his unfortunate and malicious statements of yesterday , and confirming them in exactly the same terms as in his speech .
<2en> On the other hand , Mr President , and according to the explanations given by the secretariat of my committee , and of which the Presidency is directly aware from the note which was sent to it , it is absolutely clear that all , absolutely all , the documents were available in the Committee on Freedoms at the start of the day on the 20th .
<2en> Documents which , moreover , are public and which , besides being available in the documentation department , are also available on the Internet .
<2en> Therefore , Mr President , I would emphasise that no political group – including the Group of the Party of European Socialists – nor any member of the Committee on Freedoms made any comment or statement on the matter , neither during the course of voting on the amendments nor at the start of the same .
<2en> Furthermore , Mr President , at the end of the sitting I was congratulated by all the political groups for the way in which the work had been carried out .
<2en> In conclusion , Mr President , and in Spanish , Mr Barón Crespo has lied , manipulated the truth and insulted us , in addition to casting doubt on the good name of the Members of this House , of the officials and also the assistants of the political groups .
<sp>
<2en> The President has not responded to the request of the chairman of my group to have the verbatim Minutes of yesterday 's sitting revised .
<2en> As he himself has just admitted , Mr Barón Crespo spoke to a fellow Member yesterday , saying , ' [ be quiet , wretch ] ' .
<2en> Mr President , this is not only an arrogant expression , it also shows contempt for an opponent which is incompatible with the democratic spirit .
<sp>
<2en> Mr Galeote Quecedo , you were as helpful as a wet Friday in November .
<2en> Because of your contribution , which was not on the subject you said it would be on , I now have no choice but to give the floor to everyone else who asked to speak on this subject !
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I congratulate the rapporteur .
<2en> I should like to highlight the proposed amendment to Article 1 of the Commission ’ s draft decision , on the application of Article 86 of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
<2en> I would be in favour , however , of extending the range of beneficiaries to cover the outermost regions .
<2en> In this connection , I recall that the Commission ’ s communications entitled ‘ A stronger partnership for the outermost regions ’ and ‘ A stronger partnership for the outermost regions : assessment and perspectives ’ provided for the introduction of simplified rules for awarding public service contracts in the area of maritime transport serving small islands , with a volume of fewer than 100 000 passengers a year .
<2en> I also wish to point out that in the outermost regions the liberalisation of services and use of infrastructures were made conditional on the introduction of public service obligations , in order to offset the handicaps due to the physical and other characteristics of the outermost regions .
<2en> I should also like to highlight that there are other services of general economic interest of importance to the outermost regions , such as postal services and telecommunications .
<2en> Hence the importance to the outermost regions of these two Commission documents .
<2en> I therefore feel that the unique situation of these regions must be taken into account in those legal instruments .
<sp>
<2en> Without funding and planning by national , regional and local authorities , we would not have proper public transport , or generally accessible education and health care .
<2en> The idea of an authority withdrawing and admitting free competition is pernicious to such vital activities .
<2en> If that happens , there will undoubtedly be small privileged groups who consider that they have more freedom of choice and their individual needs are better catered for , but the large majority , and society as a whole , will be worse off .
<2en> This report defends the neo-liberal vision , and even wants to set down an interpretation of the Altmark ruling about the possibility of the underhand assignation of concessions in public transport .
<2en> The Commission and Parliament have waited for this legal judgment for years , because there was an abundance of contradicting interpretations about authorities ’ provision of services , about funding and competition .
<2en> There is now a legal judgment that leaves intact local authorities ’ right to offer public transport .
<2en> The Commission intends to table an amended proposal following on from my proposals adopted by this House on 14 November 2001 .
<2en> I reject neo-liberal interpretations that stand in the way of this .
<sp>
<2en> Although some very good ideas were expressed , it was particularly important for the European Parliamentary Labour Party that the impact on social housing and health services was taken into account .
<2en> This is why it was very important for the Purvis compromises to be included in the various articles mentioned during the vote .
<sp>
<2en> The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left rejects the report , as it does not stand up to the pressure emanating from the Commission to privatise services of general interest , but , if anything , intensifies that pressure in parts .
<2en> It is made even more difficult for municipalities , regions and Member States to offer the services to the public that they are often legally required to provide .
<2en> Public undertakings will have to compete even more with global operators in the field of service provision .
<2en> From the public ’ s point of view , the provision of public services will further deteriorate : the market functions according to neither social yardsticks nor need , but simply lucrative demand .
<2en> We are particularly critical of the fact that compensation for services of general economic interest will continue fundamentally to be treated as ‘ state aid ’ and will therefore still come under the state aid regime .
<2en> In addition , only a few public undertakings will continue to receive compensation in any case .
<2en> The report also strengthens the Commission proposal as regards hospitals and social housing .
<2en> Instead of extending the exemptions provided for , to cover at least care services , education , culture and the public media , bureaucratic procedures are now being called for across the board .
<2en> The report totally fails to mention those employed in undertakings providing services of general interest and the general interests of social welfare , such as the protection of the weaker members of society .
<2en> For the big service providers , privatisation initiatives in the field of services of general interest mean profitable business .
<2en> Anyone helping them to achieve those objectives should be conscious of what they are doing .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen .
<2en> Mass unemployment , lack of growth , repeated budget deficits , the explosion of public debt , stifling taxation , relocations ... unfortunately everyone is aware of our sad economic situation .
<2en> Your recipes for dealing with these problems are always the same .
<2en> According to you , the reason that everything is going badly is that there is not enough European standardisation .
<2en> Not enough competition between the European economies , not enough competition in services , not enough openness to global competition , with no regard for whether or not it is fair , not enough immigration of qualified workers , too much social protection .
<2en> Overloaded bureaucracy ?
<2en> That is purely a national problem .
<2en> Your regulations , which are unconsolidated , dense , sometimes incoherent if not absurd , are not responsible !
<2en> But the monetary policy , which is causing an over-valuation of the euro and draining our economies ?
<2en> It is perfect .
<2en> Neither Brussels nor Frankfurt could get it wrong .
<2en> We think , however , that the Europe of Brussels is getting it wrong .
<2en> Despite 20 years of standardisation , and Europe entering into global free trade , our problems are only getting worse .
<2en> And the reason for that is precisely this policy , your policy .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I will be happy to bear this in mind , especially because the Sittings Service has asked me to avoid using shortened names for the groups , as I have been doing .
<2en> I will therefore do as you ask .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to alert you to an error in some of the language versions of Amendment 29 .
<2en> The original version , or in other words the English version , is the authentic text , which reads as follows ;
<2en> ‘ Urges the Commission to come forward with an initiative to ensure … ’
<2en> and not ‘ come forward with an initiative on liberalisation ’ , as stated in the French version , because one of the aims of this amendment , which was tabled by mutual agreement , was to delete these words .
<sp>
<2en> I agree with you entirely , Mr Désir , that the words ‘ on liberalisation ’ have been included in the French version by mistake .
<2en> I should like to make this clear , and also to note that Amendment 29 falls .
<2en> Although the texts will in any case be checked later , the amendment falls because one of the two parts of Amendment 5 has been adopted .
<sp>
<2en> In my opinion , the fact that the first part of Amendment 5 by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has been adopted does not mean that Amendment 29 should fall .
<sp>
<2en> The amendments relate to the same words , Mr Désir , ‘ new initiative ’ and ‘ initiative ’ .
<2en> Amendment 29 falls , but your correction was relevant and an account of the whole matter will be given to the House .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I believe that Sweden should participate in Economic and Monetary Union and I share the rapporteur ’ s positive attitude to the euro .
<2en> I have , however , chosen to abstain from voting on this report .
<2en> One of the main conclusions of the report is that the Commission should conduct an information campaign extolling the virtues of the euro .
<2en> I believe that information campaigns by the Commission are neither helpful nor appropriate if we want to see more people well disposed towards the euro .
<2en> That is not what we should be using taxpayers ’ money for .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to congratulate Mr Maaten on his important report on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , particularly given the need to explain to the people how the euro and the EMU benefits them in their daily lives .
<2en> The successful creation of the euro zone is not complete – we still have to convince the citizens of Europe that they made the right decision .
<2en> This is the only way in which we can contribute towards consolidating monetary union in Europe and towards enhancing the euro ’ s credibility and stability .
<2en> It is inevitable that the euro zone will expand to include the countries of Eastern Europe .
<2en> This will entail drawing up an information plan as part of a wider information and communication strategy on the EU .
<2en> We need to keep a closer watch on instances of malpractice and excessive rounding up that may occur during the transition and to warn the population of a slight rise in inflation .
<sp>
<2en> The Euro has clearly been an economic success in the countries that have adopted it - it has eliminated exchange risk within the euro zone , made travel easier and increased trade within the zone .
<2en> Nevertheless , it is dispiriting to note that despite the objective benefits of the euro and despite the generally smooth change over that occurred , seven years on , a significant section ( about one third ) of the public continues to have a negative perception of the euro .
<2en> Baffling as this may appear the Commission , Member States and other policy makers need to take stock of these perceptions and undertake steps to correct them .
<2en> This report could make a worthwhile contribution to that effect .
<sp>
<2en> The only benefit the euro has brought is that people do not need to exchange currency when they go on holiday to another euro country .
<2en> Other than that , the general experience of most people in euro countries has been of the currency ’ s drawbacks , such as higher prices for consumer goods and a reduction in the value of their savings .
<2en> They are annoyed about the constant cutbacks on public services that are being carried out in order to limit public spending and thus meet the requirements of the Stability Pact .
<2en> In his report , Mr Maaten reveals himself as an enthusiast for the euro , a ‘ europhile ’ .
<2en> It is laughable that he should call the euro ‘ the most successful European project ever ’ .
<2en> Does he realise that the euro gave some people a reason to vote against the EU Constitution ?
<2en> How does he explain that Member States without the euro are doing far better economically speaking ?
<2en> His main concern is to help the governments of Sweden , Denmark and the UK persuade the public that the euro has been a success .
<2en> Such an admission of weakness is comparable to the campaign in favour of the EU Constitution in the Netherlands : the euro is talked up as a fantastic product , yet people have not yet got the message .
<2en> It is short-sighted and patronising to respond to serious public criticism with transparent campaigns .
<sp>
<2en> The advantages – and the disadvantages , which of course exist – of the euro are there for all to see and it cannot be denied that our highest expectations have been met .
<2en> Whilst it is true that the economic situation in Europe is not a runaway success story , it is also true that the euro cannot be blamed for this situation .
<2en> Indeed , the citizens have taken to the new currency very positively and the speed and ease with which the transition took place should not be forgotten .
<2en> It should also be borne in mind , however , that the euro is in fact a work in progress and as such is an easy target both for genuine popular disenchantment with the economic situation in Europe and for a certain amount of political manipulation .
<2en> This currency is too valuable to be discarded .
<2en> I therefore feel that we should agree on a more wide-ranging and complete communication plan , especially at institutional level .
<2en> It is clear that this is an ongoing transition process .
<2en> The initial effort needs to be kept up .

<en> The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<en> We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall , Madam President , that at the beginning of the last session , I raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the Members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet .
<en> You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening .
<en> I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and , if so , whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so .
<sp>
<en> I can tell you , Mr Davies , that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members ' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve .
<en> But we shall have a decision very soon .
<en> ( The Minutes were adopted )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report on the outcome of the Hong Kong WTO meeting comes at a crucial time , as the negotiations currently hang in the balance .
<2en> We voted today to send a strong political signal to the negotiating parties , including the EU , to honour commitments to a successful conclusion of this round geared towards the poorest countries , as agreed at Doha .
<2en> As Labour 's spokesperson on International Trade , I submitted a number of amendments to this report at its committee stage .
<2en> Then , as now , I called for the exclusion of key public services ( including water ) from liberalisation drives .
<2en> On the paragraph relating to NAMA , I called for flexibility in the number and range of coefficients used in formulating tariff cuts , so as to leave adequate policy space for developing countries to choose the rate at which they liberalise .
<2en> I voted for a similar amendment today .
<2en> On agriculture , whilst I agree with the Commission 's assessment that negotiations should be pursued in parallel with those of other sectors , I could not vote in favour of calls by some colleagues for the current EU offer to be made conditional and even retractable .
<2en> I believe the current offer should at least be maintained .
<sp>
<2en> The Papastamkos report on the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong has led us to make two remarks .
<2en> Firstly , it should not be difficult to understand that international trade has tremendous potential to promote development and prosperity .
<2en> On the one hand , the more commercial transactions , the higher the level of dependency and cooperation between the Member States .
<2en> On the other hand , the more intense the international trade , the greater the economic prosperity of the various countries , which will help to improve people ’ s living conditions and to make the world a safer place .
<2en> Secondly , the inevitable conclusion is that anyone wishing to see a world with more trade and more fair trade , a world in which the rules are complied with , will almost certainly leave the summit disappointed .
<2en> As 2006 goes on , we are further and further away from the objective of successfully finishing the round , begun in 2001 , by the end of this year .
<2en> If this aim is to be achieved , however , we need to reach agreement on the advantages of free trade and on the rules to which that free trade needs to be subject .
<sp>
<2en> This report has been amended so much that it was not possible for me to support it , even though I agree with some of the points .
<2en> The aims of the ' Make Poverty History ' campaign and the march in Edinburgh last summer have so comprehensively not been met that it is a sorely missed opportunity .
<2en> We could have sent a louder , clearer message today to our governments and to the European Commission .
<2en> Instead we have virtually endorsed the status quo which I do not want to see continue .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to explain why I ultimately voted against the report in the final vote .
<2en> It was because Amendment 22 , which condemned the Commission 's insistence on liberalising services within the EU and elsewhere without supporting this with appropriate social and environmental legislation , was rejected .
<2en> I fully agree with the fact that no country should be forced to liberalise any service sector and that sectors such as health , water supply , education and audiovisual services in particular must be excluded from liberalisation .
<2en> This part of the amendment was narrowly defeated : 291 in favour , 299 against and 20 abstentions .
<2en> For that reason , I did not want to vote in favour during the final vote .
<sp>
<2en> – Τhe Kommounistiko Komma Elladas voted against the report on the assessment of the Doha Round , because it moves in and repeats the reactionary , anti-grass roots framework of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong and the extravagant claims of Euro-unifying capital , as defined and promoted in splendid cooperation with the USA .
<2en> The objective of the ΕU and the USA during the negotiations which are under way is even greater exploitation of the peoples and the wealth-producing resources of the developed , capitalist countries and even more of the developing and less developed countries .
<2en> The ΕU and the USA , together with the other imperialist powers , are proceeding with the selective opening of the markets and the abolition of subsidies for agricultural products , to the detriment of small- and medium-sized farms , so that monopoly capital can penetrate the markets of the developing and less developed countries for full control of industrial products , the provision of services and the extortionate exploitation of water , energy and so forth , in order to maximise its profitability .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in accordance with the PSE Group ’ s guidelines except for those amendments on which we , the Malta Labour Party MEPs , agreed to vote otherwise .
<2en> I want to record the following in explanation .
<2en> Carbon dioxide emissions by cars are more likely to be less voluminous in new cars .
<2en> Car makers are now conscious of the need to reduce emissions and use the latest technologies .
<2en> Registration tax when abused by government raises the price of cars exorbitantly .
<2en> In Malta and Gozo , with the exception of Denmark , car prices are the highest in the EU .
<2en> Car registration tax should be removed and until such time agreement should be reached on uniformity within the different states .
<2en> The fee for the annual car licence should be based on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions .
<2en> Revenues from car-related taxes should be used to improve and sustain car-related infrastructures , mainly road construction , maintenance , parking areas , safety measures and landscaping .
<2en> Income from car registration in Malta and Gozo is comparatively very high whilst the road infrastructure is the worst in the EU .
<2en> The problem of carbon dioxide emissions is especially acute in commercial and public transport vehicles .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of the report in order to send out an important signal concerning the reorganisation of taxes for the benefit of the environment .
<2en> Taxes should continue to fall within the national competence , and it is fortunate that a decision concerning Mrs Riis-Jørgensen ’ s desire to limit tax revenues for welfare services cannot lawfully be taken at EU level .
<sp>
<2en> VRT for Ireland is a national tax and setting the rate of taxation is therefore a national competence .
<2en> The Irish rate of VRT has been sanctioned under EU law .
<2en> It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State or indeed the Commission to decide upon the tax policy of Member States .
<2en> This report suggests that the abolition of VRT will be good for the Irish consumer .
<2en> This is not strictly true .
<2en> Ireland gains EUR 1.15 billion from VRT .
<2en> If it abolished VRT Irish motorists would have to bear the costs of its abolition by paying a 20 cent increase in the price of petrol or diesel , or an increase from EUR 400 to EUR 900 in their annual motor tax .
<2en> I do not believe this would be in the interest of Irish motorists .
<2en> I can see the benefits of introducing tax incentives to motorists to purchase vehicles with reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency .
<2en> However , it should be up to each Member State to decide how this should be done .
<2en> Preserving the flexibility of Member States to decide what taxes to apply and at what rates is vital in achieving the social and economic objective of a country .
<sp>
<2en> I support both objectives of this proposal for a directive : to improve the functioning of the internal market while also taking the opportunity to achieve dramatic reduction in CO2 emissions .
<2en> I also believe that the proposals could lead to significant improvement in road safety in that by providing motorists with an opportunity to pay less for new , more environmentally friendly cars , we would encourage the gradual replacement of the car fleet with safer vehicles .
<2en> In voting for the Riis-Jorgensen report today I also fully support the much more imaginative environmental demands made in this report .
<2en> Whereas the European Commission has called for graduated taxes designed to penalise carbon dioxide emissions , the European Parliament calls for the focus to cover all pollutants and fuel efficiency .
<2en> We need imaginative steps like this if we are to stand any chance of reducing the threat of global warming .
<sp>
<2en> British Conservative MEPs strongly support the objective of improving the natural environment in which we live .
<2en> In addition to the environmental aspects of the report that we support , we also support the avoidance of British citizens being taxed double when they move abroad and the rights of consumers to benefit from an enhanced single market .
<2en> Our decision to abstain on the final vote does not imply that we are opposed to the requirement for urgent measures to improve the environment .
<2en> Many of the measures in the report can be supported , but we are opposed to passing new and additional powers to the European Commission and other European institutions when the same objectives can be achieved at national level .
<2en> Importantly , we cannot support the call in this report to give the European Commission tax powers at the expense of national governments and , for this reason , as well as our general opposition to handing more powers to the Commission , we abstained on the final vote .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , according to our voting lists , Amendment 9 will lapse if Amendment 21 , tabled by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , is adopted .
<en> I should like to ask that Amendment 9 be voted on in addition to Amendment 21 , which stipulates 20 % as a basis for sustainable energy and in our amendment , that of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , we advocate 25 % by way of gradual increase .
<en> This could therefore be seen as an addition .
<en> If it is voted on additionally , I should like to ask our group to vote in favour of Amendment 21 .
<sp>
<en> As there does not appear to be any opposition on your part to Mrs Corbey 's proposal , we are therefore going to vote on these two amendments .

<en> ( HU ) The European Union has reached a mature age , and it seems that it has also gained the appropriate wisdom , since it has succeeded in adopting a concise document that concentrates on values , principles and the tasks that lie ahead , and that is at the same time comprehensible for the average person .
<en> The Union has thus demonstrated that it is able to speak with one voice and is ready to take action based on values .
<en> This declaration celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , but I would like to recall another 50th anniversary as well , namely that of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution , which is equally present at the roots , origins and traditions of today 's European Union .
<en> Without the example of 1956 and of the Hungarian revolutionaries , the European Union would not have been able to develop in the way in which it has done , in what we can now refer to as our common Europe .
<en> I am convinced that we need a European Union that is strong , self-confident about its values and identity , refusing to yield from its principles and incapable of any subterfuge .
<en> We would like to see a Union that deepens the cooperation of its Member States , fosters internal collaboration and moves toward greater solidarity and political integration .
<en> Why is a strong European Union in our interest ?
<en> Because with it , each individual state can also grow considerably stronger .
<en> In order to be strong , it is also important , of course , that we be capable of clearly recognising our past and our identity .
<en> I celebrated the 50th anniversary in Rome at a conference organised by a civil society organisation , and I would like to pass on to you one of the messages of this conference , namely , that we must indeed recognise our identity , and recognise and affirm the roots of Europe , its Christian roots .
<en> Everyone who looks at Europe from the outside sees in us what it is that is common to us all .
<en> Why do we fail to see this ourselves , and why are we afraid to acknowledge it ?
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Mr Szájer , not least for your cooperation in the internal coordination , in which you had a hand .

<en> ( PL ) The Berlin Declaration was signed at a very important moment for the European Union .
<en> The signing of the Treaties of Rome 50 years ago was the first step in the implementation of an ambitious idea .
<en> The presence of twenty-seven states in Berlin reflected the impact of this idea .
<en> When the Union was founded in the ruins of post-war Europe , the founding declaration was signed by just six states .
<en> Now , half a century on , it is a joy that Europe is living in peace .
<en> It has almost half a billion inhabitants .
<en> It covers a large part of the continent and is a greater force in the world than ever .
<en> The results of integration are impressive : a unified market , a common currency in thirteen states and the free movement of people , goods and capital .
<en> The European Union has taken on commitments to protect the environment and to work towards sustainable development .
<en> It is an active and high-profile player in the international arena , bringing stability and prosperity to neighbouring countries .
<en> The Berlin Declaration is an important symbol for Europe .
<en> However , something is still lacking , despite the clear sense of achievement .
<en> We might have wished for the European Union to have a Constitution on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaties .
<en> We still face a number of challenges : global economic competition , new challenges in the fields of social policy , environmental protection , energy and security .
<en> Europe 's citizens want a more effective and stronger Union , operating on the basis of transparent rules .
<en> We should remove the barriers facing citizens , particularly in the new Member States , in relation to the free movement of people and services .
<en> We have to finish enlarging the Schengen and the euro zones .
<en> We need to implement a common energy policy .
<en> Europe needs economic growth , new jobs and better social security .
<en> In this context , the point in the Declaration which states that the institutional foundations of Europe have to be agreed by 2009 is of great importance .
<en> It should motivate all Member States to carry out the necessary institutional reforms .
<en> Chancellor Angela Merkel deserves praise for her significant contribution to our common success .
<en> Today the European Union has a female face .
<en> The Union is a woman .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) There has been talk here , Mr President , of the importance of a European climate change policy .
<en> Is that possible with the current Treaties ?
<en> No .
<en> There has also been talk of the social integration of immigrants .
<en> Is that possible with the current Treaties ?
<en> No .
<en> And what about a single energy market ?
<en> It has no legal basis in the current Treaties .
<en> I say this because to contrast what some have called ' the real polices of concern to the citizens ' with instruments and techniques , as if the latter were not important , simply shows ignorance of how the European Union works .
<en> Without procedures , without legal bases , the European Union cannot act , and without more democracy , it will be acting without legitimacy .
<en> That is why it is so important that we reach an agreement on the Constitutional Treaty .
<en> I believe that , following the German Presidency 's success at the Berlin event , that is what we must now be working towards .
<en> I hope that the European Council in June will provide for that .
<en> It does not need to be done unanimously , and I believe that it is very important to set the mandate .
<en> And on setting the mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference - and a university teacher is speaking here - we must take account of those who have passed the exam , in some cases with distinction , and we must help those who have failed it and those who have not taken it , but we must not just take account of those who have failed or not taken it .
<en> Those of us who have ratified it , therefore , have fulfilled our commitment and we must be taken into account when that mandate is established .
<en> It has been said here , and quite rightly , that this Parliament , via yourself , Mr President , has made a decisive contribution to the Berlin Declaration .
<en> I believe that we want to do the same in the Intergovernmental Conference : we all want to help the European Council , because the Commission is part of the Intergovernmental Conference , because the national parliaments are going to ratify the result of that Conference .
<en> But we want to make a decisive contribution to ensuring that the Intergovernmental Conference is as great a success as the Berlin Declaration , at least .
<sp>

<en> in writing . - ( IT ) The terrible fires which struck Greece and southern Italy in particular this summer , leaving victims in their wake and destroying thousands of hectares of woodland and agricultural land , again highlight the urgent need for better coordination of rapid reaction measures by Member States ' civil protection forces .
<en> To that end , it is now clear that a European Civil Protection Agency needs to be set up to coordinate and manage measures to eradicate or prevent the causes of disasters .
<en> That Agency - which the writer has proposed that the Commission set up on a number of occasions , on the basis of the positive experience of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency - would not just be responsible for combating the devastating fires that cause enormous damage every year in the Mediterranean countries , but would also take swift action to tackle the emergencies following on from all kinds of disasters brought about by natural events , such as the floods from which Bulgaria has recently suffered , or man-made events .
<en> It has to be stressed that disasters may be supranational in nature , and Europe should not just rely solely on the generosity of volunteers or on the competences and resources of the particular State that has been affected , but should have enough human and financial resources and appropriate equipment to enable swift action to be taken .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) For the sake of consistency , in view of what we have said in the past and what we expect from the European Solidarity Fund , I shall clearly be voting for this resolution .

<en> European integration , among countless other advantages , has the advantage of scale and the economies of scale that come with solidarity .
<en> Without in any way diminishing the responsibilities of Member States and their governments , it is possible and desirable through an effort of solidarity at European level to face the disasters that are caused by nature and its increasing unpredictability rather than by any mistakes in the management of the land .
<en> However , while insisting on this point , we cannot leave the human factor out of account , when a criminal starts a fire or when a plan for the land opens the way for such disasters or exacerbates their consequences .
<en> I therefore believe it is time to review many of our policies , particularly in the area of forest and woodland management and rural development but not only in that area : we also need to look at our environmental measures , so as to prevent Man from becoming even more destructive than the destructive force of Nature .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Over 60 dead and 184 000 hectares of land gone up in smoke : that is the toll of the fires that swept through Greece at the end of August .
<en> Europe was not a passive observer .
<en> Solidarity came fully into play through the ' European rapid reaction instrument ' that we voted for last March , a joint civil protection system in which 30 States make resources such as Canadairs , tankers and qualified personnel ( ' green berets ' ) available to countries suffering man-made or natural disasters .
<en> I am not fanatical about the systematic transfer of competences to Europe , but I do believe that a Community civil protection system is worthwhile , because natural disasters know no borders .
<en> I have said so several times in this House , especially at the time of the disastrous fires in Portugal in 2003 .
<en> The European Union urgently needs to demonstrate its benefits .
<en> It must serve as a model , so that there is solidarity between all the citizens of Europe , and not just in this particular disaster .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The catastrophic storm in December 1999 , floods in Central Europe in 2002 , fires in Portugal and Spain in 2004 , and now fires in Greece in which people have lost their lives , and also in Romania and Bulgaria : each time there is a strong emotional response , each time Europe sympathises , each time the Commission promises to improve its solidarity and its aid mechanisms .
<en> Right here , on 18 January 2000 in fact , I called for the creation of a public safety Eurocorps , and the idea was taken up by Commissioner Barnier in his May 2006 report .
<en> Right here in this Parliament , we have called in vain for the renewal of the 1992 regulation under which funding would be provided for fire-prevention equipment such as firebreaks , access roads and monitoring systems .
<en> Now we must not wait for the next disaster , for more victims .
<en> Let us put the Barnier proposal into practice .
<en> There is a military Eurocorps .
<en> Surely Europe can set up a public safety Eurocorps for itself , to protect its citizens against natural and accidental risks ?
<en> Then we should ask Member States to draw up plans to prevent forest fires and help them , encourage them , to finance these through a specific financing instrument similar to that in the old 1992 regulation .
<en> When we are facing climate change , it is in the interests of the whole of Europe to introduce ambitious prevention policies .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) As far as the regions are concerned , given that their role in the legislative process means that they are often directly responsible for implementing and enforcing EU law , the efforts to achieve better regulation are extremely important .
<en> Bodies at different levels of national and local government , economic and social partners , representatives of civil society and non-governmental organisations must - as far as possible - participate actively in the consultation process on European law-making .
<en> Equally important is their role in the assessing the influence and effect of this legislation on the Member States .
<en> This will increase the quality , clarity and transparency of the regulations being prepared , while taking account of local and regional conditions and differences .
<en> In this way we will also prevent wrong interpretations as well as delays in the transposition and implementation of legislation .

<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I am voting in favour of Georg Jarzembowski 's report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91 / 440 / EEC on the development of the Community 's railways and Directive 2001 / 14 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure .
<en> The Third Railway Package constitutes a very important element of the regulations on transport .
<en> International passenger transport networks need to be opened up , and the European Commission should analyse the situation in the international passenger transport market with a view to taking a decision on further liberalisation which also covers national transport .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I welcome the possibility of cross-border train traffic , but for a market to function properly competition must be on equal terms .
<en> It is therefore unfortunate that the EU is forcing through legislation under which countries that have not yet deregulated railway transport are to be given the right to compete with operators on a deregulated market where international train services are concerned .
<en> In practice this proposal gives state-aided railway companies the possibility of competing on a market where there is free competition , which in the long term poses the risk of deactivating market mechanisms .
<en> I have therefore chosen to vote against this report .
<en> State-aided railway companies should not be allowed to compete on a market with free competition .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The proposal for a directive on the ' forms part of the ' Third Railway Package ' , which aims principally to promote the liberalisation of international rail passenger services .
<en> Here too , it should above all be stressed that the first objective of this directive will be , through harmonisation , to remove any obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail passenger services which might derive from different rules on professional requirements in the sector within each country .
<en> The measure will also favour worker mobility in the sector .
<en> In addition to the important set of questions which such a directive poses , it must be stressed that the adoption of harmonised rules at Community level on the certification of workers in the rail sector of each country must never jeopardise more progressive rights or standards already established at the level of each Member State , or deny the prerogative of each Member State to establish those rights and standards .
<en> Here , too , reality shows that it is the liberalisation and privatisation of rail services which has jeopardised workers ' rights and reduced the number of workers in the rail sector , with serious consequences for the level of service provided .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I am voting for a standard driving licence for train drivers .
<en> The harmonisation of training for drivers will also ensure greater safety in future on the railways .
<en> A minimum age of 20 and an appropriate school education and language training are now compulsory as conditions for being allowed to work as a train driver in international rail transport .
<en> The standardisation of training is key to a European rail network .
<en> The driving licence issued in a Member State will be recognised in future by all the other Member States .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The ' Third Railway Package ' , which aims principally to promote the liberalisation of international rail passenger services , contains a regulation on ' rail passengers ' rights and obligations ' .
<en> Above all , we can state that the essential aim of this regulation is to remove any obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail passenger services which might derive from different rules on passengers ' rights and obligations in the various countries .
<en> In addition to stressing this first point - which is the central issue - we certainly consider that it is essential to safeguard passengers ' rights , starting with the right to a public rail transport service provided by public undertakings in each country .
<en> Reality shows that it is the liberalisation and privatisation of rail services that jeopardise passengers ' rights : they have led to a deterioration in the services offered to the public and in the conditions for passenger mobility as well as an increase in fares ; they have meant the loss of hundreds of kilometres of track , station closures , a reduction in the number of workers in the rail sector and a threat to their pay and to labour rights .
<en> This is a disastrous policy opposed by workers and the public .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - I support the report on reform of the sugar sector , although there are some areas of concern with this report .
<en> I do not agree with the report in its intent to apply the process of withdrawal of sugar surplus to cane refiners .
<en> This is in contrast to the Commission proposal to exclude cane refining from the withdrawal process .
<en> As the refiners are not directly part of the restructuring scheme , to reduce by withdrawal the refiners ' traditional supply needs ( TSNs ) would have no effect on reducing the surplus of sugar on the EU market , because the EU would still have to meet its international obligation to import specified quantities of raw sugar from ACP countries .
<en> The amendment would , however , tend to weaken the impact of the measure in providing incentives to beet processors to dismantle their plant .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I shall be voting in favour of the report that has been prepared by Ms Batzeli , because it is quite obvious that a restructuring of the sugar industry is required .
<en> My only concern relates to Amendment 31 , which , if passed , would still commit the European Commission to keeping the existing fund open up to 2011 , and would be a negative aspect of this restructuring process .
<en> This report , whilst not perfect , nevertheless strikes a balance between the needs of the producers and the obvious need to reform this sector .
<en> My only concern regards the effect any restructuring could have on sugar cane producers from developing countries .
<en> At all costs we must avoid a restructuring that protects beet producers at the expense of cane producers and I would hope that the Commission will ensure that this does not happen , whilst still being fair to our own farmers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - When voting on agriculture reports such as this report on sugar , Members with a financial interest should declare it or decline from voting .
<sp>
<2en> We should support the EU 's commitment to achieving the ambitious goal of generating 20 % of total energy consumed in Europe from renewable sources by 2020 .
<2en> Renewable energy offers numerous advantages for Europe : lower CO2 emissions , reduced European dependency and a contribution to job creation and growth .
<2en> However , we need to monitor the development of all renewable energy from the point of view of sustainability , depending of course on the capacities of the Member States , as well as saving energy through lower consumption and increased energy efficiency .
<2en> I regret that the Directive on electricity from renewable energy sources does not make cogeneration compulsory and will lead to the building of large-scale biomass power stations without cogeneration , which are not energy efficient and destabilise the market in timber for both industrial and energy generation purposes .
<2en> There are examples of this in my own region , Limousin .
<2en> I am pleased therefore that the European Parliament is asking for a proposal on the heating and cooling sectors to be central to the future Framework Directive on renewable energies and I therefore voted in favour of the Thomsen Report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the Thomsen report on the Roadmap for Renewable Energy in Europe , since I believe that increasing investment in renewable energy is essential to reduce the European Union 's external energy dependence , cut CO2 emissions , and therefore help to combat climate change .
<en> This report underscores the importance of the sustainable use of biofuels in the transport sector in order to reduce oil dependency and greenhouse gas emissions , thus lessening the environmental impact .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I support the recommendations made in the resolution .
<en> However , as regards the PMOI , I voted against the amendments referring to the group in the text .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The opinions of Javier Solana and of EU representatives and supporting parties have put paid to any illusions about the EU 's position with regard to Iran and the Middle East generally .
<en> These opinions prove that the EU is in favour of promoting the US-NATO plan for ' democratising the Middle East ' , which aims to subject nations and peoples to control of their wealth-producing resources .
<en> The assurances on behalf of the IAEA and the CIA 's report on Iran 's non-military use of nuclear energy are deliberately being ignored by the EU , which is stepping up the pressure with sanctions against Iran , and is intensifying propaganda to accustom public opinion to the idea of a war against Iran .
<en> Furthermore , Javier Solana has clearly linked the situation in Lebanon and the wider area with the issue of nuclear weapons - without , however , making any reference to Israel 's nuclear weapons .
<en> In the wider area of the Middle East , we are witnessing the emergence of imperialist aggression and clashes over the sharing out of markets .
<en> The victims of this are , among others , the peoples of Palestine , Iran and Lebanon .
<en> The only answer to these new aggressive , warlike plans is for citizens to resist imperialism and harbour no illusions about the role of the EU .
<en> Those who are in a position to decide on issues of human rights and their violation are the citizens of each country ; they should not allow themselves to become an excuse for another Iraq .
<sp>
<2en> Iran is currently a regional and global threat and a challenge to the EU Member States ' ability to stand firm together on the international scene .
<2en> Aside from the successive and contradictory reports that are appearing , the truth is that Iran has not complied with its transparency obligation , nor has it helped to create a climate of confidence .
<2en> Quite the contrary .
<2en> Moreover , aside from the nuclear dossier , the news is not encouraging either .
<2en> Violations of human rights , state violence and sham electoral democracy are all factors to be taken into account in our attitude towards Iran .
<2en> Therefore , in the light of the above , but also on account of what I have stood for in the past , I agree with the essence of the adopted resolution , and emphasise the European Parliament 's insistence that the Council and the Commission comply with the European Court of Justice 's ruling by removing the Iranian resistance , the PMOI , from the list of terrorist organisations .
<2en> The EU ( and some Member States ) have been treating the Iranian resistance in a way that benefits the Iranian regime and neither the Iranian people nor the democratisation objectives for that part of the world .
<2en> That strategy has to change - and it is beginning to change .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) I am pleased at the way the Bali conference went , and that it produced unhoped-for results , partly thanks to the role played by the EU during the negotiations .
<en> In this tricky situation it was fundamentally important to give a signal of unity , cooperation and responsibility in a way that would get the negotiations to set new emission reduction targets for the post-Kyoto period ( 2012 ) off to a good start .
<en> By accepting the conclusions of scientists on the IPCC , all the participants recognised at the political level that climate change exists , that its origins are anthropogenic and that we need to act by 2020 to avoid irreparable damage to the Earth 's climate .
<en> I hope that Copenhagen in 2009 signals the turning point in the fight against climate change with the acceptance of stringent targets for reduction by 2020 by all industrialised and developing countries .
<en> Certainly , this new challenge will involve costs and inefficiencies that are difficult to justify unless , as I have already said in previous interventions , we make necessary and courageous choices such as the return to nuclear power .
<en> Inaction , procrastination and exhausting conferences will lead only to irreversible damage to the environment .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the outcome of the Bali Conference on Climate Change ( COP 13 and COP / MOP 3 ) because , in view of the urgency of reducing global warming , I believe that the agreement reached in Bali was an important step forward so that in 2009 , in Copenhagen , a new protocol can be drawn up and approved , with new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
<2en> I feel that the Portuguese EU Presidency played a key role in the Bali Conference , making an active contribution to the progress of the negotiations and managing to reach a very positive agreement .
<2en> It would be desirable , however , for the Bali Action Plan to refer to quantified targets for the reduction in CO2 emissions .

<en> in writing . - ( SV ) Unfortunately , once again the EU is using a humanitarian disaster to advance its position in the field of foreign policy .
<en> The June List expresses its sympathy with the civilian population affected by the conflict , but it is only through the UN that this conflict can be resolved , with broad international support , and not through the EU .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) While it is true that we share many of the concerns expressed in the resolution , it is also true that these fall well short of the necessary denunciation and condemnation of Israel 's colonialist policy with regard to Palestine and its people .
<en> Among other aspects :
<en> Once again , the resolution places the aggressor and aggressed , occupier and occupied on the same level , thereby ignoring the terrorism of the Israeli State ;
<en> The resolution does not condemn the criminal embargo imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip and its population nor does it denounce the connivance or silence of the United States of America or the European Union in this respect ;
<en> The resolution says nothing about the deplorable statements made by Commissioner Frattini who is responsible for justice and home affairs and who stated that the EU would be prepared to ' take on board Israeli concerns and interests in a way that was not on our agenda in the first years of intifada ' .
<en> It is at the very least abominable that someone who talks so much about terrorism not only ignores Israel 's terrorism but is prepared to cooperate with it .
<en> For our part , we continue to condemn Israel 's policy of apartheid against Palestine and to defend full compliance with the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people , enshrined in numerous UN resolutions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Gaza and am pleased that Parliament has taken such a strong stance on lifting the blockade .
<en> This is a humanitarian disaster in the making .
<en> There are insufficient drugs available in hospitals to provide basic care ; food assistance to part of the population only fulfils about two-thirds of daily requirements ; the fishing industry ( which employed about 10 000 people ) is under severe stress , as boats are only allowed to operate close to the coast .
<en> There is an ecological disaster under way , threatening the coastlines of the region , as the Beit Lahia plant sewage plant is not operating properly and repairs cannot be carried out , as supplies are blocked .
<en> Businesses cannot survive and the unemployed have to find work with the smugglers and extremists .
<en> The rocket attacks continue and the few involved in this threaten the peace and the future of the many - both Israeli and Palestinian .
<en> Hamas must stop the perpetrators .
<en> Only the extremists on all sides are benefiting , as I heard time and again on my recent visit to Gaza .
<en> The EU must do everything possible to break the blockade , and Israel must recognise that it is not giving them long-term security .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) Let 's be absolutely clear from the outset : the embargo by Israel is clearly a violation of international law and is completely unacceptable .
<en> As a result of the embargo and the denial of access to drinking water and food , Israel is artificially creating a situation for the people in the Gaza Strip which is without parallel in terms of its inhumanity and lack of concern for human dignity .
<en> It is thanks to the Egyptian Government and the cool head of the border police that a major disaster has so far been averted and people who are themselves not participants in the conflict have been given access to basic goods for their essential needs .
<en> What is irresponsible , on the other hand , is shifting the responsibility onto Egypt , which is completely blameless in terms of the escalation of the current situation .
<en> It is unacceptable , in the 21st century , for a civilian population to be treated as the scapegoat for terrorist acts by Hamas .
<en> The infrastructure must therefore be restored immediately and supplies to the local population guaranteed .
<en> The Palestinian side , for its part , should do its utmost to de-escalate the situation in order to facilitate the conclusion of an agreement by the end of 2008 .
<en> In the present situation , however , prospects of achieving this noble aspiration would appear to be remote .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - While every effort must be made to find a solution to the situation in Gaza , this resolution at best will contribute nothing and at worst will have a negative impact .
<en> If Parliament wants to be an honest broker for peace in the Middle East it should stop producing unbalanced resolutions .
<en> It is difficult for any member not to vote for a resolution addressing humanitarian concerns but by linking those concerns to an unfair portrayal of Israel its value falls .
<en> A parliamentary resolution should not call for Hamas to release a captive as a mere " act of goodwill ” .
<en> Hamas is not a benevolent medieval king ; it is a terrorist organisation largely responsible for the situation in Gaza .
<en> In demanding that Israel fulfils its obligations , this House should note that Israeli workers continue to risk their own lives to supply electricity to Gaza despite the manipulation of that electricity supply by Hamas .
<en> In addressing the needs of those who are suffering , we must include the people of southern Israel on whom some days an average of a rocket an hour has been fired and where 75 % of children are reported to be suffering from anxiety and post-traumatic stress .

<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague , Luciana Sbarbati , which is part of the consultation procedure on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a European Migration Network .
<en> The need to observe migratory flows dates back to the Commission 's first communication in 1994 and led in 2003 to the experimental creation of the European Migration Network ( EMN ) .
<en> In order to maintain this essential tool , it was becoming evident that a legal instrument needed to be established .
<en> In fact , despite the enormous volume of information produced on numerous aspects of international migration , these data are not easy to access .
<en> In addition , there is not enough reliable , comparable and up-to-date information or analyses of the development of the legal and political situation of immigration and asylum at both national and EU level .
<en> I support the initiatives aimed at widening this mechanism to include asylum and providing for an extension of the network 's mandate .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - British Conservatives abstained on this report since , whilst we disagree with its contents , the proposal acknowledges that the United Kingdom is exempt from the provisions .
<en> It is our long-standing policy not to take a position on issues which do not affect the United Kingdom and from which we have secured an opt-out .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the common European policies on migration and asylum have been constantly developing .
<en> In this context , it is vital that we can rely on objective , reliable and comparable information and data at national and European level so that we can better understand and analyse the migration phenomena and draw up policies or take decisions based on better information .
<en> However , the existing data is disparate and in many cases is not reliable , comparable or even up to date .
<en> The Thessaloniki European Council approved the establishment of a European Migration Network , which started to operate as a pilot project and was then followed by a preparatory action .
<en> I therefore support this proposal , which aims to consolidate the existing structure , making it permanent and giving it an appropriate legal basis by defining its objectives , functions , structure and methods of financing .
<en> I agree with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur , in particular the inclusion of asylum in the Network 's name and the extension of its mandate .
<en> I particularly agree that the Council 's proposal to only give Parliament a role as observer , without any right to vote , is unacceptable .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The proposed report is nothing more than a record of the failure of the various European policies implemented and bodies created to date .
<en> What exactly is its purpose ?
<en> Its purpose is to create yet another European structure , responsible for collecting , exchanging and using up-to-date data on migratory developments .
<en> It seems that a central information source is lacking .
<en> However , what about the activities of the dozens of other national , international and intergovernmental bodies , the European migration agency , the International Organisation for Migration and the Fundamental Rights Agency , which are responsible , in particular , for collecting information on migration ?
<en> What about Eurostat , Europol , the RAXEN network , Cirefi , etc . ?
<en> Are they ineffective , obsolete ?
<en> If the answer is ' yes ' , why do they get bigger budgets every year ?
<en> The rapporteur is rightly concerned about the risk of the European Migration Network duplicating the existing structures .
<en> He should , above all , be concerned about the dangerous drift of the European institutions , which , rather than solving the problems linked to immigration , is only masking the sad reality through a limitless increase in comitology practices and the creation of all sorts of bodies .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) The European Migration Network cannot continue operating without a clear legal basis .
<en> As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I fully support the report by Mrs Sbarbati proposing acceptance of the Commission 's proposal and the general agreement reached in the Council on the subject .
<en> I believe that the Council 's decision will provide an appropriate legal basis , on condition that it takes full account of the opinion of the European Parliament .
<en> The rapporteur 's proposal not to establish a new European monitoring centre for migratory flows is particularly worthy of support .
<en> The rapporteur suggests instead strengthening the existing system based on a network of National Contact Points .
<en> I also support the suggestion to increase the network 's competence to cover not only migration but also asylum .
<en> I believe the network 's information and research remit should be broadened to cover the production of studies , analyses and assessments concerning the application and implementation of directives .
<en> I consider that all of the network 's activity should be more useful so that the bodies involved in the decision-making process can make practical use of its work .
<en> It is good that the network will also be responsible for collecting and exchanging information on immigration and asylum .
<en> This will allow for the exchange and comparison of information , and make it possible to develop common criteria and indicators at European level in the future .

<en> The next item is the report by Mr Papayannakis , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation ( EC ) 820 / 97 , ( COM ( 1999 ) 487 - C5-0240 / 1999 - 1999 / 0204 ( COD ) ) .
<sp>
<2en> - ( EL ) Mr President , we all know that the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis , the mad cow crisis , is yet another crime which has not been punished , and I doubt it ever will .
<2en> But aside from this serious issue , it has left us with an institutional crisis , a market crisis , a drop in sales of beef products , a drop in prices and , most importantly , a consumer confidence crisis .
<2en> The regulation under discussion has come too late , much too late in my opinion , but all the same it will help to provide some answers , some solutions and it will help us to take some action to restore consumer confidence .
<2en> As you will recall , we fought a hard battle over this regulation last December in order to protect the rights of the European Parliament .
<2en> We also fought a battle to push through the implementation of the measures laid down in this regulation as swiftly as possible .
<2en> In short , we all know what we are talking about .
<2en> On the basis of this regulation , very soon , this year , all bovine animals will , by law , have to be identified and monitored right up to slaughter .
<2en> Meat from bovine animals will carry a label indicating the origin and history of the animals from which the meat is derived .
<2en> During our analysis of this regulation , we tried to cater for a great many demands and a great many opinions .
<2en> We wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as simple as possible so that they could be applied , and applied as quickly as possible .
<2en> Let us not forget that the system we are going to implement is an extremely complex , extremely technical system , and concerns approximately 100 million animals throughout the EU .
<2en> So we are talking about an extremely complex operation .
<2en> The system therefore needs to be simple and practicable and it needs to be comprehensible to the consumer ; this is of utmost importance to us .
<2en> Above all , it must not contain exceptions or what we call loopholes , i.e. ways in which the regulation can be contravened either through complex wording or because of local or special exceptions or applications .
<2en> I believe that we have managed to achieve this .
<2en> The system that Parliament is endeavouring to establish though its amendments could be applied from 1 September 2000 onwards and we insist on this because one demand of the entire House was that specific dates and deadlines should be set at long last and that we should get started .
<2en> I would just like to look at two amendments , two categories of amendments .
<2en> First , your rapporteur is calling , with the greatest respect , for a report , a Commission proposal , within the year , on the application of this system to meat products .
<2en> If we want to be taken seriously , we should also take account of consumer confidence in all meat products , of which , as we all know , there are a great many .
<2en> And secondly , some amendments deal with how permits are to be granted to enterprises , operators and so on to apply the labels , to label the meat .
<2en> The provisions recommended by the Commission are , to my mind , extremely minimal .
<2en> The interested party submits an application and , after a period of time , the system which he wishes to apply is applied .
<2en> I propose that we change this system .
<2en> Anyone labelling meat must have explicit approval from the competent public authorities .
<2en> This may seem a little more laborious , but we already have a laborious system and we must , at all costs , have state approval for meat labelling .
<2en> If not , then I am afraid that the system will become too lax and may even become corrupt , and , as a result , we will not achieve our main goal of winning consumer confidence in the system .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , as draftsman of the Committee on Agriculture , I should like to recapitulate a number of the committee ' s main causes for concern on this question .
<2en> The most important objective of the Commission proposal - and I should like expressly to stress this once again - is the traceability of beef or bovine animals from birth through to processing and sale .
<2en> This is one of the consequences of the BSE crisis and we must bear the objective of this proposal , i.e. traceability , in mind when debating what information should appear on the label .
<2en> We want labels which are practicable , simple , safe , cheap and easy to control .
<2en> Labels must be easy for consumers to understand , which is why the information needs to be kept to a minimum .
<2en> Consumers want information , not a novel .
<2en> Information on the fattening process and , where applicable , on antibiotics or other stimulants administered , as demanded in proposed Amendment No 48 , have absolutely no business to be on the label .
<2en> Information which does not come under compulsory labelling but which is requested by market participants or is already included on labels in the Member States can continue to be included within the framework of voluntary labelling .
<2en> This applies in particular to information on the region of origin of the meat .
<2en> As far as the entry into force of the regulation is concerned , we agree in principle with the Commission ' s approach that compulsory labelling should be introduced in two stages , but we do not agreed with the timetable insofar as we think that the date of 1 January 2003 has been put far too far back .
<2en> We shall have problems explaining this to consumers .
<2en> The Committee on Agriculture agreed on the wording " by 1 January 2002 at the latest " in a compromise on the introduction of compulsory information on origin , i.e. stage 2 .
<2en> Now the Committee on the Environment has opted for 1 September 2001 and I think that we can agree to this date .
<2en> It is only a matter of four months .
<2en> But we are emphatically against making all the information , including the indication of the place of birth , compulsory when the regulation enters into force in September 2000 , rather than in two stages .
<2en> That makes no sense , as the electronic database on which traceability depends is not yet up and running in the majority of Member States .
<2en> A compulsory labelling system for beef can only be as good as the system for registering bovine animals and all their movements .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , beef labelling has two distinct functions .
<en> Firstly , traceability in the case of a food safety incident - the recent E. coli outbreak in Scotland for example - and , secondly , to give consumers information about the origin of beef at the point of sale .
<en> The two should not be confused .
<en> For traceability we need maximum information made available to the authorities as and when required but the consumer label should be simple , concise and unambiguous .
<en> The need for information sprang from the BSE crisis .
<en> Member States have differing levels of BSE incidence but there are also variations in the measures to eradicate the disease and protect human health .
<en> Although the United Kingdom has the highest incidence of BSE , it also has the most comprehensive control measures .
<en> Other countries , which admittedly have lower declared levels of BSE , operate a whole-herd slaughter policy which entails the risk of the under-reporting of cases .
<en> Therefore people want to know which country their beef comes from .
<en> Reference to regions should not be an alternative to country of origin but a voluntary addition .
<en> Even regions like Yorkshire , Britain ' s premier region and coincidentally the region I represent , are not known by every citizen throughout the EU .
<en> From a marketing and promotional point of view smaller areas and localities could be used , as well as regional breeds such as Aberdeen Angus .
<en> The well established description of Scotch beef should continue to be used .
<en> Small traditional butcher shops that sell beef unpackaged should be allowed to display information as an alternative to labelling each item .
<en> Many consumers would be confused if given information about hanging or maturation , which could be mixed up with sell-by dates in their minds .
<en> I would draw attention particularly to Amendment No 41 which seeks to exclude farmers from Community aid schemes if the regulation is not strictly adhered to .
<en> I have already had cases drawn to my attention regarding other EU schemes where honest errors by farmers , who are not professional bureaucrats , have resulted in punitive sanctions which often threaten the future of a family farm .
<en> We should not go down this road .
<en> The listing of antibiotics and stimulants that might have been administered would , if adopted , create a two-tier beef market .
<en> Animal welfare would be compromised as farmers would be reluctant to treat animals therapeutically .
<en> Similarly , reference to fattening methods should not be introduced .
<en> I hope that in amending this regulation Parliament can for once simplify rather than embellish and make the labelling of beef consumer- , butcher- and farmer-friendly .

<en> Mr President , my group welcomed the report by Mr Papayannakis and salutes him for his persistence .
<en> I say that because he comes from a small political group - and it is often hard to make headway here - and he comes from one of the southern Member States , which will in some ways have to make sacrifices and introduce regulations to bring about effective , proper beef labelling throughout the Community .
<en> He has also had to face the obfuscation and delays brought about by the Council .
<en> The fact that we have had to wait two years for this proposal to become a practical reality is a poor comment on the urgency with which they regard it , although the situation was plainly critical from the time of the outbreak of the BSE crisis onwards .
<en> However , we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead .
<en> This is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay .
<en> Parliament has the opportunity , if it is willing to grasp it , to set a realistic timetable for the two-tier implementation of a comprehensive process of labelling for beef and for beef products .
<en> In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , we supported most of the amendments from the rapporteur and others and we do so again today .
<en> We do that on the basis that the key proposal plainly has to be the issue of timing .
<en> Some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave .
<en> We are now talking about implementation of the first stage in September 2000 and the second stage in September 2001 .
<en> I was glad to hear the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development say that they would settle for the four-month advance that would involve coming forward from January 2002 .
<en> We believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole European Union on the move .
<en> That is why we want the second stage as set out in Article 13 ( 5 ) to be distinct and a commensurate advance .
<en> Why do we want that ?
<en> There are some here - certainly some from Member States that have very effective traceability and labelling possibilities already - who would like to do the whole thing at once .
<en> They would be able to say to others : look - you cannot do it , you are at fault .
<en> Our job is to bring all 15 Member States together so that the process of traceability throughout the whole of the food chain , from the birth of the animal to its slaughter and disposal , would be universally applied throughout the European Union .
<en> We say to those who are resistant to this : please remember that it is necessary to bring everybody on board .
<en> What everybody wants - whether they are farmers , citizens or consumers in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the Union - is to feel that they have equal confidence , wherever they are , in the safety of the product that they are consuming .
<en> We have struck out the second subparagraph of Article 13 ( 5 ) and all other amendments which follow the same line of allowing imprecise mixed origins or an indication such as " EU origin " .
<en> One day " EU origin " may be assurance enough but it is not at this moment .
<en> We need to know from which state a product has arrived .
<en> I know that there are people in the Netherlands who disagree with that and I would be interested to know why .
<en> I cannot see that " EU origin " is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal .
<en> We are also opposed to the derogation for minced beef , which might apply to something like 30 % of the beef output , which ought to be open to labelling .
<en> Minced beef is as much , if not more , at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources .
<en> It is the case in my country that we have seen minced beef and lamb and other meats mixed up together .
<en> We need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else .
<en> We agree with the rapporteur ' s intention to stiffen and speed up the compliance provisions in Amendments Nos 42 and 43 .
<en> We also agree that supplementary information should and can be provided for those Member States that need it and for those special regions which have important information to communicate .
<en> My last point is to end where I began .
<en> My country , Mr President , and yours - if I can call Scotland my country too , as I certainly would - have suffered the horrors of BSE .
<en> We know we bore a large part of the responsibility for it .
<en> It was incumbent upon us to make special provisions by way of food safety as a result .
<en> After our years of effort to that end , we can now justifiably say to the Community as a whole that what we want for ourselves we want for everyone else as well .

<en> They constitute a serious problem but bureaucratic efforts have not curtailed the activities of dealers who sell drugs at schools , centres of higher education , housing estates and other public places , and it is unlikely that they will do so in the future .
<en> In 1998 a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations set itself the goal of creating a drug-free world in the course of 10 years .
<en> Subsequent years saw the publication of many recommendations , regulations , decisions , reports and a Green Paper .
<en> We have today voted on yet another draft resolution .
<en> We would do well to reflect on what all this has achieved .
<en> I am sorry to have to say that never in the history of mankind have drugs been as easily obtainable as they now are .
<en> All that remains is for it to be possible to order them through the Internet .
<en> I voted in favour of the resolution because I support any measure to combat drugs .
<en> Nonetheless , I should like to point out that until we isolate producers from distributors and introduce radical changes to the penal code to create an effective deterrent for people who make a living out of drugs , this problem will not be reduced .
<en> On the contrary , it will increase in magnitude .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) I believe that it is necessary , not just at European level but also nationally and locally , to promote a dialogue with and between the various civil society stakeholders so as to avert the terrible dangers represented by drugs .
<en> Civil society must be regarded as a key ally of the Union and the Member States in achieving the goals set out in the EU drugs strategy .
<en> Indeed , thanks to their experience in the field , therapeutic communities can support awareness-raising campaigns by providing more and better information about the risks inherent in drug abuse and about possible prevention programmes .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) No one questions the importance of the enormous , often successful work carried out by civil organisations to help people who have become dependent on drugs .
<en> We need to gather together all the forces for good in the battle against harmful , addictive substances .
<en> It was therefore gratifying to see a report which highlights the initiatives being carried out in Europe .
<en> The reason why I abstained from voting today thus has nothing to do with the actual subject of the report .
<en> Instead the reason can be read under the heading ' Civil society - the external dimension ' .
<en> Some time ago , an agonising decision , I have to admit , I voted in favour of a report which supported facilitating a switch to legal poppy cultivation in Afghanistan , with production being used in pain-relieving drugs .
<en> One of the reasons for this was the number of reports which had appeared on the negative consequences of spraying the existing crops using planes and the desperate situation of the Afghan people .
<en> The report encourages both separate cultivation and spraying , which is inconsistent .
<en> The report also grants support to organisations in Europe working to produce substances derived from coca leaves , for example , for therapeutic or other ' lawful use ' .
<en> I am strongly against this .
<en> As the main intention of the report is nevertheless good , I finally chose to abstain .

<en> In order to help protect children effectively , I am working on a European campaign called ' Do you know where your child is now ? ' .
<en> The chapter of this resolution dealing with organ trafficking is directly linked to it .
<en> The call to Member States and to the Council to adopt effective measures to sever the links between the lack of organs and organ trafficking is therefore more than justified .
<en> In order to combat organ trafficking , a long-term strategy must be adopted with a view to eliminating the social inequalities at the root of such practices .
<en> We must combat trafficking in organs and tissues , which should be universally banned , in particular where it concerns the transplantation of organs and tissues from minors .
<en> I am deeply disappointed that Europol has not carried out a survey of organ selling and trafficking , citing the absence of documented cases .
<en> On the contrary , reports by the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation clearly prove that organ trafficking is a problem in Member States of the Union , too .
<en> We ask the European Commission and Europol to improve the monitoring of organ trafficking and draw the necessary conclusions .
<en> I hope that Slovakia can make use of its EU Presidency to move this very important agenda forward .

<en> That adjustment had become unavoidable because of the delay in adopting certain operational programmes under headings 1B and 2 , EUR 2 034 million at current prices of the appropriations set aside for the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Funds , rural development and the European Fisheries Fund which could not be committed in 2007 or carried forward to 2008 .

<en> It should be noted that the provisions affected by the proposal expired on 31 December 2006 .
<en> The proposal concerning the establishment of tariff-free quotas and the provisions for managing the latter complies with Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union , which provides for specific measures to assist the outermost regions .
<en> I therefore voted in favour of this report , as I consider that the exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of certain fishery products , which are essential for domestic consumption , entails additional costs for this sector .
<en> One way of remedying natural difficulties of this type , due to geographical location , is to temporarily suspend duties on imports of the products in question from third countries .

<en> As a member of the European Parliament 's Committee on Petitions , I have seen for myself that an enormous , and growing , number of citizens are turning to the Community institutions to appeal against the failure of Member States to comply with EU rules .
<en> Very often the petitions submitted to Parliament , and examined by the committee responsible , cannot be deemed admissible .
<en> Here I would take up one key point : the office of the European Ombudsman must work harder and better on its external communications with citizens .
<en> Very often the ordinary person is unaware even of the existence of the Ombudsman , potentially a means of creating a more functional and efficient link with the EU institutions .
<en> The statute on which we are voting today sets out new mechanisms to bolster the effectiveness of the Ombudsman 's work .

<sp>

<en> According to the text the various bodies and institutions of the European Union must supply the Ombudsman with all the information asked for , whereas until now a document could be refused on the pretext of confidentiality .
<en> Similarly , the obligation on officials to provide testimony ' pursuant to instructions from their administrations ' is to be removed , while the official in question is to be required to tell the truth in all honesty .

<2en> The high price of oil is making us all suffer , but the most vulnerable population groups on low incomes are certainly being badly hit .
<2en> The European summit must send out a strong signal tomorrow that measures for the weakest in society really are justified and necessary .
<2en> A reduction in VAT or excise duty is not an immediately obvious solution , which is understandable , as it might encourage the oil producers to charge even higher prices .
<2en> Perhaps , however , we could do it differently .
<2en> Perhaps we should go for a shift in duties , so that air tickets specifically are made a bit more expensive ( from the autumn for instance ) , by means of a levy , and the proceeds of that are used to reduce heating bills for people on low and middle incomes .
<2en> Any surplus revenue could be used to provide grants for insulating homes .
<2en> That is the cheapest and most efficient solution , all things considered .
<2en> Investing in renewable energy and energy-saving is what we have to do , certainly over the medium term .

<en> For the moment , practical and tangible steps must be taken to ease the pressure on groups such as farmers , fishermen and members of society who are most vulnerable to these price increases .

<en> in writing . - ( PT ) We voted against this report because its central objective is to weaken the democratic and pluralistic functioning of the European Parliament .
<en> Starting from a principle that is not even true - the existence of the Reform Treaty - a majority of this House actually want to reduce the rights of Members and prevent them from acting on their own initiative , increase the power of the President of the European Parliament and , as a result , reduce the pluralism of parliamentary debate .
<en> This desire to weaken democracy and Members ' capacity to act is also clear in the establishment of guidelines on the procedure for written questions put to the Council and the Commission .
<en> However , this decision is only one element in the more general anti-democratic line taken by a majority of this House , particularly among the larger political groups ( PPE and PSE ) .
<en> Another fundamental element is the demand for new and more restrictive criteria on the formation of political groups which also merits our rejection and strong protest .

<2en> As a democrat I am particularly struck by two amendments relating to the Corbett report , for I do not think these could have been meant seriously .
<2en> It is part of the democratic rights of a member of parliament in practically every country that is democratic in character to be able to question the elected rulers on their jurisdiction and responsibilities .
<2en> Restricting the number and content of these questions notionally derives more from the procedures of a court hearing than from the rules of a democratically legitimate institution and the proposal should therefore be totally rejected .

<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Jutta Haug on the first reflections on the preliminary draft budget ( PDB ) and mandate for the conciliation , which provides a framework for reflection on the structure of the EU 's future budget .
<en> The PDB totals EUR 134 395 billion in commitment appropriations , which corresponds to 1.04 % of GNI , an increase of 3.1 % compared with 2008 , and EUR 116.7 billion in payment appropriations , leaving a margin of EUR 2.6 billion under commitments and EUR 7.4 billion under payments .
<en> Given the need for a Europe of results , I cannot understand the low level of payment appropriations .
<en> In addition to the priorities , it will be important to ensure that adequate funds are allocated to the cohesion policy , the financing of the European policy for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , and external action .
<en> Finally , it will be crucial not to forget the major European infrastructures ( transport networks , energy , space , water , new technologies , health , etc . ) , which are regularly under-financed despite the fact that they form the backbone of Europe 's competitiveness within the framework of global economic and social competition .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) According to the planned ratification timetable for the Lisbon Treaty , in 2009 Parliament and the Council would have equal rights as regards the creation of laws as well as in budgetary matters , on the way to giving the European Union new powers and making fundamental changes in the budgetary procedure used to date .
<en> For this reason it is even more important for the European Union to have the financial resources required to implement current policies and activities in different areas , while at the same time having sufficient flexibility to deal with new political challenges .
<en> For this reason the unusually low level of funds proposed for payments in the initial draft budget ( EUR 116 736 billion ) , which is 0.90 % of GNP , or a decrease of 3.3 % in relation to 2008 , is very surprising .
<en> Also worrying are the budget decreases proposed by the European Commission for information campaigns that were planned a long time ago for 2009 , for the European Parliament elections or for the possible entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> The priority for the July conciliation meeting on the budget should be to ensure an appropriate level of funds for payments and for the Union 's information policy .
<en> It is also vital to present the Commission with funding proposals for pilot projects and preparatory works , in order to avoid financing them from the reserves of multi-annual financial frameworks .

<en> Given the policy of free movement of people within the EU , the actions of one European country may have repercussions for others at a time when we already face complex terrorist problems .

<sp>
<2en> We voted in favour of the European Parliament 's joint motion for a resolution on the possibility of receiving Guantánamo inmates who have not been charged with offences , since we believe that EU cooperation is essential to reinforce international law and respect for human rights , and to ensure that Guantánamo inmates receive fair , impartial treatment .
<2en> We therefore regard the Portuguese Government 's initiative and willingness to collaborate with the US Administration in the process of closing the Guantánamo detention facility as an example to be followed by other Member States , in order to support the United States in resolving this complex problem within a framework of respect for human rights and the rules of international law .

<en> In fact , we should not under any circumstances agree to EU Member States accepting detainees believed to be ' potential threats ' ( recital D ) ; nor should we forget the precedent of the 61 former inmates who have been involved in terrorism since their release ( recital F ) .

<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the European Commission is deeply concerned - like you - by the Sudanese decision to expel 13 international , as well as to suspend three national , humanitarian NGOs and two national human rights NGOs , following the ICC indictment of President Bashir .
<en> Six of these international NGOs operate with EC humanitarian funding amounting to a total of EUR 10 million .
<en> Those organisations provide essential services to millions of Sudanese in Darfur and in other areas of Sudan .
<en> The suspension of their activities is , therefore , not only highly regrettable but will also seriously affect the humanitarian situation , as many of you have said .
<en> In a statement , Commissioner Michel has already expressed our deepest concern and urged ' the Government of Sudan to reconsider the value of their decision and to urgently restore these NGOs to their full operational status ' .
<en> If the full impact of the Sudanese decision is still being assessed , it is clear that the lives of hundreds of thousands of people might be at risk in Darfur .
<en> Appropriate measures need to be taken urgently , as the approaching rainy season and the yearly hunger gap will soon exacerbate the humanitarian vulnerability of the 4.7 million people directly affected by the conflict .
<en> We know that the Government is not going to reverse its decision under further international pressure calling into question its decision to expel the NGOs in question .
<en> If we cannot persuade the Government to reverse the expulsion orders , we have to engage the Sudanese authorities in order to put in place the appropriate delivery mechanisms .
<en> In this respect , we must certainly hold the Sudanese Government fully accountable for its assurances that it takes full responsibility for delivering humanitarian aid .
<en> It is also our duty to take the necessary contingency measures with respect to our assistance .
<en> Sudan is the Commission 's single largest humanitarian operation : EUR 110 million in 2009 .
<en> The Commission , together with other donors , like the United Nations and the NGOs and other humanitarian partners , is currently looking into how best to redesign the humanitarian response in order to avoid dramatic consequences .
<en> It is not an easy task , as the expelled NGOs were among those very capable of working in such difficult and remote areas .
<en> These contingency measures will clearly require some cooperation and agreement with the Sudanese authorities .
<en> In this respect , it is essential to insist on strict separation between the humanitarian activities and the political agenda .
<en> On the political front , we will have to maintain maximum diplomatic pressure on the Sudanese authorities and the rebel movements alike to reach peace in Darfur .
<en> We will also have to press for the full implementation of the North-South Comprehensive Peace Agreement .
<en> The stakes are very high , and it is our responsibility not to let Sudan be engulfed in a nightmare scenario of country-wide instability .
<en> The EU as a whole will respect the ICC 's guidelines and maintain only essential contacts with Sudanese President Bashir .
<en> However - and here it is crucial that , as I said before , we maintain dialogue with Khartoum - we should ensure that the Government 's reaction to the ICC indictment is as restrained as possible .
<en> If we cut off all relations , the hardliners among the Government may retaliate against civilians , humanitarian workers and UNMIS personnel .
<en> The recent decision to expel several NGOs is , we think , the first step , which could be followed by many more situations like the present one , and we have to monitor that carefully .
<en> A worst-case scenario of a halt in the implementation of the CPA and an attempt by the Government to find a military solution to the Darfur crisis must be avoided .

<en> CRAs should not be seen as a scapegoat , given that equally at fault were the banking and regulatory culture that relegated risk strategies to the back rooms .
<en> We hope that the EU , the United States and the CRAs can work together to create a system that operates properly .
<en> For this to happen , a heavy-handed regulatory approach needs to give way to one that accepts the element of risk in all investments and which allows a degree of acceptance of ratings undertaken outside the scope of what we have today voted .

<en> Council ( EC ) Regulations No 11 / 98 and No 12 / 98 led to the creation of the single market for the international carriage of passengers by bus and coach .
<en> This liberalisation has contributed to the steady increase in the volume of traffic relating to the sector , which , has undergone continuous growth from the mid-1990s to today .
<en> This positive trend , however , has not been accompanied by the protection and upholding of passengers ' rights : passengers have pointed out many problems , including cancellations , overbooking , loss of luggage and delays .
<en> Unlike passengers who choose other modes of transport , bus and coach users remain unprotected because of a gap in Community legislation .
<en> I therefore welcome the proposal of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , which seeks to establish their rights by means of the document on which we are about to vote .
<en> In particular , the proposal is especially interesting since it holds carriers liable in the event of death or injury , introduces compensation and assistance in the event of cancellations and delays , recognises the rights of people with reduced mobility or other disabilities and establishes bodies responsible for overseeing this regulation and handling complaints .

<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Thank you , Madam President .
<en> I voted for the report .
<en> The core subject-matter of Regulation ( EC ) No 2560 / 2001 is cross-border transfers and cross-border electronic payment operations .
<en> The regulation was adopted on 19 December 2001 and its aim is to ensure that the cost of a cross-border payment is the same as a payment made within a Member State .
<en> Up until 1 January 2006 , it applied only to transfers , withdrawals from automatic teller machines and to payments made with a debit or credit card up to EUR 12 500 in EU countries , whereas , from that date , the amount has been increased to EUR 50 000 .
<en> This change has led to a fall in prices and greater competition on the payment services markets .
<en> Regulation ( EC ) No 2560 / 2001 also has drawbacks , however , such as the failure to define ' corresponding payments ' and the failure to include a review clause , and it is necessary to take action on these points immediately .
<en> I would like to conclude by saying that we are in favour of the proposals to update and amend Regulation ( EC ) No 2560 / 2001 , since it is our duty to make cross-border payment transactions easier and more economical .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the Schnellhardt report on the regulation laying down health rules as regards animal by-products not intended for human consumption , as I consider that the proposals contained in this document will substantially improve the safety of these products , particularly by ensuring traceability throughout the treatment process .
<2en> Food safety and consumer protection in the EU will thus be reinforced .
<sp>
<2en> This report will enable the European Union to equip itself with a more precise legislative framework with which to increase the level of safety throughout the food production and distribution chain .
<2en> The merits of this text are that it proposes a method that is based more on risks and controls , and makes the regulations on animal by-products and the legislation on hygiene more consistent , while also introducing additional rules on the traceability of animal by-products .
<2en> I can also tell you that Mr Schnellhardt 's previous report on the hygiene of foodstuffs ( 2002 ) had a very positive impact by making the European game sector aware of its responsibilities .
<2en> The transposition of this regulation into national law has had positive effects on the ground , including by improving the training of seven million European hunters , who , as a result of working in that environment all the time , are in a position quickly and effectively to detect health crises affecting wild fauna .
<2en> I therefore support this report , which will enable the European Union to better anticipate and react to any potential food crises linked to products of animal origin .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report because in Romania as well as in other Member States we are sometimes faced with crises which affect public and animal health safety in relation to animal products , such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy , dioxin , swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease .
<2en> Such crises can also have a wider adverse impact on the socio-economic situation of farmers and the industrial sectors affected , including a decline in consumer confidence in the safety of animal products .
<2en> Disease outbreaks can also have adverse consequences for the environment : disposal of the bodies and biodiversity .
<2en> We needed to review the regulation on animal by-products ( ABP ) not intended for human consumption from a legislative perspective .
<2en> This will therefore resolve problems linked to differences in interpretation of the scope of the regulation and the problems caused by this , such as : distortion of competition and the different levels of protection against the risks to public and animal health ; ABP classification based to a larger extent on risks ; clarification of derogations ( e.g. impact of ABPs on research , disease outbreaks , natural disasters ) ; reduction in the administrative burden by eliminating the duplication of permits for certain types of economic units .
<2en> The review upholds the principles used to regulate in the EU the use , processing , disposal , traceability and allocation of ABPs not intended for human consumption , thereby ensuring a high level of food safety and consumer protection .
<sp>
<2en> This report concerns the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2003 / 48 / EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments .
<2en> I voted for this report on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments , because it reinforces the principles of transparency and fiscal justice .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I wish to thank the Commissioner for that very full answer and , in particular , for the last part where he indicates that the Commission is looking at speeding up and , where possible , giving fast-track approval for state aids .
<en> However , in some Member States there is still a serious problem created by delays in decision-taking on state aids .
<en> I am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time .
<en> In terms of the delay , is the Commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids , or does the problem lie , as he partly indicated , with the Member States in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application ?
<sp>
<en> As you know , Mr Martin , we are working in a number of directions concerning state aid and in order to make state aid control more stringent .
<en> As to time limits , there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future .
<en> The deadlines are laid down in a Council regulation , which for the first time codifies state aid procedures , and since that regulation was only adopted in 1999 it is not likely to be modified in the near future .
<en> However , we are prepared and indeed willing to try to speed up certain aspects of the decision-making wherever possible , for example preparing the standard notification forms .
<en> You mentioned the problem of resources .
<en> Of course , this is a key problem for the whole of the competition policy activities and that includes state aid .
<en> The better the quality of information provided to begin with by Member States in their notifications , the more likely it is that the process will be smooth and conducted in a relatively short time scale .
<sp>
<en> Question No 44 by ( H-0355 / 00 ) :
<en> Subject : State aids to nuclear power Given that the electricity market came into effect in February last , subjecting all electricity production to the rules of the internal market , and that the nuclear common market under Article 92 of the Euratom Treaty does not include electricity as a product , does the Commission agree that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity ?
<en> Does the Commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are prohibited by the EC Treaty , given that no derogation is specified , and that Article 98 of the Euratom Treaty does not provide for a subsidised accident insurance scheme for nuclear risks ?
<en> In this context what proposals , if any , has the Commission made to the UK Government concerning their NFFO system under Article 87 of the EC Treaty ?
<en> Can the Commission now confirm that it is investigating state aids to the nuclear industry as requested by the Green / EFA Group in its letter to Commissioner Monti of 10 March ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the Commission shares the opinion of the honourable Member to the effect that the liberalisation of the electricity market affects all types of electricity , including electricity generated using nuclear energy .
<2en> The Commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the EC or the Euratom Treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry .
<2en> The Euratom Treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid .
<2en> Moreover , while Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids , they also authorise specific categories of state aid .
<2en> It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case .
<2en> The Commission has not made any proposals to the UK Government on the subject of the NFFO system in application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty .
<2en> As regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry , the Commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation .
<2en> If , however , cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the Commission , such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the EC and Euratom Treaties .
<sp>
<2en> Commissioner , thank you for your response , but I must admit I find it hard to grasp the logic of it .
<2en> On the one hand , regarding state aid to the environment , you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that , for the time being , this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs .
<2en> In other words , the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 5 % .
<2en> Alongside that , nuclear energy amounts to 30 % of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation .
<2en> I do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this , if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair , treating all forms of electricity production alike .
<2en> I must therefore ask you to justify your position since , as far as I am concerned , and also many others , most especially the renewable energy industry , it is a position which is extremely difficult to comprehend .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> We will forward the request .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<2en> The European Union telecoms legislative framework arose in the 1990s , and was intended to liberalise domestic markets dominated by state monopolies .
<2en> In the meantime we have witnessed revolutionary technological changes in the development of mobile telephony and the Internet .
<2en> The draft reforms to legislation regulating the telecommunications market in the EU , which Parliament will be voting on tomorrow , are intended to adapt EU law to these changes , for example by improving the position of users in the market for electronic services .
<2en> My personal view is that Internet access is a significant factor which supports the education process , and it shows that people are able to use their freedom of speech and have access to information and the job market .
<2en> Internet users must not be denied access to the Internet or have their access restricted without the prior ruling of a competent judiciary body .
<2en> This is why I feel very strongly that we should restore the two most important amendments , numbers 138 and 166 , which were adopted by Parliament at first reading in September 2008 .
<2en> These amendments would restore the guarantee of users ' rights , place the obligation of monitoring on domestic regulators and make illegal the arbitrary blocking and discretionary restriction of citizens ' access to applications , services and content published on the Internet .
<2en> In the form in which they have been submitted for second reading on 6 May , both amendments , which have apparently only been modified but in fact have been significantly changed , are a serious threat to freedom of expression , freedom of access to the Internet and the right to information - pillars of modern , democratic , civic societies .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( ET ) The new rules presented in the new telecommunications package will help regulate the telecommunications market and promote consumer protection .
<en> It will be significantly easier for consumers to obtain information from their service provider and change service providers .
<en> Precontract information must indicate whether a consumer is tied to a contract for a specific period of time .
<en> In addition , service providers cannot hold on to customers for longer than 24 months .
<en> The moving of a telephone number from one service provider to another must be done within one working day .
<en> The transparency of the provision of services has improved , and consumers are able to compare prices on web pages , and local operators can be obligated to provide services to handicapped people .
<en> Consumers can ask for a maximum price level to be set , once their monthly consumption reaches a certain level .
<en> If a service provider inadvertently divulges an individual 's personal information on the Internet , they must properly notify the person of that fact .
<en> The new rules will also help regulate the telecommunications market and ease the arrival of new services onto the market .
<en> The coordination of the radio spectrum in the EU creates an opportunity for the provision of completely new services , and removes the obstructions that have existed until now , for instance on the viewing of television programmes on mobile phones .
<en> The rights of state regulators have been increased , and a new EU regulator has been created , with the objective of strengthening independent market supervision , which will definitely benefit consumers .
<en> Thank you .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I am absolutely delighted that this report has been adopted by such an overwhelming majority and we can look forward to a ban on the import of seal products into the European Union .
<en> I must say that I was saddened to see that our rapporteur , the Liberal Democrat Diana Wallis , was not fully in favour of this course of action .
<en> As rapporteur , she should have represented the views of the committee , where there was a very clear majority , and not sought in a number of ways to overturn what was clearly the will of a very large majority in this House .
<en> Nonetheless , I am glad that Parliament has shown such clear determination by such a clear majority to settle the issue in the way that we have now decided .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this report presented me with something of a dilemma .
<en> There is something not strictly rational about singling out seals for special treatment .
<en> They are not an endangered species - even the WWF says so .
<en> We do not get anything like the clamour about hunting seals on behalf of wasps or woodlice or wolverines or worms .
<en> Then again , democracy is not strictly rational .
<en> People are not always calculating machines .
<en> It may be , as evolutionary biologists would argue , that it is the childlike features of the baby seal - its large eyes and so on - that on a deep genetic level give us a predisposition towards empathy with them .
<en> I do not know .
<en> The point is that you open a dangerous door if you say that the voters are wrong simply because their objection to seal hunting is aesthetic rather than rational or ethical .
<en> Once you have started down that road , it is a short step to saying that they are wrong to be against the European Constitution or the Lisbon Treaty or whatever .
<en> So , after a lot of thinking , I have reached this view about this report : because it is obviously such a sensitive and important issue for a number of our voters , it should not be decided at EU level at all , but should rather be determined properly through the national , democratic mechanisms and procedures of every Member State .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I rise with pride that this House voted for this report with an overwhelming majority .
<en> I voted for this report because I am pleased that we are making a strong statement , without loopholes , on the trade in seal products in the EU .
<en> Many people in my constituency contacted us - and millions have got involved in this - to say that this was the most disgusting and cruelly-deployed killing of lovely creatures .
<en> I know some may say this is just because they are attractive , but when one sees videos of the methods used one realises that commercial seal slaughter , in particular , is unnecessary because many alternatives are available .
<en> I am very pleased that we have voted in such large numbers to stop this cruel trade .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this ban is great progress and represents a true victory for campaigners across the South East of England particularly - as you could imagine - and across the European Union , many of whom have written to us in the House to demand the end of this cruel trade .
<en> The fact that a Labour chair of committee led this campaign , in the face of intense lobbying by the perpetrators of this cruel and obscene trade , is crucial in realising its success .
<en> It was not the watered-down original - as my colleague , Richard Corbett pointed out - but , after critical amendments were proposed by Arlene McCarthy , the ban was voted through in the committee and now in Parliament .
<en> I was intrigued just now to hear Mr Hannan from the Conservative Party suggesting this should be a matter of national discussion and democracy .
<en> If we were to rely upon that particular route , only eight countries would be signing up to this particular ban , as opposed to the 27 by voting it through the European Parliament .
<en> It shows that trade and animal welfare are compatible and we should rejoice in that .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , ( ... ) the Wallis report represents a step forward for the general protection of animal rights because it greatly limits the import of seal products into the Union .
<en> The Union has made a civilised choice in this context and we hope other countries will follow , even though we would have preferred the Commission text to have been the one submitted on the internal market , which very clearly limited possible exceptions to the sale of such products to cases dependent on the subsistence needs of the Inuit people .
<en> Unless they are properly controlled by border customs authorities , new exceptions could open up dangerous loopholes that will make it possible to evade the measure that , after a long struggle , punishes the futility and cruelty of certain of Man 's practices that should no longer be allowed to offend our consciences .
<en> I hope that today 's step forward does not stand in isolation , that more effort may be put into reconsidering ways of preventing our countries importing products derived from animals that have been killed with incredible suffering .
<en> On this subject , I also remind you of the great vileness of continuing to support the practice , in Europe , of butchering animals without stunning them and letting them bleed to death .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Personally , I find it regrettable that the committee 's proposals , which were very clear , have not been adopted by the groups .
<2en> Species conservation - especially faced with the known conditions of slaughter - demands decisive measures without compromise .
<2en> The jobs related to this business can easily be reoriented .
<sp>
<2en> The decision of the European Parliament to ban the trade in seal products in the European Community is a step in the direction of bringing an end to the brutal methods used by some countries to cull these animals .
<2en> The draft resolution is a response to the concerns of public opinion over issues of animal welfare during the culling and skinning of seals .
<2en> The text of the regulation allows for several exceptions which in some cases are necessary .
<2en> In particular this includes an exemption from the ban to allow seal products which are obtained by Inuit communities using traditional hunting methods as a means to ensure their subsistence .
<2en> I am glad that the European Parliament has declared its support for adoption of this regulation by such a clear majority .
<2en> It is a very clear signal on the part of the European institutions that the citizens of Europe do not agree to the brutal treatment and killing of animals .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We understand and share concerns about the trade in seal products .
<en> We have no problem with individual states banning seal products , but we believe that this should be a matter for individual states and not for the Commission .
<en> Therefore , we have been unable to support this proposal .
<sp>
<2en> In the current term the European Parliament has devoted a relatively large amount of attention to the protection of animals .
<2en> The introduction of a ban on the trade in certain seal products in the European Union undoubtedly strengthens that protection .
<2en> It is also a source of satisfaction to the 425 MEPs who signed the written declaration on this subject .
<2en> It should also be noted that in its resolution Parliament has expressed its desire to respect the culture and traditions of indigenous peoples .
<2en> The way in which measures to protect seals develop in the future will depend on many factors in the international context and the WTO .
<2en> Nonetheless , this initiative of MEPs deserves approval and support .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am pleased today that we voted to ban the EU trade in seal products .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I take issue with amendment 2 , which criticized the Roman Catholic Church and its leader Pope Benedict for his views on the use of condoms , but wisely the House rejected this amendment .
<en> There is little evidence that promoting the use of condoms actually prevents the transmission of AIDS .
<en> Pope Benedict is entitled to his views as his own human right , whether or not others agree with them .
<en> I wonder whether this report would have dared to criticize a leader of another major world religion in the same hostile way .
<en> It is the role of the Roman Catholic Church to lead the faithful , not to be led .
<en> We should accord more respect to a Church and a religion on which the values of our Union are founded .
<en> British Conservative MEPs support high standards of human rights in the world , but overall abstained on the report in the final vote as it included issues like ' Reproductory Rights ' - which effectively mean abortion - and the death sentence , which are individual conscience matters , as well as advocating policy areas like the ICC , and the Lisbon Treaty , which we have a party position opposing .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am the strongest supporter of genuine human rights and therefore have no difficulty with many aspects of this report .
<en> I was personally responsible for introducing a paragraph asking the Council and Member States to take more effective action over the human rights catastrophe caused by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe .
<en> However , the report consistently and unaccountably refers to the EU as if it were a sovereign state - references that I and other Members attempted unsuccessfully to remove at the committee stage .
<en> The idea that individual Member States should surrender their national prerogative on matters of human rights to the European Union , whether in the forum of the United Nations or elsewhere , is totally unacceptable .
<en> I also object to the gratuitous and unnecessary references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which Conservatives and many others have consistently opposed .
<en> I therefore abstained on the final vote on the report .
<sp>
<2en> Articles 84 and 96 of the report deal with the human rights situation in Cuba .
<2en> It must be said that , despite international pressure , systematic intimidation , interrogation and sophisticated forms of violence have continued against the Women in White even in 2008 .
<2en> Several weeks ago the regime attempted in all manner of ways to prevent them from mounting a silent protest on the sixth anniversary of their husbands ' imprisonment .
<2en> As a mark of support , a solidarity march for the Women in White and their husbands was held in Bratislava on 28 April 2009 .
<2en> Of the 75 activists imprisoned six years ago , whose cause has been backed by organisations including the EU , 54 remain behind bars .
<2en> Only if we monitor their plight will we succeed in getting them out of prison before they are reduced to human wrecks .
<2en> Let us not forget that we will soon be commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
<2en> What we can do for the Cuban prisoners and their wives now is to leave the paragraphs on human rights ' violations in Cuba in the text of the report .
<2en> I feel I have to mention Amendment 2 , which sharply criticises Pope Benedict XVI .
<2en> This amendment maligns the head of the Catholic Church .
<2en> Besides that , it places his statements on the same level as crimes committed in countries where the death penalty is abused , where people are tortured and killed for expressing their opinions and where there is no respect for the most basic human rights .
<2en> Let us reject this amendment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - UK Conservatives believe that , while cross-border cooperation in criminal justice is important , the report seeks to create a common justice area at an EU level , which would significantly compromise the traditions of those countries which base their legal system on common law .
<en> Therefore , we cannot support this proposal .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Criminal justice is rightly the responsibility of EU Member States .
<en> I can accept that Member States need to cooperate in trans-national matters related to criminal justice but I do not accept the development of an EU criminal justice area .
<en> Extending the EU 's so-called ' competence ' into criminal justice would be an unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into British sovereignty .
<en> People in my region of North-East England want criminal law to be made by accountable British parliamentarians and applied by British judges .
<en> The fact that the EU is seeking to extend its powers into areas hitherto reserved for Member States exclusively shows the true aim of the EU : to create a federal superstate .
<en> People in my region do not want to see that occurring .
<en> They reject the conventional wisdom of ever-closer union and want to see a looser , more flexible system of intergovernmental cooperation .
<en> I hope the new group in which British Conservatives will sit in the next parliament will be able to deliver what most Britons want from Europe .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , again I want to say we are not deciding whether the External Action Service will be there or not : it is already there with the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> As my colleague just said , and I too am confident , the Lisbon Treaty will be in force fairly soon .
<en> I shall now comment on a few things that have come up in the discussion , and I think it is worthwhile taking them up .
<en> First of all , we , as the Commission , are committed to making the EEAS a success .
<en> It needs to be a shared enterprise with full buy-in of all the EU institutions and the Member States from the very start .
<en> From my own experience as Commissioner for External Relations , I think a lot of things will be done in different ways in future .
<en> I can see the need for the High Representative Vice-President to have a degree of managerial and budgetary autonomy .
<en> At the same time , it is clear that the EEAS will need very close links with a wide range of Commission services and therefore , it is important that we work together .
<en> I support Parliament 's objectives of ensuring transparent and accountable budgetary arrangements for the EEAS .
<en> That is also clear so I think that we are looking forward to working towards the right formula on that .
<en> Second , under the Treaty , the political accountability for the European Parliament is primarily through the President of the Commission and the High Representative Vice-President and other Members of the Commission .
<en> We welcome the clear signal in Mr Brok 's report that the High Representative Vice-President should be the appointing authority for the EEAS and the senior delegation staff .
<en> In the new system , heads of delegation and other senior EEAS staff will be EU officials under the Staff Regulations , subject to defined appointment procedures and obligations of independence .
<en> We would have questions about the implications of singling out one group for EP hearings in this way .
<en> Even if it were a question of hearings only for a more political post , the same consideration would apply .
<en> I think this is certainly not in line with the practice in Member States .
<en> Again , we understand , however , that Parliament has an interest in having an in-depth exchange , be it formal or be it informal , with key senior officials in the EEAS and the delegations .
<en> I think this could be done after somebody has been appointed ; then they should go to Parliament and discuss things with Parliament .
<en> I have also noted with great interest and pleasure that the question of human rights and the question of women 's rights have been mentioned .
<en> I can only tell you that all the EU institutions are committed to gender mainstreaming .
<en> This will also apply in the EEAS , but appointments also have to be on merit , so merit and gender mainstreaming have to go together .
<en> I wanted to quickly comment on the Israeli Government and my trip to the Middle East .
<en> After the Gaza conflict , it was very important to obtain a ceasefire .
<en> I tried to contribute to the first ceasefire and I think it was my intervention in particular that made it possible to open humanitarian corridors and set times to deliver humanitarian goods at that very difficult and decisive moment .
<en> Finally , on the matter of delegations , as I said before : they are open already .
<en> The European parliamentary delegations that you mentioned are already open for Commissioners or for Council members to go there , but it also depends on the time schedule .
<en> The situation should be the same in the future .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the attacks that have been made here on a common European foreign and security policy belong in the past .
<2en> In opinion polls , 70 % of the citizens of Europe say that they want a stronger common foreign and security policy , because they know that this is the only way of keeping the peace in Europe and of looking after the interests of Europe throughout the world .
<2en> The statements that you have made belong to the past .
<2en> These are the sort of statements that have led Europe into war and we want to put an end to them .
<2en> We would also like to state that we want this foreign policy to strengthen Europe 's ability to act .
<2en> I would also like to say explicitly that foreign policy is not the job of parliaments .
<2en> Operational foreign policy must be the responsibility of the executive .
<2en> This is the case in all national states .
<2en> However , this means that parliaments - and in this case the European Parliament - must have full rights of control .
<2en> It must be made clear how this applies to the budget , in which areas there is a right to information and where there is genuine accountability .
<2en> I would like to invite the Council and the Commission to include in their documents less information about organigrams and about the members of the national delegations who will be appointed to specific posts .
<2en> Instead , they must describe the rights of the Parliament in these COREPER documents and not simply say that the rights of Parliament must be maintained full stop .
<2en> I believe that some action must be taken here .
<2en> In addition , I am of the opinion that the High Representative or Vice-President , who has yet to be appointed , must be involved in drawing up the proposals and must not be presented with a fait accompli .
<2en> This must also be taken into account .
<2en> Mrs Malmström , it would generate a lot of confidence if you would refer to the High Representative in future as the High Representative or Vice-President of the Commission .
<2en> Then we would all be talking about the same subject and this would be helpful in establishing that we really are speaking about the same thing .
<2en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Thursday , 22 October 2009 .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 149 )
<sp>
<2en> The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us .
<2en> I am grateful to Mr Brok and to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the excellent work they have done in spite of the little time available .
<2en> On the basis of this work , the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service .
<2en> The message that we want to send out to the Commission and the Council is basically this : we want a service that has extensive powers and which fulfils our ambitions of making the European Union a global political player , and we want this to happen on a consensual basis , that is to say , with the involvement and the support of all three institutions - Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
<2en> I therefore urge the Commission to be courageous in the negotiations and to defend the Community model , and I invite the Council once again to involve this Parliament and , in particular , the committee that I chair , in the negotiations from the outset , in order to complete this crucial stage in the creation of a true European foreign policy .
<sp>
<2en> The creation of the European External Action Service is an absolute must in order to improve the effectiveness of the EU 's external action .
<2en> The purpose of this is to promote a much more consistent foreign policy and raise the EU 's profile at an international level .
<2en> However , achieving these objectives depends on how we organise this service .
<2en> The report contains a number of particularly important proposals .
<2en> We need an organisation which is as streamlined as possible and avoids any duplication .
<2en> This is why I support the merger of Commission delegations in third countries , of the Council 's liaison offices and the offices of the EU Special Representatives , as well as the creation of ' EU embassies ' .
<2en> From an efficiency perspective , I also find it an interesting proposal that these delegations will adopt certain consular functions , such as dealing with Schengen visas .
<2en> I wish to stress the need for standard training for staff so that we can really have a professional service which meets the EU 's needs .
<2en> Setting up a European diplomatic college seems an ideal solution to me for providing diplomatic staff with training based on common standards in order to guarantee consistency for the EEAS .
<2en> Indeed , in the future , a European diplomatic career could become just as attractive as a diplomatic career for a Member State .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the Paliadeli report on the European Ombudsman 's activities .
<en> The Ombudsman provides an important service to EU citizens and helps ensure that the European institutions operate within both the law and wider general principles .
<en> These wider principles include equality , non-discrimination , and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and I accordingly supported my colleague Ms Auken 's amendment seeking to define more clearly the concept of ' maladministration ' .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Mrs Paliadeli 's report on the European Ombudsman 's activities as I believe that Mr Diamandouros has made a significant contribution in terms of resolving citizens ' problems and bringing the European Union 's institutions closer to citizens .
<2en> At the same time , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her efforts in completing this report .
<2en> The European Mediator has played a key role in increasing transparency and responsibility as part of the European Union 's decision-making process and administrative system .
<2en> I sincerely hope that the 44 inquiries closed with critical remarks in 2008 will lead , in the future , to a reduction in the number of maladministration cases .
<2en> I am in favour of a broad interpretation of the term ' maladministration ' , which needs to include unlawful administrative acts or infringements of binding legal rules or principles , as well as cases where the administrative authorities have been sloppy , negligent or lacking in transparency in their duty to citizens or have infringed other principles of good administration .
<sp>
<2en> In view of the important role played by the European Ombudsman , in that he promotes transparency in the relations between the European Union and its citizens , I reiterate my position that constructive relationships have been developed among all the Community institutions and bodies .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the Paliadeli report on the annual report on the European Ombudsman 's activities because I believe that the Ombudsman has carried out his duties in an active and balanced manner , in terms of examining and managing complaints , conducting and concluding investigations , maintaining constructive relations with the institutions and bodies of the European Union and raising citizens ' awareness regarding their rights in respect of those institutions and bodies .
<2en> It is worth highlighting the good level of cooperation between the European Ombudsman and other European bodies , particularly the European Parliament 's Committee on Petitions .
<2en> For this reason , by voting for the report , we wanted to give him our backing in his role as an external control mechanism and as a valuable source of proposals for improvements to European administration .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the European Ombudsman 's activities in 2008 , which emphasises the growing number of complaints concerning the EU 's lack of transparency .
<2en> This data worries me .
<2en> I therefore support this resolution , which calls for the Ombudsman 's activities to be given a higher profile .
<2en> Indeed , it is regrettable that 36 % of the 355 inquiries completed by the Ombudsman in 2008 concern the lack of transparency of the European institutions , and include cases in which requests for information were refused .
<2en> I feel it is important to point out that responsible and transparent administration of the European Union is a guarantee of the trust that the citizens place in the European Union .

<en> The next item is Question Time ( B7-0223 / 2009 ) .
<en> The following questions are addressed to the Commission .
<en> Subject : Commission action to foster an environment that spurs corporate investment in research and encourages banks to finance that investment
<en> 2009 is the European Year of Creativity and Innovation .
<en> The Lisbon Strategy , which was adopted in 2000 , aims to make the European economy ' the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy ' by 2010 .
<en> That aim has given rise to two other objectives : raising the employment rate to a minimum of 70 % of the labour force and increasing the level of investment in research to at least 3 % of GDP , with two-thirds of that amount coming from the private sector .
<en> Unfortunately , 2009 has been marked by an economic and financial crisis affecting all the EU Member States and restricting private companies ' access to financing instruments .
<en> Overall research investment is no greater than 1.85 % of GDP , and only five Member States have invested over 2 % of GDP in research .
<en> Member States will only recover economically if the EU manages to remain competitive , and that is dependent on there being investment in research and education .
<en> What action does the Commission have in mind to foster an environment that spurs private companies to invest in research , and particularly in applied research , and encourages banks to finance investment in research and innovation ?
<sp>
<2en> Europe 's policy on research and innovation is essentially based on the Seventh Framework Programme for Research , which runs from 2007 to 2013 , the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme , which runs for the same period , and the cohesion funds , which likewise run over the same period .
<2en> In preparation for these three major programmes , the Commission put forward a long-term strategy and an action plan in 2005 and 2006 .
<2en> The action plan was put forward in 2005 , while the broadly-framed innovation strategy dates from 2006 .
<2en> The results of these different programmes are set out in comprehensive documentation from the Commission and have often been discussed here in Parliament .
<2en> I would be happy , Mrs Ţicău , to provide you with all these documents once again .
<2en> Within the confines of Question Time , it is not possible to spell out their contents to you , but I do want to attempt to highlight the key points .
<2en> Through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research , we did experience a truly remarkable rise in European expenditure on research and development whilst a series of new instruments , in particular , the joint technology initiatives , were also created and these have proven their worth extremely well .
<2en> The cohesion funds are new and better suited to the aim of promoting research and innovation and it is really remarkable if you look at the figures - the provision for these areas in the cohesion and structural funds for the stated period is EUR 86 billion , which , in any case , is 25 % of the total structural and cohesion funds .
<2en> A new instrument has been created within the scope of European structural policy , the JEREMIE support initiative , which , above all , is about providing easier access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> This is being done in collaboration with the European Investment Fund .
<2en> The programme to promote innovation and competitiveness , which I am responsible for , is also essentially a programme that creates funding instruments .
<2en> The major share of the money is actually spent on facilitating access for small and medium-sized enterprises to funding instruments that are designed to improve their capacity to innovate .
<2en> I am sure you know that our European growth and employment policy does not have very many quantitative targets .
<2en> We do have one quantitative target , however , which has been unchanged since the year 2000 .
<2en> That target is to spend 3 % of gross domestic product on research and development .
<2en> We can already say , today , that this target will not be achieved .
<2en> Just looking at the percentages , however , is a little misleading , since , after all , the absolute figures for spending on research and development in the European Union from 2000 to 2006 rose by 14.8 % .
<2en> That is a greater rate of increase than , for example , the United States .
<2en> Despite that , we have to say that the results are not satisfactory , for which reason the Council adopted a document entitled ' Vision 2020 ' for the European Research Area as far back as December of last year , which was concerned with the issue of whether we could mobilise greater funding for European research and development policy .
<2en> I do not want to hide from you my concern that the current economic recession threatens the long-term strategy of driving forward research and development .
<2en> The Commission reacted very quickly to this threat in November 2008 .
<2en> The European Economic Recovery Plan , which complements the Member States ' measures to combat the economic crisis and aims to provide impetus and counter the difficult situation in the financial sector , is heavily focused on the areas of investment in research and development and promoting investment .
<2en> I will give you three examples : the Factories of the Future initiative , which relates to the modernisation of Europe 's industrial base , with EUR 1.2 billion in funding ; the Energy-efficient Buildings initiative , for which EUR 1 billion has been allocated ; and the Partnership for Building Green Cars , which has also been allocated EUR 1 billion in the field of research , topped up with expenditure amounting to EUR 4 billion from other economic measures .
<2en> The Commission has already begun preparations for the next growth and employment strategy .
<2en> Without giving away any secrets - as President Barroso has already discussed this in his guidelines - I can also say that research , development and innovation will play an absolutely key role in the next growth and employment strategy .
<2en> I have another comment to make on innovation .
<2en> Europe is actually in a pretty good position when it comes to research policy .
<2en> We have good , and in some cases outstanding , research capacities .
<2en> We also have very good results when it comes to technological development .
<2en> We could certainly be better , though , when it comes to innovation .
<2en> If we understand innovation to be the practical application of research and development work for products , services , design and methods - in other words , anything where a practical application is possible - we still see a huge potential to create additional growth and additional employment in Europe .
<2en> The Commission therefore announced this year that it is to bring forward an ' innovation act ' .
<2en> An ' act ' in this sense is a new political instrument that we developed for the first time in connection with small and medium-sized enterprises - you will remember the Small Business Act - and we will be bringing forward an innovation act that brings together legislative measures , policy initiatives and politically-binding guidelines in a major package .
<2en> I have endeavoured to direct this work in such a way that the new Commission will be free to decide when it wants to bring forward this innovation act .
<2en> You will understand that I cannot pre-empt that - it will be for the new Commission to decide .
<2en> The preparatory work , however , has already made good progress and I think I can say with certainty that Parliament will be dealing with the subject of this innovation act within the next year .
<2en> Allow me , in concluding , to say that we have seen good progress overall on a broad front over the last few years , although it has been very erratic .
<2en> It is necessary , in this regard , however , to take an even-handed view .
<2en> We cannot , for example , expect the new Member States to match the spending proportion of gross domestic product of the older Member States on research , development and innovation straight away .
<2en> I am very pleased to see , however , that the new Member States - especially those that are in greatest need of catching up - are also making up ground the quickest , so that I see developments overall as positive .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Thank you for the information and answer you have provided .
<en> I would like to ask the Commission whether it is intending to hold discussions with Europe 's banking institutions about the possibility of providing guarantees and loans at a preferential rate of interest for the research and innovation companies and projects which are currently considered to be a major risk .
<en> In addition , European research programmes such as the Seventh Framework Programme , which apply for up to 50 % cofinancing , are not very suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> I would like to ask the Commission whether it is intending to modify these programmes to increase the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises .
<sp>
<2en> Mrs Ţicău , that is a very worthwhile point , and I am pleased to be able to tell you that this is exactly what the Commission thinks and is therefore exactly how it has acted .
<2en> I want to reiterate that the crucial problem for our small and medium-sized enterprises is attaining the necessary venture capital in order to be able to pay for research and development .
<2en> Two important instruments have been created in this area , namely the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and the JEREMIE programme .
<2en> In both cases , the issue at hand is the same , namely the ability to mobilise cut-rate credit via the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund , respectively , with the aid of venture capital - in other words , the direct participation of business capital - and with the aid of guarantees , in order to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises to this credit .
<2en> These are major investment programmes in which many hundreds of thousands of European businesses take part .
<2en> I am sure you understand that the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund are not able to manage the details of each individual granting of credit .
<2en> That is why this takes place via intermediaries , usually banks in the Member States .
<2en> According to the most recent information I have , the situation is that we have reached a position in all the Member States whereby the national banking system is integrated into this policy and businesses that are seeking access to the funds provided from the Community budget are able to get said funds via the national banking system in question .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) My question relates to the concept of eurostars , something that we implemented in EUREKA , which , in particular , facilitated quick and efficient allocation for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> Do you believe that the said programme can be extended ?
<en> Furthermore , how do you see the challenge for the Eighth Framework Programme for Research , where the idea of us providing EUR 50 billion in future for research into energy efficiency , in particular , in relation to SMEs , is being discussed .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) According to the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Union 's economy is a social market economy .
<en> Our main concern must be to create new jobs , reduce unemployment and emerge from the economic crisis .
<en> Member States in South-Eastern Europe are faced with huge deficits .
<en> They must stimulate the creation of new jobs , while maintaining a long-term , sustainable fiscal policy .
<en> Education , health , agriculture and development of the transport and energy infrastructure remain the main priorities for these Member States .
<en> It is important for the level of agricultural subsidies in these Member States to be on a par with those in older Member States .
<en> Assistance offered by the EU over a period of five years for balance of payments can be granted if the beneficiary Member States commit to reforming their system of taxes and duties or if they adopt measures to boost their administrative capacity in order to increase and achieve maximum absorption of European funds .
<en> These Member States also need to be supported in modernising their heavily polluting industrial sectors in order to reduce emissions , but preserve jobs and ensure economic development .
<en> I would like to add as a final point that I believe that support for these Member States requires the cohesion policy for the 2014-2020 period to continue to help Europe 's regions which are less well developed economically .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating the promoters of this debate , because it really is very important that we discuss the situation of economically weaker countries and countries outside the euro area .
<en> That is particularly so at a time when we are discussing strategies for coming out of the crisis , when we will have to bear in mind the different situations the various countries are facing .
<en> The situation is difficult in many economies in Eastern and Central Europe , but things are now starting to become difficult in many economies in the western part that are inside the euro area .
<en> My country , Portugal , is an example .
<en> The strategy must take account of the various situations , which differ from one country to another .
<en> Several different paths can be taken .
<en> It is extremely important to have a suitable monetary and budgetary policy , if possible , one that is increasingly determined by political criteria that take into account the need for liquidity for companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , that do not create or perpetuate obstacles that are very difficult for countries outside the euro area to overcome , and that exert pressure on national governments to carry out the medium- and long-term reforms that are needed .
<en> To conclude , we have to move on from words to deeds .
<en> Cohesion has to be effective .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Thanks to the successful implementation of the European Economic Recovery Plan , we will notice a slight improvement next year , in 2010 , for the European Union 's Member States .
<en> The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been affected in different ways by the economic crisis .
<en> On the one hand , Poland has recorded slight economic growth , thereby avoiding the crisis , whereas Romania and Hungary have been severely affected by the economic crisis .
<en> Romania has experienced an unprecedented economic crisis this year , which has also been exacerbated by the serious political instability triggered by the Socialists , who wanted to leave the government for electoral purposes due to the forthcoming presidential elections .
<en> The presidential elections were only two months away .
<en> The Socialists ' departure from government and the introduction of a motion of censure in parliament left Romania for two months with a temporary government with curtailed powers , which was unable to finalise and adopt a draft budget in parliament .
<en> As a result , the International Monetary Fund postponed delivering to us the third tranche of a loan amounting to EUR 1.5 billion .
<en> However , the Swiss Government decided to grant us a non-refundable loan amounting to approximately EUR 120 million .
<en> My country has recorded 8 % negative economic growth and an unemployment level two points below the European Union average .
<en> In the future , the EU requires a strategy focused on getting governments to step back from supporting their national economies .
<en> However , this will not be possible in Romania until 2010 as we are not allowed to do so by the agreement signed with the IMF .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) I agree with the proverb that if you are coming from a fishing trip and you meet someone on the way , you should teach them to fish instead of giving them a fish .
<en> However , we have to know that we need to teach them to fish .
<en> I am referring on this point to the states which have recently joined the EU and still need to learn .
<en> However , they cannot learn off their own bat .
<en> We also need to give them the financial resources to do so .
<en> I personally believe that a healthy economy is mainly made up of medium-sized enterprises .
<en> As a result , economic , social and territorial cohesion policies must be targeted primarily at allocating European cohesion funds for this type of economy .
<en> I would like to add that the EU 's economic , social and territorial cohesion policy has been neglected recently in terms of defining the European Union 's priorities .
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) While listening to Mrs Băsescu , I cannot help but declare : ' O , les pauvres !
<en> What holy simplicity in the European Parliament ' .
<en> Returning to more serious matters , the economic contraction in the countries of Central Europe has reached drastic proportions .
<en> The disparities are growing between these countries and the rich countries of Western Europe .
<en> Furthermore , these countries ' capacities to generate economic and financial incentives remains at such a low level that it is almost negligible .
<en> I want to draw the European Commission 's attention to the fact that , as a result of the social costs , the considerable rise in unemployment and swingeing budget cuts , these countries ' capacities to provide cofinancing for projects with European funding is also diminished .
<en> All these factors may condemn the countries of Central Europe ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the decision of the European Court of Human Rights has upset not only worshippers but also everyone who , for centuries , has viewed the crucifix as a sign of hope and solidarity , something providing solace and freedom from fear and pain .
<en> We hope that that decision will be modified by the Grand Chamber since it is clearly irrational .
<en> Should we do away with the very name of the Red Cross ?
<en> Should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys ?
<en> Will it be prohibited for the Queen of England , as has already been mentioned , to be the head of the Anglican Church ?
<en> Nevertheless , the case invites a very important reflection from a civil and political point of view : are human rights merely the rights of individuals , as parties isolated from a social environment , or is the right to express a specific form of piety also a right of the peoples ?
<en> Do tradition , history , intelligence and art count for nothing when , for millennia , they have characterised a people 's identity ?
<en> Furthermore , the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights , and I note that the latter , aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable , may be interpreted in different ways , and human rights may even conflict with each other .
<en> Why should a state be denied the chance , through its laws , to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people ?
<en> The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes .
<en> On other occasions , the European Court has recognised , with regard to the right to life , the exclusive power of the States to decide on the most controversial matters , such as the regulation of abortion and euthanasia .
<en> Now , the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and consequently , as the European Union , also to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights .
<en> Therefore , we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court .
<en> It would be a serious matter if a supranational power , especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will , were to become repressive and demeaning , insensitive to people 's feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom .
<en> This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) The history of Europe , its individual states and therefore also the EU is , like it nor not , closely connected with the Christian heritage .
<en> Consequently , even the constitutions of many states contain a reference to Christian traditions .
<en> Even the Treaty on European Union in its preamble draws inspiration , inter alia , from Europe 's religious heritage , from which universal values have developed .
<en> Fundamental rights in the EU are today guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms but , above all , they arise from constitutional traditions common to the Member States which have developed over centuries .
<en> I therefore believe that the EU must fully respect national history , culture and traditions and resolutely refuse to penalise Member States who defend their right to their own special make-up and character , including the Christian heritage and Christian symbols .
<en> In conclusion , I would merely like to add that neither the Charter nor the European Convention enlarge the powers of the Union .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , I would like to start by asking to borrow some words that I am going to make my own .
<en> The crucifix is not a sign of imposition .
<en> It is a symbol that represents positive values , which are part of our history , our culture and a society that dates back more than 2 000 years .
<en> We cannot claim to protect fundamental rights by denying the very values that created them .
<en> Democracy works through freedom and respect , facilitating the exercise of rights , not through imposition or limitation .
<en> Yes of course , the principle of subsidiarity must be respected and recognised by all European institutions , organisations and courts , especially freedom , whether it is freedom of opinion or freedom of belief .
<en> The authority of the Member States to display religious symbols in public places as a symbol that represents the traditions and identity of their peoples should not and cannot be infringed .
<en> Freedom is an essential element of our society and the basic pillar on which the single area of freedom , security and justice is built .
<en> If it were to be limited or censored , the very foundations of the European Union would collapse .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , I , too , consider that the Court is wrong to find that having a crucifix in schoolrooms is tantamount to disrespect for other people 's religious faith .
<en> The issue we are debating today is a social rather than a legal issue .
<en> Obviously we must abide by the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> The presence of religious symbols is not a sign of religious discrimination or coercion .
<en> It is a result of the tradition and history of every country and often of its Constitution , as is the case in my country , Greece .
<en> In Greece , we have religious icons in schoolrooms , not in order to impose some specific religion on pupils , but because it forms part of our tradition and is directly connected to the values and structures of our society , directly connected to four centuries of persecution and religious oppression by the Ottoman Empire .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) I would like to respond briefly to three points .
<en> On this evening at the close of the year and in the run-up to Christmas , before midnight on a Tuesday , almost sixty years after the founding of the European Union , we are still discussing one of the pillars of European integration .
<en> We are discussing the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> Secondly , the question of Mr Borghezio relates to the decision of the European Court in Strasbourg that the presence of crosses in Italian schools is a breach of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights .
<en> This decision has provoked fears in many states .
<en> The Slovak parliament last week passed a resolution in which it stated that this decision is in conflict with the cultural heritage and Christian history of Europe .
<en> And finally , I did not feel entirely comfortable during the reading of the draft joint resolution on which we will vote on Thursday .
<en> I am disappointed that we lack the courage to include in a resolution that talks about subsidiarity those points from the Lisbon Treaty that are directly connected to the programme that has been passed .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , can I begin by wishing the High Representative , Baroness Ashton , well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate .
<en> As she knows well , and as the United Nations has stated , the situation in Haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades , as the numbers of missing people , victims and deaths continue to rise .
<en> The human cost of this tragedy is immeasurable .
<en> While relief aid is beginning to arrive , we are all aware of the significant problems that aid workers are facing in trying to get assistance to those that need it most .
<en> Increasing security , logistical and bureaucracy problems have been identified by the NGOs on the ground as hampering aid and making a disastrous situation worse .
<en> These are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for Haitians .
<en> In all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos , clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed .
<en> NGOs , government bodies , international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need .
<en> It is clear that the country needs massive international support immediately .
<en> The response from European citizens and their record generosity and solidarity have been immense .
<en> Yesterday 's announcement of over EUR 420 million in European Union humanitarian aid for Haiti shows leadership and commitment , but its delivery must be coordinated and effective .
<en> The European Union 's stated aim is to consolidate and strengthen the global relief effort .
<en> I hope that you , Mrs Ashton , and Commissioner De Gucht , work strongly towards this aim in the respective visits to the United States , Haiti and elsewhere later this week .
<en> The long-term development of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere must become a priority .
<en> The allocation of EUR 200 million in European Union aid to help Haiti rebuild in the long term is a positive start , but , when the cameras have left and the world 's attention is turned elsewhere , the European Union , as a global leader , must act and live up to its responsibility .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this new humanitarian crisis that Haiti is enduring is perhaps on a greater scale than all previous ones , so much so that I doubt that it is possible to find the right words to talk about the victims , to speak to the survivors and to reach out to families in order to tell them how much we share their pain and are aware of our responsibility .
<2en> However violent the earthquake was , it alone does not explain the extent of the damage .
<2en> The latter is also linked to the chronic poverty that Haiti has endured for many years .
<2en> Until now , the international community has been incapable of changing anything there .
<2en> Worse , by imposing policies on Haiti that we now know did not work , international institutions , Europe and its partners have exacerbated the fragility of its social fabric , its economy and its institutions .
<2en> In the 1970s , Haiti was almost self-sufficient where food was concerned .
<2en> It used to produce 90 % of its agricultural needs .
<2en> Today , it imports more than half .
<2en> This must surely have had a detrimental effect on local production .
<2en> Before this earthquake , Haiti was a country without resources because it was deprived of the resources to which it was entitled .
<2en> We must therefore firstly provide Haiti with as much support as possible in order to deal with emergencies .
<2en> From this point of view , we cannot but lament the fact that international aid has been very difficult to put into place .
<2en> In future , we must improve our procedures .
<2en> However , we must , above all , be aware that long-term development aid will not be effective if we impose what we consider to be the right priorities while everyone on the ground is telling us that we are wrong .
<2en> We must proceed by calling our own methods into question , and that will not work unless we increase the funds that we are putting aside for development policies in the long term .
<2en> The European Union has announced the amount of aid that it will release for Haiti , and the Member States have done the same .
<2en> We are talking about EUR 130 million in the short term , and EUR 200 million for long-term needs .
<2en> I would like to compare these figures to other figures , to the USD 155 billion that the banks of the City and Wall Street are getting ready to pay to a few thousand people who work in the banks .
<2en> That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level .
<2en> Urgent humanitarian aid is necessary , but it alone is not enough .
<2en> It must not , under any circumstances , supplant development aid , which itself must not be experienced by the countries that are supposed to benefit from it as a veritable diktat .
<2en> The first way of assisting countries in great difficulty is to continue to respect them , to allow them to benefit from their own resources .
<2en> We must cancel Haiti 's debt and pay off our debt to that country .
<2en> Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is our duty to the victims of Haiti to help them rebuild a country that was devastated even before a natural disaster turned it completely on its head .
<2en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , our hearts and minds go out to the people of Haiti in their hour of suffering .
<en> I commend Baroness Ashton and Karel De Gucht for what they have already said has happened and is being done .
<en> There is no question that there will be funds coming .
<en> I was present at the tsunami which hit Sri Lanka and then later Indonesia .
<en> I have witnessed earthquakes in Turkey .
<en> I watched what happened in China .
<en> Every time one of these things happens , we are caught short , not with water purification tablets or tents or clean water but with infrastructure .
<en> We say , oh , the infrastructure is destroyed .
<en> Of course it is destroyed .
<en> We need to be able to supply very rapidly an emergency infrastructure .
<en> How can this happen ?
<en> What about an aircraft carrier ?
<en> It has electricity , it has nuclear power , it has generators for water purification and it has helicopters .
<en> Could we set up a global rescue operation , ready to go at a moment 's notice , that can provide makeshift harbours , temporary shelters and all the infrastructure that gets destroyed ?
<en> We need to think afresh as to how to save lives immediately afterwards .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Vice-President and High Representative , Commissioner , I would like to say , once again , that we have been deeply distressed by what the Haitian people , the children of Haiti are having to endure .
<2en> For seven days now , they have been living , surviving in an absolute hell .
<2en> The surge of global solidarity warms the heart , but it still has to be consolidated and better coordinated for the sole purpose of helping the Haitian people , who are thirsty , starving , homeless and deprived of the most elementary medical care .
<2en> We salute all those men and women who are involved in this .
<2en> The European Union has decided to release some initial funds .
<2en> However , we cannot leave it there .
<2en> European Union aid must be increased considerably , and the global banking system must become involved .
<2en> European food surpluses must be shipped out to the Haitian people as a matter of urgency .
<2en> Let us be frank .
<2en> Our continent is truly indebted to Haiti and has a duty to make amends for so many years of domination and plundering .
<2en> Lessons must be learned from the way this island , the pearl of the Caribbean , has been controlled by international financial institutions that have stifled it with appalling debt and the equally appalling interest linked to that debt .
<2en> Our Parliament should declare itself in favour of the immediate and unconditional cancellation of this entire debt .
<2en> Our group would like the conference that will soon take place in Montreal to make effective preparations for an international conference on the repair , reconstruction and sustainable development of Haiti with the people of Haiti .
<2en> This reconstruction must be placed under the auspices of the United Nations , so that the Haitian people can recover their economic and political sovereignty .
<2en> Haiti must not be the prize in a battle for domination between big powers .
<2en> Thus , while we commend the United States ' support efforts , we must be on guard and refuse to allow the North American leaders to use this terrible disaster as a pretext to occupy the island , to run it and to establish military bases there .
<2en> Europe must lead by example .
<2en> It must have only one objective , one sole concern : the people , the children of Haiti .

<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my deep solidarity with all those who have been hit by this natural disaster .
<2en> In situations like this , with the large-scale destruction of buildings and infrastructure and with thousands of deaths , it is almost impossible to deliver aid effectively without having minimum conditions of public order and security .
<2en> Any aid efforts are difficult without close coordination in collecting the necessary items and ordered distribution of aid .
<2en> It is essential to understand what is needed , by whom and when .
<2en> Another point to think about is that on too many occasions , the generosity of public and private donors has been betrayed and huge amounts of money have not gone to those who really needed them .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to have a strict system of controls to prevent money being squandered or stolen , particularly in fragile countries with high levels of corruption and low levels of governance .
<2en> Europe ought to demonstrate its own efficiency .
<2en> I hope it is successful .

<en> The next item is the report ( A5-0277 / 2000 ) by Mrs Sartori , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments [ COM ( 1999 ) 628 - C5-0307 / 2000 - 2000 / 0807 ( CNS ) ] .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I am tabling a proposal for a resolution on the Commission 's report on the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments .
<2en> The financial assistance is currently governed by Council Regulation No 1969 of 1988 .
<2en> This mechanism can be activated either at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , a provision which remains in force during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union for the States which are covered by a derogation , currently Denmark , the United Kingdom and Sweden .
<2en> The regulation and the proposal for a regulation have merged two mechanisms ( medium-term financial assistance and the Community loan mechanism intended to provide medium-term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments ) into a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance .
<2en> This proposal changes the mechanism ' s ceiling .
<2en> The fact that , at the moment , only three countries can benefit from it suggests that the amount hitherto available - EUR 16 billion - can be reduced .
<2en> At the same time , however , past experience tells us that we cannot reduce it by very much , for the very reason that the last time the mechanism was used , in 1993 , the loan was for EUR 8 billion .
<2en> Therefore , although the increase in convergence of States reduces the likelihood that the mechanism will be used , it must still have sufficient resources to meet the simultaneous needs of several countries , should this be necessary .
<2en> This is why we propose to reduce the amount available from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion .
<2en> This resolution also envisages the possibility of considering creating a special mechanism providing financial assistance to the balance of payments of the candidate countries .
<2en> Clearly , this is a possibility for the future and therefore does not have a bearing on the present situation , but it is a possibility which I considered that we could at least examine in some depth so that we will be prepared should these issues arise .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Sartori for her report , which we have found very valuable .
<2en> The aim of this Commission report is to provide a basis for examining the single facility providing medium-term financial support and for revising it , should this prove necessary .
<2en> The financial mechanism implements Article 119 of the EC Treaty , which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union .
<2en> The last assessment was carried out in October 1997 on the basis of a report drawn up by the Commission .
<2en> On that occasion , the Council endorsed the Commission ' s position , which recommended that the mechanism should be continued , and decided that a further assessment , carried out according to the same procedure , would be necessary in the light of the changes linked to the commencement of the third stage .
<2en> The Commission is therefore bound to submit a report to the Council so that the Council can carry out this additional assessment of the mechanism .
<2en> The report makes three principle recommendations .
<2en> Firstly , the single facility should be continued in that it is an instrument implementing Article 119 of the Treaty which will continue to apply to the Member States which are not part of the eurozone ; until they participate in the single currency , these Member States , in a similar way to the new Members of the Community , are liable to encounter problems with their balances of payments and therefore to wish to have recourse to the mechanism under consideration .
<2en> In view of the current level of economic , financial and monetary integration , the likelihood that these Member States will encounter difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view , but the mechanism must , nevertheless , remain in force .
<2en> Secondly , the possibility of having recourse to funds contributed by other Member States to finance the loans granted under the mechanism should be eliminated since , for various reasons , it has never been used .
<2en> In future , recourse to the capital market should be the only option available .
<2en> Thirdly and finally , the drop in the number of Member States who could now apply for this form of financial support and the need to cover the potential borrowing requirement of new Member States justify lowering the mechanism 's ceiling from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion .
<2en> The Economic and Financial Committee has drawn up an opinion which it sent to the Presidency on 14 July 2000 .
<2en> The Committee considers that the conclusions of the analysis of the single facility performed by the Commission are in line with its positions .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Commissioner .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.

<en> ( IT ) Madam President , High Representative , ladies and gentlemen , the serious political , economic and social crisis in Yemen is linked to the operational presence of al-Qaeda on its territory and the jihadist vision that motivates it .
<en> Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world and the management of internal conflicts bristles with difficulties because of the religious origins of the conflict between the Shi 'ite and Sunni minorities .
<en> As the motion for a resolution stresses , aid , cooperation and support for the implementation of social assistance programmes are vital .
<en> We should , however , stress the risks that the West also runs if the security problems are not tackled clearly and with determination .
<en> The reasons that drive terrorists to acquire military training and train in acts of martyrdom are the product of jihadist ideology , which is becoming increasingly widespread and entrenched on the African continent too , partly because of the indifference and superficiality with which the international community has dealt , or rather has not dealt , with al-Qaeda and its cells in Somalia and Sudan , as well as in Yemen .
<en> We should remember the cause and effect relationship between the terrorist presence in Yemen and the number of acts carried out to destabilise Somalia , which is a pawn controlled by al-Qaeda forces in Yemen .
<en> These in turn are dependent not so much on the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia as on the Iranian ayatollahs , from whom they receive weapons and money .
<en> Support for Yemen cannot be divorced from the issue of security .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , Mrs Ashton , you were right to stress that the important thing in Yemen in terms of security priority is to end the internal conflicts that exist in that country .
<en> We must not confuse the causes and the consequences , and without playing down the terrorist risk , the main reason for the instability in Yemen is not terrorism .
<en> Terrorism develops because there is instability due to internal conflicts .
<en> From this point of view , the priority of the European Union should be to encourage and to support the efforts currently being made to start a national dialogue in Yemen with President Saleh .
<en> At regional level , there are - as we have just been reminded - links with the Somalian crisis and the crisis in the Horn of Africa .
<en> There are very sizeable migratory flows , but also arms trafficking and movement of jihadist fighters between Yemen and Somalia .
<en> In this respect , I would like to know where the European Union stands as regards the strengthening of maritime surveillance capacities , which also concern Yemen .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , Yemen is the poorest country of the Arab world .
<en> I was in Yemen not long ago and saw this with my own eyes .
<en> There is no doubt that poverty is the source , or at least a factor , which intensifies some of the many problems the country faces .
<en> Unfortunately , in the global world , Yemen 's problems are also becoming our problems .
<en> The internal conflicts referred to in the draft resolution and during this debate should be resolved by political means , and the sides in the conflicts should respect human rights and international humanitarian law .
<en> The European Union should make efforts to prevent escalation of the present crisis .
<en> The development aid which we give , if it is effective and if it is sensibly spent , can be of help in bringing about political , economic and social stabilisation .
<en> However , a catastrophe is not far away .
<en> The water deficit has been mentioned , as have the dwindling reserves of crude oil , but there is also the problem of the abuse by 90 % of Yemenis of qat , a hallucinogenic narcotic , which is displacing other crops .
<en> For example , Yemen used to export coffee , but now it cannot do this , because this narcotic is being grown instead .
<en> The government in Yemen and the international community must not just take stop-gap measures , because they are faced with structural problems , and even if we can stop al-Qaeda in Yemen , the problems will return if we do not eliminate the causes .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , as we have already heard and as we all realise , the situation in Yemen is drastic from a social and economic point of view and from the point of view of social cohesion .
<en> The country has no water , oil reserves are running out and the inhabitants are growing drug crops .
<en> It is exactly what Afghanistan was 26 years ago when , in this Chamber - I mean in the old Chamber of the European Parliament - we made provision during the debate of the report on narcotics for the future of Afghanistan .
<en> If there is no development-type intervention right now , and if the UN is not allowed to have a constant presence at all levels , Yemen will certainly find itself in the same situation as Afghanistan is today , with unresolved problems .
<en> There are not many ways to combat terrorism and the way in which the West is going about it is certainly not one of them .
<en> The only way to help this country not to become an al-Qaeda outpost is for it to come to agreement with all the Arab countries , not just Saudi Arabia and , of course , we need to make efforts to help this nation move away from a tribal philosophy and civil conflict and to seek democratic rights .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) The failed bomb attempt on 25 December on board the Amsterdam-Detroit flight actually only served to reveal an important fact .
<en> It focused the international community 's attention on the seriousness of the situation in Yemen because , as is well known , there are not one , but three conflicts going on in this country .
<en> Apart from the battle involving the separatist movement in the south , the conflict in Saada province in the north has been reignited by the offensive launched approximately six months ago by government forces against the al-Huthi Shi 'ite rebels , and air strikes have been carried out against al-Qaeda bases .
<en> The humanitarian situation , as was also mentioned by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 5 January , is deeply concerning and is at risk of deteriorating even further if none of these conflicts end .
<en> Looking ahead to the international conference being held next week in London , I believe that the European Union must encourage a coordinated response in order to ensure this country 's stability , which could also contribute to international security .
<en> The path to a united , stable and democratic Yemen lies , in my view , through drafting a consistent plan for boosting both military and economic support and for combating terrorism , which needs to be backed up by specific measures supporting this country 's economic development .
<en> Thank you .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of adopting Turkey 's progress report 2009 .
<2en> Although accession negotiations with Turkey started on 3 October 2005 , they have made very little progress up until now .
<2en> The European Parliament feels that Turkey is still not meeting the Copenhagen political criteria .
<2en> Far-reaching constitutional reform is required to ensure greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
<2en> The European Commission noted that during 2009 , Turkey made some progress , albeit limited , on political reforms .
<2en> The situation in Turkey has improved in terms of freedom of expression in minorities ' languages .
<2en> I believe that the European Union must continue dialogue with Turkey and show openness to this country .
<2en> Turkey is extremely important to Europe , both from the perspective of economic and political ties and for the European Union 's energy security .
<2en> My country wishes to develop the partnership with Turkey as part of both the Black Sea Synergy and the European Union 's neighbourhood programmes .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) In the end , I voted against this resolution as , following its amendment in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and in plenary , we have ended up with a text that assumes Turkish membership of the European Union .
<en> It would have been better to emphasise that the negotiations are not open-ended , which would clear the way for more realistic alternatives such as a preferential partnership .
<en> After all , it is as clear as day that Turkey does not meet the conditions for accession to the EU , and that this will still be the case in 10 , 15 or 20 years time .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have decided to abstain from the final vote on the resolution on Turkey 's progress report 2009 .
<2en> Although the text criticises the ability of this country to shoulder the responsibilities of joining the European Union , my abstention expresses an even more prudent stance .
<2en> The current situation in Turkey with regard to democracy , the rule of law , and the protection of human rights and of minorities is still very far from European standards .
<2en> I refer , in particular , to the Turkish electoral system that does not respect pluralism , to the law on the closure of political parties , to the interference of the military in political life , to the Kurdish issue and to the continuous restrictions on minority rights , religious freedom and press freedom .
<2en> These are , for us , essential values and principles that represent the cornerstone of the European integration process .
<2en> It is true that this country 's admission to the European Union could bring major economic advantages , particularly to our companies , but I believe that compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is a priority condition that the Union must monitor rigorously .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) It is perfectly understandable that the political , economic and cultural elites of Turkey aspire to EU membership .
<en> However , the values , traditions and rules by which we conduct ourselves are public knowledge , and we cannot change them so that simply anyone can join .
<en> It is up to the candidate country to accept them , and eventually , after becoming a Member , to try to live by them , but only then .
<en> However , during the long process of negotiations that has been ongoing with the EU , the Turkish people have felt that violations of their habits and customs - which , it should be said , are not even being observed - are being imposed , only to be denied membership in the referenda that will surely take place in the Member States , even if the politicians do end up agreeing .
<en> Yet Turkey is a friendly nation , with a very rich history and culture .
<en> It is our partner in NATO and deserves to be treated as such .
<en> In view of this , I would suggest that even at this late stage , there could be a referendum in Turkey where the people are asked whether they acknowledge and want to adopt our principles and values , or whether they would now prefer negotiations to begin for a new and deeper special partnership with the EU .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the 2009 progress report on Turkey , as I think it is in the interests of both the EU and Turkey to continue with the membership progress .
<2en> I believe that the EU must meet the commitments that it has made to Turkey .
<2en> For its part , Turkey must commit further to the reform process that is under way .

<en> The next item is the statement from the Commission on the fight against tuberculosis .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I welcome this opportunity on World Tuberculosis Day to underline the Commission 's commitment to addressing the challenges caused by this disease .
<en> We had believed that our successes in past decades had eliminated the threats related to this serious public health concern .
<en> However , for too long , we have mistakenly lowered the guard against tuberculosis .
<en> In 2008 , the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported around 83 000 cases and close to 6 000 deaths due to tuberculosis in the European Union and EFTA countries .
<en> This amounts to about 16 deaths a day .
<en> This is simply unacceptable and requires action by all concerned sectors and stakeholders .
<en> It is unacceptable because tuberculosis is a preventable and curable disease that should not lead to such dramatic consequences .
<en> Tuberculosis is a cross-sector issue and it is linked to many of the public health challenges we face in the European Union , including the spread of anti-microbial resistance , the lack of new effective tools to diagnose and treat tuberculosis , the steep rise of co-infections such as with HIV , and the inequalities , with tuberculosis disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups .
<en> The Commission has launched a number of initiatives over the past years to strengthen capacities to tackle tuberculosis .
<en> In 2000 , tuberculosis was included in the list of priority diseases under EU-wide surveillance .
<en> In this context , the Commission supported several projects that have helped coordinate the surveillance of tuberculosis in the 53 countries of the WHO European Region .
<en> This has improved our shared knowledge and monitoring of the epidemiological situation .
<en> In addition , through its research framework programmes , the Commission supports the development of new treatments , vaccines , drugs and diagnostic tools against tuberculosis .
<en> Since 2002 , more than EUR 124 million has been allocated to these efforts .
<en> But , as tuberculosis is not constrained by borders , we have to support countries beyond the European Union .
<en> The Commission supports developing countries in their tuberculosis control programmes through the European Programme for Action to Confront HIV / AIDS , Malaria and Tuberculosis through External Action ( 2007-2011 ) .
<en> The main channel for financing this support is the Global Fund to fight AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , to which the Commission has contributed EUR 870 million since 2002 , with an annual contribution that amounts to EUR 100 million since 2008 .
<en> In addition , it supports clinical trials and capacity building in sub-Saharan Africa through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership ( EDCTP ) .
<en> Finally , the setting up of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has enabled us to raise our efforts against tuberculosis to a new level .
<en> In March 2007 , following a request from the Commission , the Centre developed an action plan to fight tuberculosis in the EU .
<en> This addresses the key cross-sectoral challenges we are facing today in tuberculosis prevention and control and strengthening epidemiological surveillance : ensuring prompt and quality TB care for all , developing new tools for diagnosis and treatment , decreasing the burden of tuberculosis and HIV co-infection , and addressing the threat of multi-drug resistance .
<en> However , the Commission cannot succeed in this challenge alone .
<en> The contribution from civil society to reach out to the most vulnerable , and the Member States ' commitment are key towards achieving our objective to support the global fight against this disease .
<sp>
<2en> ' The cause of death in the age of antibiotics ' is what a group of researchers called tuberculosis , a word which many of us thought had disappeared from everyday usage , but a disease which still kills a huge number of people .
<2en> Tuberculosis is the seventh most common cause of death in the world .
<2en> Unfortunately , the current situation is highlighted by the rise in the number of cases involving a strain of tuberculosis resistant to standard drug therapy .
<2en> Globally , there were 9.4 million new cases of tuberculosis in 2008 and 1.8 million deaths .
<2en> A person is infected by tuberculosis somewhere in the world every second .
<2en> We need to hear these figures stated as clearly as possible in an important forum of the European Union so that we can all realise as much as possible that this disease is still ravaging our societies and killing a large number of European citizens .
<2en> I come from a country which , unfortunately , features among the top places in the European Union in the dismal ratings for tuberculosis cases .
<2en> Although we can talk about a slightly downward trend in recent years and an increase in the percentage of people cured of chemo-resistant tuberculosis , the absolute figures remain alarming and they reflect a tragic reality .
<2en> We need to wage a consistent , integrated battle , based on the best possible planning , in order to keep this scourge under control .
<2en> We have to continue at European Union level the work we have done so far to ensure that in all Member States , we raise the level of detection of diseases , the level of access to adequate treatment , the quality of treatment monitoring and the quality of medical care given to patients .
<2en> We also need all governments to realise the importance of this battle and to work alongside social partners as effectively as possible in order to reduce the number of Europeans suffering from this disease which we thought had been banished in previous centuries .
<2en> Above all , we need to wage this battle together , as a family , without considering the differences between us , but helping each other to overcome this problem .
<2en> Ultimately , we are the European Union and our strength lies in unity .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the S & D Group . - Mr President , in this day and age , no one should be dying from TB .
<en> ( SV ) That is what Ban Ki Moon said today , on World Tuberculosis Day .
<en> He is right , of course .
<en> Nevertheless , very many people around the world are still dying of tuberculosis today , particularly the young and the poor .
<en> We therefore need to increase our aid to the global fund that is responsible for a very large proportion of the work to combat tuberculosis , malaria and HIV in the poorer areas of the world .
<en> However , as the Commission pointed out , people in Europe are also dying of tuberculosis .
<en> We need to increase our cooperation to stop the spread of multi-resistant TB and to find effective treatments which reach all of the vulnerable groups in society .
<en> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , based in Solna in Sweden , has a very important role to play here and I am pleased that the Commission has made it a priority to come here and hold a debate on this important subject today .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , medical progress has not yet overcome tuberculosis .
<2en> Consequently , it is wrongly considered to be a disease that affects only poor countries .
<2en> This underestimates the way in which it is spreading , especially in Central and Eastern Europe .
<2en> In truth , no country is safe from this dreadful disease , which has been around for many thousands of years .
<2en> Furthermore , the multiple-resistant strains offer little hope of an end to this scourge in the short term .
<2en> The need to fight on several fronts by means of prevention , medical supervision , research and the dissemination of precautionary and hygiene measures encourages us to act in a coordinated and determined manner .
<2en> In short , we must be able to rely at all times on the best possible strategies in this area .
<2en> When it comes to financing the measures , it is advisable to distinguish between two scenarios .
<2en> Firstly , the social security systems in our countries should , in principle , be able to guarantee sufficient medical cover .
<2en> However , patients in developing countries still rely on solidarity which , since 2002 , has materialised in an exemplary fashion under the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
<2en> If the aim is indeed to halve the number of cases of tuberculosis between 2000 and 2015 , one of the three scenarios put forward by the President of the Global Fund , Michel Kazatchkine , will have to be endorsed .
<2en> I should like to ask the Commission which of the three scenarios it is using as a basis for making proposals to our Member States regarding the future financing of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I supported this report , since I think that it highlights at length the problems of the euro area and public finances .
<2en> There has been a further decline in employment in European Union Member States and it is forecast that this will continue .
<2en> The chaotic structural reforms of some Member States , which are implemented without a concrete plan , threaten the stability of the entire EU .
<2en> Small and medium-sized enterprises are going through a particularly difficult period , since both the Member States and the European Central Bank were unable to control and ensure that funds earmarked for the banks were allocated for the main goal - the provision of preferential loans to small business .
<2en> It is also very important to support the development of the euro area and to take appropriate measures to create suitable conditions for Member States aiming to become members of the euro area .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances .
<2en> I support the proposal made in the report , calling on the Eurogroup to facilitate entry into the euro area for those Member States wishing to join and meeting the specified conditions .
<2en> I think that it is vital to improve the regulation and supervision of the financial markets , as well as limit external and internal deficits in order to facilitate the successful development of the Economic and Monetary Union .
<2en> Furthermore , we must pay particular attention to the problems associated with fiscal discipline .
<2en> The future EU 2020 strategy must consider policies for creating jobs and promoting sustainable development so that we can prevent new economic crises from being triggered .
<2en> At the same time , Member States and the European Commission must work together to reduce fiscal imbalances .
<2en> The consolidation of public finances is a vital prerequisite for ensuring sustainable economic growth .
<2en> After the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Commission will play a bigger role in monitoring Member States ' economic development .
<2en> In accordance with Article 121 , the European Commission will be able to issue warnings to countries which fail to comply with the general guidelines on economic policies .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report since the European Parliament drew the Commission 's attention to the fact that while developed states are gradually climbing out of the pit of the global crisis , the situation in developing countries is only getting worse .
<2en> Therefore , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the European Commission and the euro area Member States must encourage the process of integration in the area of economic and monetary policy in the European Union and support the expansion of the euro area .
<2en> I am in favour of calling on the ECB to support the efforts of Member States outside the euro area to introduce the euro , especially in cases where Member States prove their ability to maintain reliable and stable fiscal discipline .
<2en> I would like to point out that , in order to avoid financial crises in the future , we must call on the Eurogroup , the Council and the ECB to better coordinate their actions in the area of currency exchange rate policy .
<2en> Therefore , in spite of the crisis , little progress has been made in the switch to a common international representation for the euro area .
<2en> The greatest concern is that in spite of the fact that every effort is being made to stabilise the area of monetary and fiscal policy , employment in the EU continues to fall and unemployment and social isolation are on the increase .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the Giegold report because there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues that arise in this report .
<en> It is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime .
<en> However , particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland , whose prosperity and employment levels depend , to a large extent , on its capacity to attract foreign investment .
<en> The Irish Labour Party does not support the introduction of CCCTB .
<sp>
<2en> I abstained from voting on this particular report .
<2en> We must see that the recession is not going away , given that the economic situation in almost all the Member States is clearly negative and unemployment is increasing .
<2en> The specific problem is not one of ' sound ' finances .
<2en> Countries such as Greece face problems with public borrowing due to both speculative attacks by the markets and the institutional and political problems of EMU .
<2en> The crisis in public deficits , which is a general phenomenon throughout the EU , is due , among other things , to the massive scale of tax evasion , which is something that the Commission forgets .
<2en> Apart from that , the support packages for the banks from national governments also increased public deficits , as the Spanish Presidency admitted in answer to my question on that point .
<2en> Be that as it may , insistence on the Stability Pact , especially in a recession , is a disaster .
<2en> It exacerbates social inequalities and results in cuts in public investment , it increases unemployment and it undermines countries ' growth prospects .
<2en> That is why the anti-growth and anti-social Stability Pact needs to be changed and a different framework needs to be configured for the exercising of economic and social policy , predicated on work and social needs and sustainable , viable growth .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The Court of Auditors is an institution that inspects the European Union 's receipts and expenses to verify their legality , as well as verifying good financial management .
<2en> It operates with complete independence .
<2en> Within this spirit , the appointment of the individuals of which it is composed must be governed by capability and independence criteria .
<2en> So , on the Council 's initiative , several individuals from various EU countries were put forward for the Court of Auditors .
<2en> They all submitted their curricula vitae , responded to a written questionnaire , and had hearings before the Committee on Budgetary Control .
<2en> The majority of them argued their cases well enough to justify their appointment to the Court of Auditors , where they will carry out their duties capably and independently .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I fully endorse these recommendations .
<en> I think that the EU 's strengthened external role should be used to enhance dialogue with key partners and to build a stronger EU .
<en> The EU and its Member States are significant contributors to the UN 's budget .
<en> In order to ensure that the Union 's values and interests are represented in a coherent and effective way in the UN system , it is necessary that the EU speaks with a single voice .
<en> The EU should play an active role in supporting the reform process of the UN system and especially , the reform of the Security Council .
<en> I believe that an EU seat in an enlarged Security Council should remain a goal of the European Union .
<sp>
<2en> The report with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly has been adopted today , 25 March 2010 , without a vote by the European Parliament .
<2en> We would hereby like to state that we do not support the wording in the report that states that the Council should be urged to propose innovative funding mechanisms , such as an international tax on financial transactions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I was in favour of the recommendation to the Council on the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly , which calls for strengthened EU visibility at the United Nations .
<en> The European Union needs to support and encourage global governance reform , particularly as regards the Security Council , whose make up does not reflect the realities of the 21st century .
<en> The ambition to gain an EU seat within an enlarged Security Council has to be pursued .
<en> If the European Union is to further multilateral approaches to global challenges , its Member States must act coherently and consistently at the UN level , particularly in light of the forthcoming review conferences for the Millennium Development Goals and the Non-Proliferation Treaty , as well as the review of the Human Rights Council 's status and working methods .
<en> We need to push for deeper involvement of national and transnational parliamentary assemblies in the works of the UN system , so as to strengthen its legitimacy and democratic nature .
<en> The Member States should make every effort to have this matter included in the Assembly 's agenda .
<sp>
<2en> At a time of serious social crisis , with increased poverty and unemployment resulting from the crisis of capitalism , this 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly becomes even more important .
<2en> There are many issues of interest at global level .
<2en> Of particular importance is monitoring progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals as minimum targets to be hit by 2015 .
<2en> Any attempt to reduce , weaken or postpone the promises made must be fought .
<2en> It is therefore important to attempt to reach agreement between developed and developing countries on speeding up progress .
<2en> This must include clear and specific commitments , as the international community is a long way off honouring its commitments regarding the Millennium Development Goals .
<2en> If appropriate measures are not taken , we could have nearly 1.5 billion workers in poverty because of unemployment or insecure and badly paid jobs .
<chp>

<en> ( SK ) I voted against this report because , as is often the case with other reports , in this own-initiative report , Europe again advances its own concept of so-called reproductive and sexual rights , which it forces on people in developing countries .
<en> It must be made clear once and for all that , according to the World Health Organisation definition , this concept includes abortion as a method of family planning .
<en> Human life is sacred from conception until natural death , and therefore I could not support this report .
<en> On the other hand , there are some good ideas there , which might , of course , help people in developing countries , and it could therefore be said that , as hundreds of millions of people in developing countries have to face the consequences of rising prices of basic products and foodstuffs , they will confront the problem of survival in these ways .
<en> I am alarmed by the estimates of international financial institutions that the billions of people already on the planet will increase by hundreds of millions more and that in sub Saharan Africa , child mortality will increase by between 30 000 and 50 000 .
<sp>
<en> ( GA ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the report on the effect the financial and economic crisis is having on the poor countries of the world .
<en> Although the report does not give a sufficiently radical response to the problems of poor countries , at the same time , we can agree with many of the things that it includes .
<en> It is poor people and poor countries that are suffering the most as a result of the economic crisis .
<en> We should give all the help we can with regard to public investment , particularly in these countries .
<en> However , it must also be said that the trade agreements the European Union has with poor countries are not really favourable to them .
<en> Large European companies benefit most from these agreements ; small producers , small farmers and working people do not benefit from them and , as such , we must change the way we work with these countries .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted against paragraph 7 of this report and I was disturbed to see , yet again , this Parliament using a report of this nature to covertly introduce the right to abortion and also the linkage of sexual and reproductive health to that of public health in developing nations .
<en> It is not for this place to determine whether access to abortion is a right or not .
<en> It is a matter for national governments to legislate .
<en> I , and the vast majority of my constituents in Northern Ireland , remain firm in the belief of the right to life of the unborn child .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , as Parliament , we ought to think twice before making proposals .
<en> We ought to be making proposals for policies that will solve problems , not exacerbate them .
<en> Now , as far as development aid is concerned , there are many serious studies that have actually demonstrated that granting development aid in too automatic a fashion invariably results in delays to economic reforms and thus in delays to opportunities for economic growth in developing countries .
<en> Despite this , we as Parliament keep taking as our starting point the credo or the so-called axiom that granting ever more development aid in the first instance will help get African countries back on their feet .
<en> Despite huge injections of development aid over so many decades , there is , regrettably , no clear evidence that most African countries are not in a far worse position today than immediately after decolonisation .
<en> That was my first point .
<en> I will be very brief with my second point .
<en> It is , of course , true , as the report states , that developing countries are further undermined by brain drain , but why do we keep on insisting on the ' blue card ' , which exacerbates this problem even more ?
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) I cannot understand why reproductive health has again been incorporated into a report on the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis for developing countries and development cooperation .
<en> Reproductive health organisations support abortion as one of the ways of controlling the birth rate .
<en> This industry is also financed at the European level from the taxes of citizens who oppose abortion and who are involved in protecting life .
<en> For decades now , international institutions have been giving their views on birth rate control as a way of combating poverty , but developing countries still live in extreme poverty .
<en> In my opinion , the EU wastes financial resources on birth control , which does not solve poverty .
<en> I honour life and I also respect the principle of subsidiarity in relationships with developing countries .
<en> That is why I have voted against paragraph 7 and against the entire report .

<sp>
<2en> The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was created in 2006 to provide additional support to workers who suffer from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
<2en> From 1 May 2009 , the scope of the EGF was broadened to include support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the economic and financial crisis .
<2en> At this time when we are facing this severe economic and financial crisis , one of the principal consequences is an increase in unemployment .
<2en> The EU must use all the means at its disposal to respond to the consequences of the crisis , particularly in terms of the support to be provided to those who have been facing the day-to-day reality of unemployment .
<2en> For these reasons , I voted in favour of this proposal on the mobilisation of the EGF to assist Lithuania , with the objective of supporting the workers made redundant in the 49 firms operating in the furniture manufacturing industry .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report , as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund 's ( EGF ) financial support will be allocated to the unemployed workers of companies in the furniture industry since , following the reduction in furniture industry exports , many workers were made redundant .
<2en> EU support will be earmarked to help workers requalify , search for new jobs or set up their own businesses .
<2en> I am delighted that the European Commission approved Lithuania 's application to receive EU funding since , during the recession , there is very little opportunity for the redundant furniture company workers to return to the labour market , and the mass redundancies from 49 companies is having a very negative impact on the country 's economic situation .
<2en> I would like to call on the EU institutions to ensure the smooth and swift adoption of decisions when considering matters concerning the provision of financial support , because the delaying of such decisions may only exacerbate the already difficult situation facing workers .
<2en> I would like to stress that financial aid from the EU will help workers who have suffered from major structural changes in the economy and trade to reintegrate into the labour market .
<sp>
<2en> Similarly to Lithuania 's construction sector , which we have analysed before , that country 's furniture industry has also felt the effects of globalisation , as it is now exposed to the products of vicious competitors , whose production is on another level .
<2en> As the requirements for application and mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund have been met , I think that such a mobilisation would be of help .
<sp>
<2en> Just two weeks after Parliament approved the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in response to the redundancies in Lithuania and Germany , we are once again approving its mobilisation , this time in response to the redundancies that have taken place in 49 companies in Lithuania 's furniture manufacturing industry .
<2en> As we said then , it has already been some time since the number of workers made redundant significantly exceeded the initial estimates of the Commission regarding the number of workers who would come to benefit from the fund .
<2en> We would remind you that this is an industry that has been struggling through serious difficulties in Portugal too , particularly in municipalities where it has an especially large presence , such as Paredes and Paços de Ferreira .
<2en> This has been leading to redundancies there too , exacerbating the region 's social situation .
<2en> With every new request for action , it becomes clearer that what are needed more than palliative measures - which are certainly necessary - are urgent measures to protect the productive sectors and jobs : specifically , those that are most vulnerable to the crisis and those that are involved in exploiting each country 's development potential , promoting public projects , and supporting micro , small and medium-sized enterprises and the cooperative sector ...

<en> in writing . - We are not in favour of the European Union being responsible for help to redundant workers ( or for anything else ) .
<en> We would oppose money being allocated to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as we would oppose money being allocated to all EU funds .
<en> We believe that Member States should help their own redundant workers .
<en> However , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has money that has already been allocated to it and that money has come from Member States .
<en> If it were proposed that money from the EGAF should be allocated to redundant workers in Britain , we would vote for it to be allocated and we would be criticised if we did not .
<en> We must therefore vote for the fund to be used appropriately for other Member States .
<en> Nevertheless , we intend to ensure that future money will be allocated to British redundant workers and , if we find that they are not eligible , we shall vote against all future mobilisations of the fund .
<sp>
<2en> It is the thought of the Lithuanian workers sacrificed on the altar of globalisation that prompts me to abstain .
<2en> As they have been plunged into this situation by the consequences of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union , one could feel justified in voting against the beggarly sums that the European elite want to give them .
<2en> However , what little is given may relieve their pain .
<2en> The logic of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is still intolerable nonetheless .
<2en> In the kingdom of Eurocrats , a clear conscience comes cheap .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Giegold 's report makes some interesting points concerning the current economic crisis , the worst since the process of European integration began .
<2en> I should like to emphasise that in a question I recently addressed to the Commission , I raised a question concerning the scope of the Stability and Growth Pact , which may be exceeded in certain exceptional cases , such as the implementation of public building and social housing projects .
<2en> Such works are , in fact , intended for social purposes and are a response to housing emergencies experienced in particular in large cities , and it might therefore be advisable to tackle this type of problem by resorting to exceptional measures .
<2en> I therefore consider it desirable for the Commission to adopt a very clear position so that it may issue directives in respect of the Member States with reference to budget and spending limits imposed by the parameters of the Stability and Growth Pact on local authorities , which , particularly in the case of large authorities , need substantial infrastructure investment .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report on the annual statement of the European Commission on the euro area and public finances .
<2en> What I recall , above all , from this report , which is rich in analysis and proposals , is its call for enhanced European economic governance and , in particular , for better coordination of budget policies .
<2en> Growth and solidarity : those are the two key words that must guide our European economic strategy .
<2en> Growth , because , without it , we will be unable to take up the social challenge .
<2en> Solidarity , because it is the raison d 'être of European integration and will be its future .
<sp>
<2en> The Fianna Fáil members of the European Parliament , Pat the Cope Gallagher and Liam Aylward , strongly oppose what is proposed in this report regarding the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base ( CCCTB in English ) .
<2en> A Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base in Europe would not improve the competitiveness of the European Union or the operation of the single market and , on top of that , the CCCTB could interfere with small open economies , like that of Ireland .
<2en> The question of taxation is within the competence of the individual Member States and the Irish Government has the right to use its power of veto in relation to any tax measures , including CCCTB .
<2en> This right is enshrined in the treaties , including the Treaty of Lisbon .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I share the rapporteur 's opinion regarding the need to create deeper and closer ties of biregional cooperation between the European Union and Latin America .
<2en> Nevertheless , I believe that the EU has to pay particular attention to one of the Latin American countries whose huge population , economic potential and position as a regional leader already demand it .
<2en> I am talking , obviously , about the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world : Brazil .
<2en> Commission communication COM ( 2007 ) 281 , of 30 May , explicitly recognised that ' EU-Brazil dialogue has not been sufficiently exploited and carried out mainly through EU-Mercosur dialogue .
<2en> Brazil will be the last " BRICS ” to meet the EU in a Summit .
<2en> The time has come to look at Brazil as a strategic partner as well as a major Latin American economic actor and regional leader . '
<2en> While the other European institutions are doing their duty , the European Parliament resists forming a relationship with this great country except through Mercosur , making it the only one out of Brazil , Russia , India and China ( BRIC ) in which the European Union does not maintain a separate parliamentary delegation .
<2en> The correction of this anachronistic and regrettable situation is urgent .
<sp>
<2en> The biregional strategic partnership contributes to further coordination between the EU and Latin America within international forums and institutions .
<2en> As well as setting a common agenda it should continue to coordinate positions on matters of global importance , taking account of the interests and concerns of both parties .
<2en> That is why I voted for the communication from the Commission ' The European Union and Latin America : Global Players in Partnership ' , which seeks to identify operational proposals aimed at the full implementation of the biregional strategic partnership .
<sp>
<2en> This report does not give consideration to the real problems that are being experienced in Latin America and does not set out the essential points that should be included in the EU strategy for relations with Latin America .
<2en> For example , it glosses over all the economic and social problems that will result from the signing of free trade agreements , and it accepts the normalisation of relations with Honduras as an incontestable fact , ignoring the coup d 'état and the still recent murders of members of the Resistance Front against the coup .
<2en> It ignores the situation in Colombia : the crimes of the paramilitaries , and the persecution of trade-union members and politicians are not problems worthy of any mention .
<2en> It does , on the other hand , criticise Bolivia and Venezuela , although it never makes explicit reference to these countries .
<2en> However , it says nothing about the redeployment of the United States Fourth Fleet in the region , the plan for the United States to use seven Colombian military bases , or the intervention operations that are undertaken from military bases in the territories of EU and NATO countries .
<2en> Regrettably , the majority of the proposals that we made on the aforementioned issues were rejected , so in the end we voted against the resolution .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report with one reservation , which is also a hope : that we will find a solution to the deep-rooted ' tango bond ' situation that casts such a shadow over our relationship with Argentina .
<2en> The determination to promote relations with Latin American countries could pave the way to resolving the whole issue of European investors ' rights , in an appropriate manner .
<sp>
<2en> This text , which is of an arrogant and imperial nature , is not acceptable .
<2en> It endorses the resumption of free trade agreement negotiations with Central America , Colombia and Peru .
<2en> These negotiations are harmful from an economic and social perspective as much as a democratic one .
<2en> How can we negotiate with Porfirio Lobo Sosa 's putschist government in Honduras and then claim to be guardians of the rule of law and human rights ?
<2en> How can we negotiate bilaterally with the oppressive governments of Álvaro Uribe and Alan García and flout the opinion of other sovereign states , members of the Andean Community , Bolivia and Ecuador ?
<2en> I vote against this text , which is in breach of the principles of democracy and humanism .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The penalty systems in the Member States of the European Union show wide disparities , and therefore the legal position with regard to international transport operations has become very hard for undertakings and especially for drivers to understand .
<2en> The regulations and the directive on social rules in road transport currently in force afford the Member States a great deal of scope for interpretation and this results in a failure to achieve uniform transposition into national law in the Member States .
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon provides for an opportunity to approximate the provisions of criminal laws and other legislation of the Member States .
<2en> I believe that the Commission must use this opportunity to develop and promote such harmonised approaches to checks and take regulatory action so as to remove obstacles to the European single market and improve road safety .
<2en> In order to ensure , as effectively as possible , the implementation of the social rules in road transport , the European Commission should come up with a uniform and binding interpretation of the Regulation on driving and resting hours , which the national inspection bodies should take into account .
<sp>
<2en> Since 2006 , a European regulation has obliged all road hauliers driving in Europe to respect the same maximum daily driving limit and to take rest periods in order to guarantee safety on European roads .
<2en> Unfortunately , the way these measures are being applied is far from optimal : the penalties for an infringement are completely different in each Member State .
<2en> Thus , the fine imposed on a driver who exceeds the maximum daily driving limit by more than two hours is ten times higher in Spain than in Greece .
<2en> In some Member States , a prison sentence may be applied for serious infringements , while in others , the driving licence is simply withdrawn .
<2en> This lack of harmonisation undermines the effectiveness of the regulation and introduces considerable legal uncertainty for road hauliers .
<2en> I voted for Mrs Ranner 's report , which calls on the Commission to propose minimum and maximum sentences for infringements that would be harmonised in all the Member States .
<2en> The report also calls for the creation of a simple and accessible information brochure to inform lorry drivers of the risks they run should there be an infringement .
<sp>
<2en> The European Union 's concern about the absence of a uniform system for regulating road penalties at Member State level is justified .
<2en> The enforcement of such penalties , at least non-financial ones , on all car drivers in Member States would lessen the confusion experienced by many hauliers or individual drivers as a result of legislative discrepancies between the country of origin and a third EU Member State in which they are driving .
<2en> On the other hand , the European Commission and specialist parliamentary committees are right when they say that it is too early for us to even contemplate standardising the financial penalties applied to traffic offences .
<2en> The European Union shows significant discrepancies in terms of the economic situation of companies and the population , which means that fines imposed for the same traffic offence cannot be the same across the board in all Member States .
<2en> However , standardising the regulations applied to passenger transport would place greater responsibility on transport companies .
<2en> Harmonisation of the regulations across all Member States , supported by their strict enforcement , without leaving it up to each Member State whether or not to adopt the European recommendations , would also increase safety on Europe 's roads .
<sp>
<2en> Infringements are a serious problem in road transport , which poses significant questions as regards border crossings .
<2en> It is therefore important for the Commission to consider the situations in the various Member States , as well as what constitutes an offence in the different national legal systems and the respective penalties and fines .
<2en> On this subject , the rapporteur argues ' that an effective , balanced and dissuasive penalty system can only be based on clear , transparent and comparable penalties across the Member States ' and ' calls on the Member States to find legislative and practical ways of reducing the , in some cases , very substantial differences in the type and level of penalties applied ' .
<2en> I tend to agree with the importance of an effective and balanced penal system , and that the Member States should work together to reduce the differences in how road infringements are handled .
<2en> However , I have greater difficulty in thinking that the national legislator should be losing authority on criminal matters in favour of harmonisation at Union level regarding the nature of penalties and the value of fines .
<sp>
<2en> The report prepared by the European Commission summarises the various types of penalty existing in Member States and demonstrates the differences between the systems adopted by each Member State in this area , concluding that the situation is unsatisfactory .
<2en> It therefore calls on the Member States to apply the social rules in road transport in a harmonised way .
<2en> The European Parliament 's rapporteur is proposing to increase harmonisation efforts in this area , particularly at the level of ' interpretation of the application of social legislation ' and penalties , by ' categorising ' it and so seeking to ' achieve an internal market in transport and to increase legal certainty ' .
<2en> Road safety is , without doubt , an important matter , as is improving working conditions in the road transport sector , not least driving times and rest periods .
<2en> We would reaffirm that these objectives are not necessarily achieved through generic harmonisation .
<2en> Harmonisation is indeed necessary , but through progress and not by everyone dropping down to the same low level , as has been common practice where attempts have been made ' to achieve an internal market ' .
<2en> Increased road safety is necessary , as are improved working conditions in the transport sector .
<2en> This will ensure better road safety in each of the Member States .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr Goebbels ' report stresses the importance of the international monetary system for those who use money to attempt to boost their economy .
<2en> I voted for the report but I was unsure about one thing : I remembered that Neapolitan shoeshine , that penniless Neapolitan boy who , when he met a wealthy old industrialist in Ischia , was told : " When I was your age , I used to clean shoes instead of sitting here sunbathing .
<2en> Then I bought a taxi , then a public transport firm and then an airline , and then I became the owner of a satellite network . "
<2en> " And what are you doing now ? " asked the boy .
<2en> " Now I am sitting here , sunbathing in the sun of Italy and Ischia .
<2en> " And I , " replied the boy , " what am I doing ? ! "
<sp>
<2en> The Goebbels report on how to avoid international monetary crises is , on the whole , accurate , reliable and reasonable .
<2en> We are simply surprised that the report does not mention the euro once and that it does not reiterate the ( very serious ) argument that has been put forward before , whereby the euro , which is soon to become a major international currency , would control the dollar by forcing the US monetary authorities to abandon their policy of ' benign neglect ' .
<2en> It is true that the dissident analysts believed , on the other hand , that a dollar / euro bipolar ( or tripolar , if you count the yen ) international monetary system risked being more unstable than the previous unipolar ( or bipolar ) system .
<2en> At any rate , this was an interesting debate , which should have fallen completely within the scope of the Goebbels report , having the added advantage of experience on its side , since the euro has been in circulation for almost three years , on the international currency markets at least .
<2en> Yet , the rapporteur carefully avoids this question .
<2en> Why is this so ?
<2en> Simply because the theory of the euro having a stabilising effect , like that of the euro having a destabilising effect , was based on the same hypothesis , namely that the euro was to quickly become the second international currency , next to , if not equal to , the dollar .
<2en> This is far from being the case .
<2en> Not only is the euro not a major currency , but its value has depreciated , it is permanently on the verge of a crisis of confidence , and its international role is not progressing .
<2en> And , on top of that , we are heading towards unavoidable problems between the Member States !
<2en> If the European Union had not obeyed those with dogmatic views , if we had gradually developed the ECU whilst respecting the national currencies , the process would have been safer and more straightforward .
<2en> To sum up , the experience of the last three years confirms what we always believed : a wrong move in European monetary unification will actually make life much easier for the dollar .
<2en> In spite of the recent attacks , the good health of the latter also seems to be further evidence of this .
<2en> We understand why the rapporteur does not wish to dwell on the subject .
<sp>
<2en> Following Mr Goebbels ' excellent report , a motion has been tabled in the European Parliament that is too narrowly framed from the outset .
<2en> Moreover , the Commission ' s representative expressed a position on its behalf , that is , firstly , false and , secondly , unacceptable , as it does not mention all the abuses now being committed other than terrorism , such as the international financing of the drugs trade and corruption .
<2en> Finally , a majority in Parliament , either inattentive or complacent , rejected many constructive amendments , including the creation of an Economic and Social Security Council , the need for better representation of all continents in global financial institutions , and the need to restrict financial transactions with Member States and off-shore centres which do not abide by even minimal international regulations .
<2en> Parliament has even refused to declare that ' financial speculation is one of the major causes of international financial instability ' .
<2en> When democratic parliamentary institutions refuse to acknowledge the evidence , they cease to serve the common good .
<2en> The reason that I abstained was in order to highlight this , as I did not wish to counter the few positive effects that can still be found in the resolution after the report has foundered .
<sp>
<2en> As the report points out , between 1975 and 2000 , the world has gone through some 120 monetary crises , which the IMF defines as depreciation of a currency by more than 25 % in the course of a year .
<2en> Regrettably , however , even in the knowledge that every such crisis involves enormous costs for the countries involved , as happened in the Asian crisis in the summer of 1998 , the report offers no basic measures that could prevent the emergence of new crises with any degree of effectiveness .
<2en> Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows an enormous increase in international financial activity , which practically doubled in the 1990s , with trading on stock exchanges appearing increasingly disconnected from the real economy .
<2en> This , combined with an increase in the speed of circulation in the financial sphere has heightened instability , thereby helping to increase the gap between richer countries and developing countries .
<2en> Despite the report ' s considerations and criticisms , specifically regarding the lack of democratic accountability of the IMF and its use by the USA and the G7 , does not offer much by way of an alternative .
<2en> On the contrary , it suggests from the outset that it is unrealistic to expect the creation , in the foreseeable future , of a United Nations organisation that would exercise full universal powers of regulation and supervision , when this is precisely the path that should be promoted and pursued in order to achieve fair and democratic international relations that provide solidarity and are concerned about development and the fight against poverty .
<2en> Although it is to be welcomed that the rapporteur acknowledges that starting from scratch on growth and on combating poverty will require cancelling the debts of the poorest countries , it is disappointing that he does not put forward any other practical proposals , such as a Tobin-type tax or abolishing tax havens and that the majority in this House has rejected every move in that direction .
<sp>
<2en> The Goebbels report sets itself the ambitious goal of how to make the international monetary system work better .
<2en> But for whose benefit ?
<2en> We are entitled to ask this question , when the rapporteur believes that ' the IMF is the only institution concerned about the smooth operation of the world economy ' .
<2en> The victims of its structural adjustment programmes will be delighted to hear this , and will not be particularly convinced by the request to the IMF to henceforth allow for ' social aspects ' .
<2en> It is also significant that the report chooses to disregard any tax on speculative movements ( Tobin style tax ) and the need to abolish tax havens .
<2en> However , I did not vote against the report , in order to support two specific requests , which we see as fundamental .
<2en> We are in favour of eliminating third world debt and we therefore support cancelling the debt of the poorest countries and introducing a standstill procedure for the others .
<2en> In this spirit , this procedure should not produce a restructuring plan , but should enable us to cancel an illegitimate debt .
<2en> In spite of all these reservations , these proposals are heading in the right direction and I do not wish to stand in their way .
<sp>
<en> That concludes the explanations of vote .

<sp>
<en> The next item is the report by José Manuel Fernandes , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the Commission Green Paper on the management of bio-waste in the European Union .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to salute and thank all those speaking about this report , which resulted in a large majority in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety : 55 votes for , 3 against and no abstentions .
<2en> I am grateful for the work and involvement that has made its content possible .
<2en> Bio-waste accounts for approximately 30 % of urban solid waste .
<2en> More than 100 000 tonnes are produced each year .
<2en> We must not forget that waste is responsible for more than 109 million tonnes of greenhouse gases .
<2en> It is the fourth most important source of greenhouse gas emissions , after energy , industry and agriculture .
<2en> Bio-waste should be viewed as a potential resource .
<2en> Bio-waste should be used to its full potential .
<2en> Unfortunately , up to now , large amounts of waste have been deposited in landfill and this has had environmental costs .
<2en> The legislation on this is non-cohesive .
<2en> We have legislation that is in various legislative texts and which requires harmonisation , legislation that requires and imposes clarity - another type of clarity - and greater simplicity .
<2en> That is why we are advocating a specific directive ; a directive that brings with it certainty and legal security for public and private investors , whilst respecting local specificities and the principle of subsidiarity .
<2en> However , this directive is essential .
<2en> In this report , we obviously advocate the hierarchy of waste and , not least , prevention , which must be viewed in a broad way .
<2en> The best waste is waste that will never become waste .
<2en> That is the reason why the public has options , for example , to ensure that gardens where there is a lot of greenery or which require a lot of maintenance and produce a lot of waste are viewed differently , in order to prevent this quantity of waste from being produced .
<2en> The same applies to the food industry , where packets of food are often wasted and thrown out because their expiry dates have lapsed .
<2en> Raising public awareness and moving towards a society that recycles is fundamental to increasing employment .
<2en> For every 10 000 tonnes of recycled waste , 250 jobs can be created , while depositing the same amount in landfill only requires 10 jobs .
<2en> Waste is important when combating climate change .
<2en> It is important to combat soil degradation by creating high quality compost - we also advocate the regulation of this compost by the European Union - and such waste is important in producing bioenergy .
<2en> We advocate making the remedy fit the results .
<2en> For example , scientific research into compost is encouraged in order to encourage innovation .
<2en> In the end , we are advocating a strategy for 2020 of sustainable , intelligent and inclusive development .
<2en> This is a report that is ambitious , but also realistic , because we want , for example , selective waste collection to be compulsory , provided it is possible from a local , economic and environmental point of view .
<2en> This is why I used the phrase ' we advocate ambition , but also realism ' .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I would like to express my thanks for this report , and also to say that bio-waste should not be treated as a problem or as something which pollutes the environment and has an adverse effect on the economy .
<en> Huge potential lies dormant in the appropriate use of these by-products .
<en> Proper management of bio-waste enables us to produce renewable energy , and this will contribute to economic growth , restrict climate change by an appropriately managed recycling process and help combat the process of soil degradation thanks to the use of bio-waste to produce high quality compost .
<en> Of course , to create a suitable infrastructure for this purpose and to encourage businesses to conduct research and introduce innovative measures , appropriate financial outlays are essential .
<en> The costs incurred will , nevertheless , contribute in the future to a strengthening of the economy and an improvement in citizens ' quality of life , so the game is worth the proverbial candle .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to compliment Mr Fernandes on his report .
<en> It could not be more timely , because right across the European Union , the citizens at large are now getting to grips with what is happening to our world , the effect of climate change and especially how they individually can make a difference .
<en> It has taken a long time for that message to get through , but you can see it in schools : in my own country , more and more schools are now getting the green flag .
<en> The message from this is spreading out to their parents and the environment and there is much greater care as regards how they deal with issues , recycle waste and so forth .
<en> It can also be seen in agriculture : for example , farmers realise the damage that too much fertiliser causes , and they are now cutting back .
<en> I think now is the time to move and to help people ensure that they can make a contribution to the development of anaerobic digesters and so on , and , as other speakers have said , to the development of job creation for the new economy .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) I would like to congratulate Mr Fernandes for his work as rapporteur for the report on biogas in 2007 .
<en> Biological waste is a natural by-product of agricultural production and forest management .
<en> This is why I do not agree with the rapporteur , as manure is an organic element of livestock farming .
<en> I am asking Mr Šefčovič to confirm what Parliament requested in 2007 , namely , that the Commission should dedicate resources to biogas production .
<en> This would be very important .
<en> Composting , also mentioned by my fellow Member , Mr Kalinowski , is equally or even more important .
<en> Mr Fernandes ' report states that the European Commission should provide funding for biological waste composting .
<en> As mentioned earlier , this is an essential endeavour for agricultural and environmental protection reasons , and it is equally important to acknowledge that new Member States face serious difficulties where biogas and composting are concerned .
<en> Please take into account the particular situation of each Member State .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) Agriculture is and will remain a strategic sector for the European Union economy , which will need to face up to the future challenges and guarantee independence and food security for Europeans through its common policy .
<en> I voted in favour of this particularly important report because I believe that in the forthcoming programming period the common agricultural policy will require support from a consolidated , well-structured budget , commensurate with the challenges which lie ahead of us .
<en> I think that we must establish close links between rural development policy and regional policy in order to ensure a degree of consistency with interventions of the same kind carried out in a particular region , thereby fostering territorial cohesion within the European Union as well .
<en> I also believe that it is essential to consider regions ' territorial features and priorities .
<en> We must promote common norms and objectives , taking into account the specific nature of each region .
<en> This will enable us to achieve dynamic , multifunctional and sustainable agriculture in Europe .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy after 2013 because I feel that the European Parliament , endowed with new powers since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , is clearly demonstrating through this excellent report that it is assuming its new responsibilities .
<2en> Parliament is in favour of maintaining a common agricultural policy worthy of the name , including after 2013 , with a budget that is at least equal to the current budget , in order to ensure high-quality production and security of supply in the 27 Member States .
<2en> I am delighted that my amendments along these lines have found their place in this text .
<2en> My call for us to maintain certain market measures acting as a safety net for farmers and the prices of their products has also largely been supported .
<2en> We must be able to prevent overproduction crises , among others , in order to safeguard farming activity in all European regions .
<2en> It is also advisable to retain specific tools to manage the production potential that some sectors have .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Lyon report on the future of the CAP , and in particular for retaining the two pillars .
<2en> Today 's vote in plenary on the Lyon report is very important and symbolic , since the MEPs are the first to take up a position and present their proposal for the CAP after 2013 .
<2en> I have every confidence in Commissioner Cioloş to take account of the results of this vote in the proposals that will be presented by the European Commission in November .
<2en> The main priorities of European agriculture , such as food security , market regulation and spatial planning , are clearly reaffirmed , as are the consequences in budgetary terms , which must be in line with the ambitions of the CAP .
<2en> The biodiversity support measures must not be forgotten .
<2en> Biodiversity must be at the heart of the CAP provisions , since its protection is no longer a luxury where the conservation of species and habitats is concerned .
<sp>
<2en> The 2009 crisis showed the weaknesses of the system of measures to support agriculture .
<2en> Its effects were felt in farmers ' income , which suffered a 12 % reduction on an income which is already around 50 % lower than the European Union average .
<2en> The strategic plan for the post-2013 period must be proportionate to the importance of the sector , which employs around 30 million workers .
<2en> It must include the strengthening of the common agricultural policy , an appropriate fiscal policy and maintenance of its budget , in consideration of the many beneficial effects of agriculture on the environment , health and climate change .
<2en> It is important to guarantee reasonable consumer prices and a fair income for farmers by using targeted aid .
<2en> Agriculture must have a greater role in the EU 2020 strategy , and plans must be set out for intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth .
<2en> Market instability grows with increasing measures to guarantee the safety and sustainability of products because this situation places European producers at a competitive disadvantage in relation to imports .
<2en> It will be difficult to ensure reasonable consumer prices and fair remuneration unless stricter rules to guarantee respect for the principle of European preference are introduced .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The European Parliament has increased powers under the Lisbon Treaty , specifically in the area of agriculture policy .
<en> With extra powers come responsibility , and the endorsement of the Lyon report on the future of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) post 2013 shows the Parliament taking its responsibility seriously .
<en> We recognise that the CAP must be maintained , that there must be an adequate budget and that food production is part of the bundle of ' public goods ' which farmers provide and must be rewarded for .
<en> We voted to hold on to the two-pillar structure .
<en> Market support measures are recognised as being an important part of the CAP .
<en> We have rejected any attempts to renationalise the policy .
<en> The report calls for a move away from the historical payment system by 2020 , calling for an area basis plus objective criteria to replace the current regime .
<en> The Commission must come forward with ideas in this regard - but caution is required .
<en> The Lyon report allows for national flexibility in aligning the CAP to meet local , regional and national needs , including the need for the option to re-couple for specific reasons .
<en> Our first priority is to safeguard the budget - when this is achieved we can begin to really debate the detail .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) I endorsed this report .
<en> However , I would like to say I am in favour of retaining partial intervention in agricultural markets in difficult situations .
<en> This is not inconsistent with free market principles .
<en> We must give more attention to the development of rural areas , expansion of infrastructure , educational affairs and the demographic situation .
<en> The number of young farmers continues to fall , while we have increasing numbers of older farmers .
<en> The conditions and standard of living on farms and in rural areas are significantly lower - much lower and much worse - than in urban areas .
<en> Furthermore , the incomes of farming families amount to around 60 % of those of families who support themselves by other means .
<en> Farmers have held protests about this .
<en> In summary , we should aim for the sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas .
<sp>
<en> ( LV ) Thank you , Mr President .
<en> I support this resolution because it emphasises several preconditions for the future of the common agricultural policy which deserve support .
<en> It stresses that financing for the policy must be preserved for at least the next long-term financial period .
<en> Secondly , it requires that direct payments to farmers be fully financed from the European Union budget .
<en> Thirdly , it refers to securing fair competition , which is currently the most significant thing that is lacking from the provisional common agricultural policy .
<en> Although my country , Latvia , has now been a Member State of the European Union for a considerable time , our farmers receive approximately EUR 90 per hectare in subsidies , whereas Greek farmers are paid approximately EUR 550 , and German and French farmers above EUR 300 per hectare .
<en> These destructive discrepancies distort competition and the whole European Union market .
<en> What is more , they widen the gap between new and old Member States , ignore the principles of cohesion , delay their implementation and hamper countries ' economic development .
<en> The new policy must be framed fairly , with support of equal value , so as to eliminate destructive discrepancies and ensure fair competition throughout the European Union .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , I have to say that I voted in favour of the Lyon report .
<en> On a few points I had what I might call national reservations , or I voted a bit differently .
<en> We have to realise that , although this proposal of Mr Lyon 's is an excellent and comprehensive one for agriculture and its reform in the European Union , the common agricultural policy is not in every respect directly suited to every situation - I speak as someone from a small nation , Finland , where the conditions for engaging in agriculture are very different from those the large Member States , such as France and Germany .
<en> That is why I introduced a few derogations when I voted .
<en> I hope that in future the European Parliament and the Union can pay greater attention too to the small-scale agriculture , the small countries and the agriculture practised there , because agriculture , in a way , is a national life assurance policy .
<en> Every Member State needs its own agriculture and has to ensure that it is preserved .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted against the Lyon report because all over Europe governments are cutting their budgets .
<en> In the United Kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pensions .
<en> Police numbers are being cut and prisoners are being released because we cannot afford to keep them in prison .
<en> Yet here in the European Parliament representatives of the Conservative and Liberal parties that make up the UK Government somehow find it within themselves to vote to retain farming expenditure up to 2013 and beyond 2013 at 2013 levels .
<en> I find that entirely unacceptable .
<en> I find it wrong that the agricultural community should be ring-fenced in a way that no other section of society is .
<en> If it is right for public servants to face reductions in their income , then it is right for others in our society to face the same reductions .
<en> The Government in the UK and governments across Europe are saying we are all in this together .
<en> If we are in it together , we all have to feel the pain together .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I think one can understand why , when the political leaders of Europe saw their war-ravaged countries at the end of the Second World War , they wanted to promote the idea of food security and the common agricultural policy .
<en> However , if you look at the policy 60 years later , let us look at the cost to the EU citizens .
<en> Let us look at the fact that citizens pay three times : once in tax to pay for the bureaucracy , once in tax to pay for subsidies , and then the higher prices that they have to pay in their shops .
<en> Surely , rather than talking about the reform of the common agricultural policy , we should be looking to abolish it .
<en> Scrapping the CAP would allow efficient farmers to thrive .
<en> It would allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money and deploy that money more usefully , and it would allow consumers lower prices .
<en> Reform is not enough - it is time to scrap the CAP .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The European Social Fund ( ESF ) is the instrument par excellence that allows the creation of new employment and job opportunities , the promotion of the adaptation of workers ' skills to the demands of the labour market , and workers ' integration into the labour market , along with reinforcing social inclusion .
<2en> It is therefore vital for the European Union to achieve the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy in the field of social and employment affairs .
<2en> Thus , the strengthening of this important instrument is essential for us to bring the outlined strategy properly to fruition , reinforced by support for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , which are the driving force behind the whole economy and primarily responsible for economic and technological development , as well as the creation of jobs .
<sp>
<2en> In Latvia , European Social Fund funding has become the object of political and economic speculation .
<2en> Certain dishonest civil servants are enriching themselves from funds earmarked for training and reskilling .
<2en> Newly established training centres and other unlicensed institutions are simply ' laundering ' money earmarked for the training of the unemployed and other low-income groups , while the qualifications of trainers are often below the necessary standard .
<2en> The fees charged by certain ' training centres ' are higher than those of the University of Latvia .
<2en> The European Social Fund has to pay for this negligent state of affairs .
<2en> I supported this resolution .
<2en> I was particularly struck by Paragraph 15 , in which the European Parliament ' calls on the Commission to strengthen the structural funds ' potential through simplification , flexibility and improvement of procedures ... with the aims of helping Member States to optimise the output of social and employment policies and creating sustainable growth ' .
<2en> I voted ' for ' in the hope that a monitoring mechanism that would crack down hard on dishonest political operators may be set up .
<sp>
<2en> Attempts are being made to reduce economic and social differences between the Member States using the European Social Fund .
<2en> In this regard , beginning with qualification measures is much more forward-looking in the interests of job security and job placement for European workers .
<2en> We need to make full use of the potential that we already have so that trade and industry cannot import huge numbers of cheap foreign specialists on the pretext of there being a lack of skilled workers .
<2en> In this connection , the various ' cards ' that are being considered should also be rejected .
<2en> However , if the bringing to account and execution of projects leads to problems in many regions , and if the French PPP training programme , for example , has been waiting for payments for three years on account of a change in competences within the Brussels bureaucracy , the fund is failing in its mission .
<2en> In any case , we need to make it clear that more attention needs to be focused on small and medium-sized enterprises as the ' true ' employers .
<2en> As this resolution essentially agrees with these considerations but contains a few shortcomings , I abstained from the vote .
<sp>
<2en> We have voted today , in plenary , on a motion for a resolution on the future of the European Social Fund .
<2en> As is well known , the European Social Fund plays a key role in supporting the Europe 2020 strategy , the principal objective of which is to achieve inclusive growth , a reduction in poverty , an increase in employment and a rise in training levels with the ultimate aim of creating new and better jobs .
<2en> Seen in this light , the primary importance of the fund as a policy tool and its double value , in supporting employment policy and cohesion policy , on the one hand , and in real and harmonious regional development , on the other , can be understood .
<2en> This last aspect - and I conclude - is of particular importance in that Europe cannot be said to be truly complete , cohesive and united if all the communities of which it is comprised are not truly developed and have not reached a level of growth that is both steady and uniform as far as possible .
<2en> In particular , we must not forget the regions of southern Europe - the mobilisation of funds for the regions of eastern Europe , right and proper as it may be , must not be carried out at the expense of those regions that are the heart and soul of Europe .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We have supported the text which , among other things , notes the key role played by the European Social Fund ( ESF ) in improving employment and job opportunities , promoting the adaptation of workers ' skills to the demands of the labour market , and workers ' integration into the labour market , and reinforcing social inclusion .
<en> It draws attention to the four employment guidelines adopted by the European Parliament and welcomes the fact that the objectives include promoting employment and combating poverty in the context of integration / reintegration into working life through training .
<en> It also emphasises that substantive progress towards achieving the Europe 2020 targets and objectives , in particular , in the field of employment and social affairs , is essential if the strategy is to be credible .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The purpose of this text is to amend Directive 2009 / 42 / EC to make the collection of data by type of goods mandatory for maritime transport statistics .
<2en> Currently , 18 Member States voluntarily collect that data .
<2en> Five Member States do not have a coastline and do not supply the data provided for in the directive .
<2en> In the majority of cases , the collection of the relevant data will not place any additional burden on those who supply it , as the Member States affected should be able to compile the data using existing sources of information ( such as customs documents ) .
<2en> The collection of data by type of goods is already mandatory for European statistics concerning transport by road , rail and inland waterways .
<2en> European statistics on all modes of transport must be collected according to common principles and rules in order to ensure the highest degree of comparability between modes of transport , which is why I voted in favour of the text .
<2en> The availability of comprehensive and homogenous statistics by type of goods for all modes of transport would provide a useful general framework for supporting and supervising the policy promoting co-modality .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LV ) I fully supported Mr Simpson 's report .
<en> I agree that data on the breakdown by type of goods is necessary for maritime transport statistics .
<en> These statistics will offer exporters and importers the possibility of finding the best scheme for cargo transportation .
<en> This means that the cost of goods for the European population will fall , and that exporters will be able to charge prices for goods supplied from third countries more efficiently .
<en> This type of statistical data will help to avoid unforeseen costs and will stimulate the circulation of both internal and external goods .
<en> I would additionally introduce this sort of statistical data in relation to air freight as well .
<sp>
<2en> In order to be able to react , statistics are important , because they provide facts on which decisions can be based .
<2en> However , in the case of the collection of statistical data , it is always important to maintain a balance between the necessary collection of facts and the administrative costs .
<2en> Up to now , the data on the carriage of goods and passengers have been collected by 18 Member States on a voluntary basis .
<2en> This makes sense if the relevant data really do not impose any additional burden , in other words , if the Member States are indeed in a position to collate these data using already existing data sources .
<2en> The collection of complete statistics for the carriage of goods and passengers for all goods and for all modes of transport for the purpose of comparison seems excessive to me in terms of the administrative costs involved .
<2en> I have therefore voted accordingly .
<sp>
<2en> The report proposes a series of amendments which aim to adapt provisions on the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to the new provisions on delegated acts introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> The rapporteur 's aim was to introduce amendments to the EU directive on data collection by types of goods for maritime transport statistics .
<2en> At the moment , 18 Member States collect this data on a voluntary basis .
<2en> Five Member States have no maritime coast , and therefore do not provide the data required under that directive .
<2en> It is worth mentioning that the collection of the relevant data does not impose any additional burden on respondents , as the Member States concerned should be able to compile the data by using already existing data sources ( for example , custom documents ) .
<2en> The collection of data by type of goods is mandatory for European road , rail and inland waterways transport statistics .
<2en> Given the need to create effective , coordinated and eco-friendly communication and transport networks ( maritime , land and inland waterways ) , action with regard to the collection and analysis of data for all types of transport is indeed very relevant .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Simpson report because , by amending Directive 2009 / 42 / EC , it puts the finishing touches to the relevant legislation on the collection of data on the transport of goods and passengers from and within Europe .
<2en> Previously , data collection was mandatory only for road , rail and inland waterway transport , but with the amendment to the directive , it will also be mandatory for maritime transport , providing a series of data on goods entering and leaving across our borders .
<2en> Such data are essential not only for statistical purposes .
<2en> The implementation of the amendment to the directive will also provide data on maritime transport , starting next year , allowing greater transparency as regards the types of goods transported and making the transport of specific goods more efficient , since comparability will make it possible to find the most efficient means of transport for each kind of goods .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted against this European Parliament legislative resolution , because creating the service that they want to finance represents another step towards the militarisation of the European Union 's foreign policy .
<2en> As well as my opposition to this militaristic foreign affairs philosophy , my reason for voting against it is that the most basic principles of transparency and democracy have been absent throughout the process of creating the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
<2en> The organisation and financing of this service do not include the necessary strict control over staffing and financing by the European Parliament , meaning that the EEAS is worryingly lacking in democracy and transparency .
<2en> It is therefore no surprise that the proposed structure for the EEAS relegates the European Parliament to a secondary , irrelevant position in EU foreign policy , which my group and I firmly reject .
<2en> I have therefore voted against it .
<2en> I cannot be in favour of the proposed budgets for this type of service with its militaristic tendencies .
<sp>
<2en> In addition to the duplicated structures that will be created by the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , personnel costs will also rocket in the wasteful and bureaucratic way that is typical of the EU .
<2en> Of the 1 643 posts that the EEAS will start off with on 1 December , 50 are , believe it or not , director-general posts , and during the initial phases , there will be barely more than 30 members of staff under one director-general .
<2en> When the final structure is complete there will not even be as many as 80 .
<2en> The aforementioned directors-general will , on average , earn EUR 17 000 per month .
<2en> Below these directors-general , there is another level containing 224 directors and 235 heads of unit .
<2en> In addition , we are still waiting for specific tasks and objectives to be defined for the EEAS staff .
<2en> We want the EU to have a strong voice in the world , but this surely does not require a bloated administrative apparatus that will cost EU citizens billions as a result of duplicated structures and members of staff who will enjoy a very lucrative source of income .
<2en> I therefore voted against this report .
<sp>
<2en> In negotiations with representatives of the European Council and the Commission , Parliament and , in particular , negotiators from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats , managed to ensure that the budget for the EU 's new diplomatic service would be used more transparently .
<2en> Parliament will approve its budget discharge annually and the Commission will have to provide MEPs with detailed information about its expenditure on a regular basis .
<2en> I voted for this report because it underlines that when employing citizens of EU Member States , greater geographical coverage would be ensured along with proper and meaningful representation for the citizens of all Member States .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that we must aim to ensure that employees are chosen according to their abilities and also that gender equality is taken into account .
<2en> It is important for the European External Action Service due to be launched on 1 December to quickly become effective and to embody , above all , the EU 's interests and , where necessary , national interests .
<sp>
<2en> The European External Action Service ( EEAS ) will manage its own administrative budget and be responsible for it .
<2en> In fact , in establishing the new service , and particularly in drawing up its financial rules , it is necessary to provide the appropriate economic safeguards from the beginning .
<2en> Therefore , in order to promote their financial probity , it is important to ensure the smooth interaction of the various services responsible for supervision of financial matters , especially in EU delegations .
<2en> By means of strengthening these safeguards , we hope to enhance the confidence of European citizens in European institutions .
<2en> Consequently , the structural improvements presented in this proposal aim to impose the financial integrity necessary for trust in the smooth and unquestionable functioning of the EEAS .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - It has been a bumpy ride , but thanks to Parliament 's efforts , the EU 's External Action Service now has the potential to be the driving force for a more effective and more legitimate EU foreign policy .
<en> We welcome that key Green concerns - such as on gender balance and common training to create an ' esprit de corps ' - have been largely addressed , and that Parliament will have greater democratic scrutiny on the functioning of the EEAS , notably through the introduction of individual budget lines for the EU 's major overseas operations .
<en> The EP also succeeded in safeguarding the Community method and , thanks to Green pressure , development priorities .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> It is necessary to provide effective responses to current crises and threats to security , including natural disasters , so we often need to be able to draw on both civilian and military capabilities and require closer cooperation between them .
<2en> The development of the EU 's comprehensive approach and its combined military and civilian crisis management capabilities have been distinctive features of the common security and defence policy ( CSDP ) , and represent its core added value .
<2en> The establishment of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) is further contributing to the development of a truly comprehensive European approach to civilian and military crisis management , conflict prevention and peacebuilding , and providing the EU with adequate structures , staffing levels and financial resources to meet its global responsibilities , in line with the UN Charter .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted against the report on civilian-military cooperation and the development of civilian-military capabilities .
<2en> The report describes in great detail the current developments in security policy .
<2en> However , in my opinion , it does not provide clear , decisive and positive answers to the important questions , such as whether the EU will be able to stand on its own feet in the long term or whether it will maintain its very close links to NATO and , therefore , will hand over its foreign policy responsibilities to the USA .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - With civil and ethnic wars gradually replacing interstate wars to dominate the scene of 21st century conflicts , the line drawn between peacekeeping and peacebuilding is increasingly blurred .
<en> The changing nature of conflict calls for more extensive cooperation between civilian and military capabilities .
<en> The highly successful EU-led Aceh Monitoring Mission ( AMM ) from 2005 to 2006 serves as an important example and reminder of how civilian-military synergies can anchor peace and build confidence in an unstable environment in a timely and effective way .
<en> While the decommissioning team , dominated by military experts , monitored the rapid and successful disarmament process , the civilian team of AMM worked to turn the process into a platform for further political dialogue and for both parties to credibly commit themselves to permanent peace .
<en> The application of civilian and military expertise should not be restricted by the technical labelling of the nature of operations , but should instead be decided on the basis of appropriateness and cost-efficiency .
<en> I voted in favour of this report because I think it plays a critical role in facilitating the further development of a non-aggressive but nevertheless coherent and competent face of EU foreign policies .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Mr Ehler 's report because I believe that this is an important issue and that the report deals with it in a serious way and takes a number of aspects into account .
<2en> Cooperation as envisaged in the report is a typical activity of peacekeeping operations , within the scope of which the military component cooperates with the civilian component ( local authorities , national , international and non-governmental organisations and agencies ) in order to restore acceptable living conditions and begin reconstruction .
<2en> Such activities help to ensure and maintain full cooperation between military forces , civilian populations and local institutions , with the aim of creating the conditions necessary to help achieve the objectives set .
<2en> It is therefore important for the European Union to support and promote this type of cooperation .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report as I agree that , in order for the EU to meet its responsibilities to preserve peace , prevent conflicts , strengthen international security and assist populations facing disasters , it is vital to foster better coordination between civilian and military resources and to ensure that the necessary resources are available to strengthen their global crisis management abilities .

<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , aside from this issue , I should like to submit a problem to the Presidency .
<en> I think some people have not yet fully understood the role of the European Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> I feel I must point out an underlying problem here : the Commissioner for Transport , Mr Kallas , has repeatedly refused to meet with the board of the Sky and Space Intergroup to discuss the Cost-Effective Small Aircraft ( CESAR ) project , which affects everyone in terms of the economy , the environment and security .
<en> I would urge the Presidency to call Commissioner Kallas to this Chamber to explain the programme he intends to move ahead with in this sector , which is extremely sensitive and important for the European Parliament .

<en> ( HU ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the two-thirds majority government in Hungary launched an offensive against democratic institutions in the past six months .
<en> In this process , they abolished the former parity-based media supervisory body , and set up in its place one consisting of delegates of the government party .
<en> The so-called media constitution recently adopted in Hungary also gives the government the possibility to censor certain websites if they so choose , even along the Chinese censorship model .
<en> The president of the media authority , Annamária Szalai , proudly boasted of this in an interview .
<en> As an example , she mentioned the most widely read right-wing news portal , www.kuruc.info , which , due to the anonymity offered by the Internet , was in the lead in exposing the infringements committed by the former government .
<en> I ask the European Parliament and the Commission to urge Fidesz to put an end to the anti-democratic processes currently taking place in Hungary as soon as possible .
<en> All that is left for the Hungarian opposition is the power of the public eye , and now they intend to deprive us even of that .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , more than a month has passed since Asia Bibi , a Catholic peasant woman from Pakistan , was convicted of blasphemy .
<en> We cannot fail to remember the importance of protecting inviolable human rights , amongst which we count , in our Charter of Rights , freedom of expression .
<en> In countries such as Pakistan , the charge of blasphemy has already led to the deaths of 46 people in the last 10 years , fuelling more and more religious intolerance and , hence , Islamic fundamentalism .
<en> These people were all killed outside prison following the charges of blasphemy , or were found dead in prison .
<en> Asia Bibi 's life is at risk , not only through the application of Pakistani law , but also at the hands of fanatics .
<en> Pakistani law therefore fuels this climate of persecution and unjust deaths .
<en> To conclude , I urge the entire international community to make strong calls for the law on blasphemy to be abolished from the Pakistani criminal code and to ensure that anyone convicted of crimes which restrict freedom of expression is released as soon as possible .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today is the launch date of a declaration signed by myself and four colleagues calling for the equitable distribution of agricultural subsidies among the old and new Member States after 2013 .
<en> Under the current common agricultural policy , all farmers in the European Union have to meet the same obligations , which entails costly investments .
<en> However , while their obligations are equal , their entitlements are not .
<en> I therefore believe that as from 2013 , the direct payments system must guarantee the fair treatment of all farmers throughout the European Union .
<en> We must put an end to the historical model , define common criteria and take on board the specific needs of agriculture in individual regions .
<en> In addition , we need to build up a system allowing funds to be transferred from the second to the first pillar so that a greater proportion of agricultural producers in the new Member States can benefit from support measures and instruments .
<en> It is time to put an end to the way the CAP separates the old from the new Member States , and it is my sincere hope that you will all support this cause .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , the tornado that hit Portugal last Tuesday caused enormous damage in the region of Tomar .
<en> Unfortunately , this type of natural disaster is becoming increasingly frequent .
<en> It is important to make available emergency mechanisms that will enable rapid intervention to aid the affected populations .
<en> The role of the EU is vitally important , as it has mechanisms and instruments at its disposal , such as the Solidarity Fund , that are intended to respond to this type of problem .
<en> However , it is absolutely crucial for these mechanisms to be activated and applied in a way that is quick , flexible and simple .
<en> I therefore call on the Commission and Council to make the Solidarity Fund more flexible so that it can be applied as quickly as it should be in this case and in other similar ones .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , in the period prior to Romania 's accession to the European Union , the European Commission closely monitored the situation regarding international adoptions and recommended a halt to these activities following the disclosure of abusive adoption practices .
<en> However , in 2009 , in the context of the conference organised by the European Commission and Council of Europe on the subject of the challenges in adoption procedures in Europe , I sent a letter to Jacques Barrot which I wanted to use to draw attention to the repercussions of reopening the international adoption market .
<en> I also called for the European Commission to be consistent .
<en> Following an investigation carried out by a Romanian newspaper , we are presented with the possibility that an abuse of power has been committed by the European Commission , demonstrated by it imposing the conclusion of the conference 's official report , which recommends setting up a European Adoption Agency .
<en> I think that the European Union 's image will suffer as a result of the guardian of the European treaties being involved in falsifying an official document .
<en> This is why I am waiting for a clear , reasoned response from the European Commission , which will remove this question mark hanging over its vertical structure .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> At a time when we are facing ever more frequent natural disasters in Europe , the European Union must be able to provide appropriate aid to its Member States when one of them is hit by a disaster of this kind .
<2en> Consequently , following storm Xynthia in March , which hit the coastal areas of Charente-Maritime and Vendée , and the floods that affected the island of Madeira in Portugal in February , it was only natural that I should approve the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund in order to compensate for the damage caused by these disasters .
<2en> To my mind , this vote illustrates the solidarity that exists between the nations of Europe , and which should exist in many other areas too , for that matter .
<sp>
<2en> When faced with a natural disaster - and we are facing ever more disasters of this type - it is imperative that the European Union provide aid to Member States and regions which are grappling with the lasting effects of such tragedies .
<2en> The EU Solidarity Fund was established to precisely this end .
<2en> The fund makes it possible to grant financial assistance to victims in areas affected by ' major natural disasters ' , such as the Portuguese island of Madeira which was destroyed by floods , or the French regions devastated by storm Xynthia .
<2en> With the memory of this year 's floods in Poland and other parts of Europe still fresh in my mind , I concur with the proposal to grant support to the countries that have suffered , in solidarity with the thousands of citizens of regions affected by such devastating cataclysms .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report which approves the transfer of 66 million euro from the European offshore wind grid system to the EU Solidarity Fund in order to help the victims of flooding in Portugal and storms in France .
<sp>
<2en> This draft amending budget makes sense , considering the purpose of the funds mobilised through the Solidarity Fund to address the effects of the landslides and severe flooding that took place on the island of Madeira , Portugal , and the effects of storm Xynthia in France .
<2en> After verifying that both applications meet the eligibility criteria of Regulation ( EC ) No 2012 / 2002 , the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to the tune of EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal ( flooding in Madeira ) and EUR 35 635 750 for France ( storm Xynthia ) , resulting in a total amount of EUR 66 891 540 to be deducted from the ceiling of EUR 1 billion in commitment and payment appropriations .
<2en> I would , however , like to highlight the delay in mobilising this type of support .
<2en> The procedure needs to be made less bureaucratic and more streamlined in order to respond to future disaster situations in a timely manner .
<sp>
<2en> An increase in the budget in times of financial and economic crisis should , in principle , be rejected .
<2en> In this case , however , it is a matter of an adjustment on account of storm damage in France and Portugal caused by storm Xynthia .
<2en> Mutual aid and assistance in the event of natural disasters is a true sign of active European solidarity and is therefore to be welcomed and supported .
<2en> For this reason , I have voted in favour of the report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the Commission is always pleased to assist Members of Parliament in forming their opinions .
<en> May I therefore say that if Mr Lehne had been present I would have said the following - and I am , of course , willing say it even though Mr Lehne is not here .
<en> Mr Lehne stated that social and environmental clauses must be introduced in the tender documents themselves and should not influence the choice at the award stage .
<en> Therefore , I would support his view that Article 53 on award criteria should not be modified .
<en> Such considerations may be taken into account at the appropriate stage , either in the tender documents or in the contractual clauses .
<en> I cannot support Amendment No 147 by Mr Zappalà , since it will not provide any legal certainty to economic operators .
<en> May I end my reply to Parliament here and conclude by saying that there is now a real need to ensure that our public procurement rules remain relevant to increasingly sophisticated procurement requirements .
<en> That is why Parliament and the Council must now press ahead to ensure that these directives are adopted at the earliest opportunity .
<en> Mr President , I am sorry for having spoken for fully half an hour , but I feel that Parliament is entitled to a complete response to the many amendments tabled .
<en> The Commission awaits the vote tomorrow .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in view of the importance of the matter , I would just like to ask the Commissioner to clarify something .
<2en> In any case , I would like to thank him for all his comments , which were certainly important from my point of view , although I do maintain - and I will do so tomorrow - that Parliament should have the autonomy to decide on a political basis rather than on the basis of other factors .
<2en> However , his response regarding Amendment No 147 does not make sense at all : while the Commission is against raising the thresholds - which , as was said during the hearings , meetings and debates within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I believe is because it wants the directives on works contracts to be applied as widely as possible - according to what the Commissioner has just said , raising the thresholds would actually reduce the number of works contracts .
<2en> Now then , Amendment No 147 seeks specifically to open up works contracts to competition , and I cannot understand why the Commission is opposed to this .
<2en> I would be grateful to the Commissioner if , either now or later in private , by some means or other , he could explain to me what part of Amendment No 147 is unacceptable .
<2en> It is important , Mr President , for this is no trivial matter .
<2en> I repeat , if it is not appropriate to do so now because it is time to suspend our work or move on to something else , I am quite prepared , if the Commissioner agrees , even to meet him afterwards so that he can explain to me what is wrong with Amendment No 147 , which , as I see it , ensures that absolutely all works contracts , of whatever type , can be governed by European legislation .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I shall try to be brief .
<en> Until 1971 the only rules and principles applicable to public procurement were those enshrined in the Treaty itself , and in particular the provisions of Articles 28 and 49 .
<en> However , experience has shown that the genuine opening up of markets and the creation of a real and efficient internal market required that those rules and principles be clarified through detailed provisions coordinating national procedures .
<en> To revert to the legal situation of the 1970s - and this would be the result of the proposal just made and enshrined in Amendment No 147 - is not acceptable , especially in a proposal aimed at modernising the legislation .
<en> Moreover , to do so would also deprive economic operators of one of the most important advances in the field of public procurement , namely the possibility of enforcing their rights through efficient legal remedies guaranteed through the two specific directives which govern remedies in respect of contracts falling within the scope of the public procurement directives .
<en> Therefore , the introduction of Amendment No 147 simply does not make the amendments aimed at raising thresholds throughout the directive acceptable .
<sp>
<en> There is still some misunderstanding .
<en> I believe we can find a bilateral means of solving this .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , I wish briefly to say three things .
<en> Firstly , I believe , counter to what has been said , that the European Union ought to have its own strategy .
<en> In Afghanistan , we have men , soldiers , troops who are engaged , we have resources , considerable resources that we have provided and we need to have our own view on matters .
<en> Secondly , I believe that it is absolutely necessary for the international community 's money to benefit the Afghans .
<en> This , unfortunately , has not been the case for 10 years , and it is something that we can witness on a daily basis on the ground .
<en> I think that this is probably in part the responsibility of the NGOs and the humanitarian organisations .
<en> However , and the report possibly does not state this sufficiently , it is also largely due , I fear , to government corruption and to a government which , it must be said , is neither very fair nor very effective .
<en> Thirdly , there is the question of political dialogue .
<en> Indeed , there have been attempts to engage in this with the Taliban for a number of years .
<en> This is not new .
<en> I personally believe that dialogue is necessary .
<en> However , I believe that it will be very difficult because to hold a dialogue at a time when we are in a position of weakness on the ground and the withdrawal of troops is at an advanced stage , will , of course , be very complicated .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , now that the several amendments have been approved , we agree with Mr Arlacchi 's report and with the priorities that were highlighted in the report for the future development of Afghanistan .
<en> In particular a transparent financial aid system , the training of domestic police forces , the fight against drug trafficking and the coordination of international aid are the main points of political and military strategy that have been further strengthened .
<en> It is important to stress again the need to ensure control and stabilisation of the area in order to weaken the action of Taliban forces and revitalise peace processes .
<en> I conclude by emphasising the contribution that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) has made to achieving a shared text and I would also like to pay homage to the efforts and sacrifice of the soldiers of the International Security Assistance Force for their presence on the ground in the defence of freedom and the local populations .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) Madam President , in my opinion , armies cannot bring peace and prosperity , and this also applies to Afghanistan .
<en> We should give some thought to the fact that while some of our fellow Members , chiefly from the EPP , worry about whether we will support a certain type of aircraft - I am no military expert and have no idea what this debate is about - then I believe we should pay far more attention to what Mr Arlacchi is talking about in this report , as it is very important .
<en> He is talking about the situation of women and children in that country .
<en> We should definitely focus more on supporting non-discrimination against women and the fight against discrimination .
<en> We should also focus on the fact that many children in Afghanistan do not have the opportunity to go to school , for example , and many are living below the poverty line .
<en> In my opinion , if we fail to support projects on education and health , and if we continue to invest in military solutions to this conflict , we will get nowhere .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , Mr Arlacchi 's report is well researched and informative .
<en> My slight criticism is that he seems to bemoan the fact that Afghanistan is not a liberal democracy run by a coalition of Greens and Liberal Democrats in Brighton .
<en> The horror story of Afghanistan has involved the deaths of 346 British soldiers , many more allied soldiers and thousands of innocent Afghans .
<en> During that period , infant mortality and maternal mortality have soared and life expectancy has fallen .
<en> He tells us than in 2001 no poppies were being grown in Afghanistan , whereas now , after nine years of conflict and allied influence , Afghanistan supplies more than 90 % of the heroin in Europe .
<en> To point out that there is some discrimination against women is to get things slightly out of proportion .
<en> The answer is to support our troops by stopping the war and bringing them home to guard our own people against home grown but imported terrorists .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Madam President , while both women and children are undoubtedly an important topic , what is important , however , in Mr Arlacchi 's report is its clarity .
<en> I mean by this that it presents the legitimacy of the international intervention in Afghanistan to us and does not question it .
<en> However , it is a natural and politically responsible step to discuss the effectiveness of this intervention .
<en> The reason is that , sentimentality aside , an intervention lasting 10 years can cast a complete shadow over the effectiveness of the political decision taken on this issue .
<en> I believe that each one of us is responsible to those who elected us for coming up with an answer to this question .
<en> I welcome the clarity of this report also because it mentions matters which we generally avoid discussing for a variety of reasons .
<en> I believe that it is a report which merely provides a starting point .
<en> We must have the courage to carry out a regular analysis and evaluation of our actions , admit where we have made mistakes and , when we have made them , we must find other solutions .
<en> This is what acting both responsibly and democratically is all about .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - UKIP believes that the best reaction to a humanitarian disaster is for independent nation states to coordinate their aid efforts voluntarily , and not to have them set centrally by the undemocratic EU .
<en> We note the debacle of the EU 's slow and small efforts in Haiti , and thus we feel that the EU cannot be trusted in future humanitarian crises .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because the European Union is the world 's largest donor of humanitarian aid , contributing more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
<2en> In 2009 , it granted humanitarian aid to approximately 115 million people in more than 70 countries , to a total of EUR 950 million .
<2en> Through its humanitarian policy , the European Union has demonstrated its commitment to supporting people in situations of extreme vulnerability in third countries .
<2en> I agree with the mid-term review of the humanitarian consensus as I believe that it is vital to make an effort to increase its visibility among Member States , the other institutions and military players .
<2en> I would urge the Commission to redouble its efforts in reducing disaster risk , and to pay attention to the ever increasing violations of international humanitarian law and to the most vulnerable groups , such as women , children and people who have been forcibly displaced .
<2en> It is also important to encourage dialogue between the political , military or humanitarian bodies active in the same working environment , along with the creation of a European rapid reaction capacity , namely , a European civil protection force .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the report on humanitarian aid for two reasons .
<2en> Initially , because it insists on linking civil protection and humanitarian aid with the European External Action Service and its foreign policy , whereas , obviously , intervention criteria should be clearly humanitarian and humanitarian alone .
<2en> Also , because I do not believe that linking civil and military capabilities in order to deal with humanitarian crisis situations is a move in the right direction .
<2en> Obviously , particular knowledge and the use of special equipment , which has always been owned and used by the military , are needed in certain circumstances .
<2en> Therefore , in order to preserve and safeguard the purely civil character of humanitarian missions , civil protection could be financed so that it has such specific equipment and , of course , so that civil protection workers can be trained , rather than keeping up all this military spending .
<2en> It is the only way to provide real and effective help in humanitarian crises without facing the dangers of a military presence .
<sp>
<2en> While carrying out the mid-term review of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid , I cannot fail to point out that it is regrettable that public awareness of it has not been at the desired level and that the Member States have played little part in implementing it .
<2en> However , instead of finding fault , we must promote and set out the path that we should be following as regards humanitarian aid .
<2en> The humanitarian situation has changed a fair amount in recent years , with natural disasters , more displaced persons , the multiplication of various internal conflicts , food crises , etc .
<2en> More than ever , there is an urgent need for a balanced and effective global reaction that is based on specific needs , is results-oriented , and is guided by the principle that saving means of subsistence is saving lives , whilst considering the involved areas ' need for self-development and self-sufficiency .
<2en> To achieve this , it is crucial for the Consensus to promote these humanitarian values , and for various players to optimise resources .
<2en> Once again , I would argue that there is an urgent need to create a European Civil Protection Force following the Barnier report of May 2006 .
<2en> I would congratulate my colleague , Mrs Striffler , on the positive content of the proposals she has tabled , and I would reiterate my position that the Consensus is an essential instrument , with every relevance to the current situation .
<sp>
<2en> The Humanitarian Consensus is a key instrument which especially shows its worth in the current humanitarian context of profound change .
<2en> We have witnessed the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters caused mainly by the impact of climate change , the increasing incidence of complex crises , especially internal conflicts , as well as the changing nature of conflicts , many of which entail the displacement of huge numbers of people .
<2en> Violations of international humanitarian law are increasingly common .
<2en> One particularly shocking aspect of such violations is the increasing use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
<2en> I support the rapporteur 's position and I think that strong measures are required to increase protection against acts of sexual violence in humanitarian circumstances .
<2en> I concur with the position of the report 's author , indicating that the recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan have demonstrated once again the need to improve the EU 's disaster-response capability in terms of effectiveness , speed of response , coordination and visibility .
<2en> I also support the creation of a European rapid response capability ( European civil protection force ) .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> In this sitting , following an amended proposal by Parliament and the Council , Parliament has analysed a draft legislative resolution on mergers of public limited liability companies ( codified version ) , having adopted the proposal tabled by the Commission .
<2en> Given that the proposal is simply aimed at the ' straightforward codification ' of the legislative texts without any change in their substance , along with the improvement of working methods , and bearing in mind that it incorporates the forms suggested and substantiated by the Consultative Working Party of the legal services , I am voting in favour of this proposal as I recognise that it will translate into a significant improvement in the functioning of public limited liability companies , particularly by modernising and streamlining them .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because , according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance and therefore , in the interests of clarity and rationality , the existing texts should be codified .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report because , according to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , the proposal in question contains a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance .
<sp>
<2en> Carrying out codification in order to maintain clarity after a certain number of amendments certainly makes things easier .
<2en> In general , however , we need to consider whether such a multitude of rules and regulations is necessary at all .
<2en> In some areas , it is excessive and consumers are scarcely credited with common sense any more , while in other areas , the prescriptions include the likes of name changes for foodstuffs .
<2en> In order to protect the interests of shareholders and third parties , coordinating the laws of the Member States covering mergers of public limited liability companies is a suitable way to ensure the observance of information rights .
<2en> I find myself unable to vote in favour of some of the amendments and I therefore voted against the report as a whole .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report , given that it is confined exclusively to codifying existing texts on mergers of public limited liability companies .
<2en> On 21 September 2010 , the Consultative Working Party , made up of the respective legal services of Parliament , the Council and the Commission , having examined the proposal for codifying the Third Council Directive 78 / 855 / EEC of 9 October 1978 based on Article 54 ( 3 ) ( g ) of the Treaty concerning mergers of public limited liability companies , concluded without dissent that the proposal is effectively a straightforward codification of existing texts , without any change in their substance .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this resolution on the Interim Partnership Agreement between the EC and the Pacific States in the hope that this agreement - which is currently limited to two countries : Papua New Guinea and the Republic of the Fiji Islands - could prepare the ground for a wider-ranging agreement .
<2en> Such an agreement would be an instrument for promoting the Pacific Region 's sustainable social and economic development , for reducing poverty , and for strengthening regional integration and cooperation , in line with the Millennium Development Goals .
<sp>
<2en> The Interim Partnership Agreement between Papua New Guinea , the Republic of the Fiji Islands and the European Community was initialled on 14 December 2007 .
<2en> These were the only countries of the Pacific Region to enter into the agreement as they were the most active in maintaining trade relations with the European Union , and mainly because they were interested in protecting their sugar and tuna industries .
<2en> The agreement should also guarantee these countries further gains , thanks to a new regulation on duty- and quota-free access to markets .
<2en> By having better access to the European market , these countries will also benefit from new investment opportunities , which will also have a positive impact on employment .
<2en> The economic partnership agreement provides for an ad hoc committee to be set up subsequently to monitor its implementation and to check its effects on local society and the local economy at regular intervals .
<sp>
<2en> The resolution explains Parliament 's doubts about the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement .
<2en> It points out the objectives of the agreement ( development , strengthening of trade links between the EU and the Pacific ) and underlines the problems raised by the derogation from the rules of origin for processed fishery products .
<2en> That is why I voted for this resolution and why I supported the amendments tabled by the Greens , which are entirely consistent with our concerns .
<2en> I am looking forward to the European Commission supplying us with the impact assessment provided for by the agreement , and I shall be keeping a close eye on the negotiations on the final partnership agreement .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I supported this Interim Economic Partnership Agreement with Papua New Guinea and Fiji as it is important to develop strong links with exporting countries in the Pacific Region .
<en> Despite concerns from some Members , I believe that we need to foster closer cooperation with these countries as this allows the EU to monitor catches of tuna and other fish that are canned on Papua New Guinea .
<en> This industry has also created hundreds of jobs for local people in the impoverished country .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that this helps to establish new trade arrangements that are compatible with World Trade Organisation rules with the Republic of the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea .
<2en> Interim Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) are agreements on the trade of goods that are intended to prevent a breakdown in trade between the countries of the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and Europe .
<2en> Although interim agreements may be seen as a first step in the process , in legal terms , they are completely independent international agreements which do not necessarily lead to a full EPA .
<2en> I welcome the recommendations regarding the signing of definitive agreements , the origin of EU funds to finance these agreements , which should not come from the European Development Fund , the need for a parliamentary committee to monitor the implementation of the agreement , and a review clause envisaging a global impact assessment in three to five years .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , sometimes we are the victim of our own working methods .
<2en> If we had had just one asylum directive regulating the procedures , assessment criteria and reception , we would have had only two options : either to adopt the directive , with or without amendments , or face the failure of the negotiations .
<2en> Such a scenario would have enabled us in the European Parliament to say ' no ' to a common asylum policy and ' no ' to a system modelled on the Dublin Regulation .
<2en> However , the reality is different .
<2en> We have a whole range of directives .
<2en> The Council has the option of giving priority to one directive , while considering another too controversial .
<2en> Before long , we will end up in a situation where we will , indeed , be able to negotiate a new Dublin Regulation , but still have reached no agreement over asylum procedures or reception , for example .
<2en> Let us think through what the implications of that might be .
<2en> If that were to happen , we would be making Member States responsible for examining asylum applications , without having any guarantee that those applications would be properly examined or asylum seekers taken care of in a humane way .
<2en> I find that totally unacceptable , especially given the current situation .
<2en> I therefore have this question for the Council and the Commission : how are you going to ensure that you rescue the Asylum Procedures Directive from the doldrums without sacrificing quality ?
<2en> You will soon receive a number of proposals from Parliament on how the directive might be improved .
<2en> Will you try to convey to Member States the clear signal which the MEPs have sent out and will you dig your heels in , should Member States insist on an à la carte approach ?
<2en> By way of conclusion , I would like to clarify one point .
<2en> I made no reference in my question to the costs of the asylum procedure .
<2en> I omitted them , not because I was unaware of that issue , but because humane treatment of asylum seekers is paramount for me .
<2en> That requires a neat process and proper arrangements for reception .
<2en> If we fail to regulate that properly , then I will no longer have any desire to work on the other sub-initiatives .
<2en> I hope that I have the full support of the European Commission on this , in particular .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( HU ) Thank you , Mr President , for your kind words .
<en> Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , I would like to thank Parliament for giving me the opportunity to talk about the very important issue of asylum application procedures this evening .
<en> Parliament addressed five questions to the Council , and since they all deal with the Commission 's proposal for a recast of the Asylum Procedures Directive , I suggest we debate these five questions as one .
<en> In your questions , you referred to the September 2010 Commission report on the application of the Asylum Procedures Directive .
<en> This report confirms that considerable differences continue to exist between Member States in terms of asylum procedures and procedural guarantees .
<en> The Council and the European Parliament agree that this does not conform to our mutually accepted goal of creating a common European asylum system .
<en> In October 2008 , the European Council adopted the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum , which stressed that the EU and its Member States are committed to addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by migration and asylum in a fair , effective and coherent way .
<en> Among other things , the Pact contains a specific commitment to taking the necessary initiatives for completing the establishment of a common European asylum system .
<en> The European Council therefore invited the Commission to submit proposals for the creation of a single asylum procedure containing common norms .
<en> The Stockholm Programme also set out clearly that , in the context of the creation of a common European asylum system , increased harmonisation must remain one of the fundamental policy objectives of the EU .
<en> After the European Council had thus given the process political impetus , the Commission submitted multiple proposals in the field of asylum policy , both in 2008 and 2009 : Eurodac , as you mentioned earlier in the introductory debate , the proposal for the amendment of the Dublin Regulation or the proposal for the amendment of the Reception Conditions Directive ; similarly , the proposal for the establishment of a European Asylum Support Office ; and lastly , the proposal for the amendment of the Asylum Procedures Directive and the Qualification Directive .
<en> After these had been received from the Commission , the Council immediately set to work .
<en> In this stage , the Council and its preparatory bodies subjected all proposals to intensive and meticulous examination .
<en> To this date , the only proposal that Parliament and the Council managed to adopt out of these was the Regulation establishing a European Asylum Support Office , and I am pleased that the Office will soon commence its operation .
<en> Last year , Parliament and the Council also agreed on the amendment of the Long-Term Residents Directive , which I believe will give significant momentum to further work on a common European asylum system .
<en> Unfortunately , as you are absolutely right to complain , progress in other areas has proven more difficult .
<en> I am certain that you are fully aware of the political sensitivity and technical difficulties of the issue .
<en> In this we , the Council , and , I believe , Parliament as well , will all need more time .
<en> As you have very accurately pointed out in the questions submitted , the proposal for a recast of the Asylum Procedures Directive contains a particularly high number of problematic issues .
<en> Parliament , too , is in the progress of forming its position , which is a good indication of the complexity of the process .
<en> It is clear that there remain considerable concerns within the Council with regard to several issues related to the proposal .
<en> These especially concern the issue of the potential effects of the proposed measures on the costs of national asylum procedures and the effectiveness of such procedures .
<en> You have yourselves mentioned earlier this evening that we must indeed pay special attention to effectiveness and costs .
<en> The Member States firmly support the harmonisation objectives with a view to reaching an agreement on certain common fundamental norms and values and uniform protection criteria .
<en> As such , the Member States are committed to fully respecting asylum seekers ' right to protection .
<en> However , the Member States wish to make their systems sustainable , especially considering the current difficult economic situation .
<en> In order to achieve this , the guarantees provided to asylum seekers and the rules , which must be effective and enforceable and must not result in increased administrative or financial burdens , must be balanced .
<en> The Council in general is convinced that if we fail to strike an appropriate balance in this regard , those who do not need protection at all , as Mrs Hohlmeier has already mentioned , will be motivated to abuse the asylum system .
<en> Such abuse may harm those asylum seekers who are in real need of protection and , in the long term , could jeopardise the issue of asylum in the European Union .
<en> In this context , the Commission 's announcement that it intends to submit an amended proposal has gained extensive support in the Council , as I think the Commissioner will elaborate shortly .
<en> I am certain that this new proposal will give new momentum to the debate in the Council , ensuring that this new proposal will reflect the opinions of the Council and Parliament as well .
<en> We will thus be able to make progress in the matter of the proposal on asylum procedures , which is , as you have correctly pointed out in the questions submitted , an important element of the asylum package .
<en> To this I must add that , in response to the Commission 's announcement , the Member States have firmly expressed their readiness to lend their assistance to the Commission in drawing up the new proposal .
<en> In this context , please allow me to point out one more aspect .
<en> A more accurate estimation of the costs of examining the applications submitted would be facilitated if we had such an estimate , which would enable us to conduct an appropriate debate in the Council .
<en> I must unfortunately inform you that we in the Council possess no such information .
<en> In accordance with the Treaties , the examination of asylum applications falls under the competence of the Member States .
<en> The collection and ordering of information relating to the costs of examining asylum applications is not a task the Treaties confer upon the Council .
<en> Therefore , as a representative of the Council , I cannot make a commitment in this debate , either speaking for myself or on behalf of the Council , to make available the information in question .
<en> However , the Council , of course , remains committed to continuing its work on the proposal for the amendment of the Asylum Procedures Directive , and I would like to thank you for the work you have done so far , and I am confident that the Commission will incorporate the observations you have made so far in the new proposal .
<en> We are counting on the commitment and expertise of the European Parliament .
<en> The Hungarian Presidency is confident that , through proper cooperation , we will be able to make progress in this area as well .
<en> Please note that it is the goal of the Hungarian Presidency to prepare the common European asylum system that is scheduled to be created in 2012 .
<en> You , too , have mentioned here several laws in connection with which we definitely wish to make progress .
<en> We intend to reach a political agreement in the discussion on the Qualification Directive , as well as in the field of the Dublin Regulation , before the end of the Hungarian Presidency .
<en> We will do everything in our power to increase harmony between Parliament and the Council on issues related to the procedure as well .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Asylum Procedures Directive is an essential element of the common European asylum system .
<en> It is the aim of the Commission to establish a system that is balanced , fair , efficient and cost-effective .
<en> Financial impact is a critical aspect of every Commission proposal and is assessed thoroughly .
<en> The Commission carried out extensive research at the time of the preparation of the Asylum Procedures Directive proposal , in line with the requirements on impact assessment .
<en> The evaluation of financial impact was mainly based on statistical information and data obtained from Member States through the comprehensive questionnaires sent out by the Commission .
<en> Only a few Member States could identify the full cost of asylum procedures .
<en> Others provided certain elements , mainly on the costs of legal assistance and interpretation .
<en> The Commission assessed financial implications on the basis of the available information .
<en> The Commission concluded that given , inter alia , the aim of reducing costs , an approach based on front-loading was to be preferred : i.e. investing resources in the early stages of the asylum procedure in order to make it faster , more efficient and fairer .
<en> Additional investments in the first-instance procedure improve the efficiency of the asylum process .
<en> Such investments are offset due to savings at the appeal stages and a reduction in overall reception costs .
<en> The choice of this approach was fully supported by the findings of a recent project in the UK , the so-called ' Solihull Pilot ' , presented at the ministerial conference on asylum in 2010 .
<en> This project confirmed the hypothesis that front-loading the asylum process - in particular , by providing access to competent legal advice for asylum applicants at the start of the procedure and allowing the legal representative to interact with the decision maker - leads to significant improvements in the quality of first-instance decisions .
<en> It resulted in much quicker decisions and a higher percentage of positive decisions at first instance , fewer appeals and a higher percentage of removals to countries of origin .
<en> It was possible to reduce considerably expenditure on appeals and on accommodation and welfare .
<en> These savings considerably outweighed the additional legal aid costs .
<en> I would also like to remind you of the recent study , prepared by the European Parliament , on burden sharing between Member States for the reception of asylum seekers , which provides an analysis of costs of asylum procedures and reception , including legal aid .
<en> To conclude , the Commission has paid considerable attention to the cost element as part of the impact assessment .
<en> The findings have been confirmed by empirical evidence and the information has been complemented by the European Parliament study .
<en> Therefore , the Commission does not intend to prepare another study on costs .
<en> However , during the next stages of the negotiations on the Asylum Procedures Directive , the Commission will continue to be attentive to the cost aspects .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , there is no question but that the asylum package is currently blocked and this is a pity .
<en> It is an unfortunate situation and we should all do our best to unblock the situation .
<en> I can think of many reasons why the situation is blocked .
<en> First of all , we seem to have concentrated on new proposals when we all know that there is existing legislation which Member States are struggling to implement - and this has created an ill-at-ease feeling amongst Member States , because they are clearly not prepared to move on to new laws when they have difficulties with existing ones .
<en> Secondly , the new proposals feature and envisage new and much higher obligations and burdens which are , at times , unrealistic , especially in the current context , and which could also , as has been highlighted already , lead to abuse that should be avoided .
<en> Thirdly , there is indeed a lack of a financial assessment , of a study to determine costs , and I am afraid I have to disagree with you , Commissioner : I do not think that the study carried out by the European Parliament on burden sharing is about the costs of these proposals .
<en> In any case , it is a job for the Commission to study the financial implications of its own proposals .
<en> Furthermore , there is no proposal on a proper , legally binding burden-sharing mechanism and this , too , creates difficulties for a number of Member States , and indeed for this Parliament .
<en> Finally , the Council is still stonewalling on proposals such as the review of the Dublin Regulation .
<en> I am very happy to hear the Council say that the Presidency will pay close attention to this and increase the efforts to find a solution on the Dublin dossier .
<en> It is difficult .
<en> We are in a difficult situation and we need to get out of it .
<en> The EPP Group is still very much open to cooperating with the Council , and most importantly with other groups here in Parliament , to try and reach a compromise that is acceptable for all .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , all of the EU 's institutions have a deadline of 2012 when the common European asylum system is to be ready .
<2en> I have to admit that I have a feeling of both hope and despair about this .
<2en> Will we manage to do this or not ?
<2en> It is based on a common system for the reception of asylum seekers , the examination of applications and decisions concerning these people 's futures .
<2en> Once we have this system in place , it will be the same in all countries , which is not the case today .
<2en> There are currently huge differences with regard to how people are received in our various Member States .
<2en> From the report that Commissioner Füle just referred to , we know that it is a fact that there are large differences in how the Member States receive asylum seekers .
<2en> We also know that the costs decrease when we increase the quality of the first instance decisions .
<2en> We are currently working on amending the Procedures Directive , and it would therefore be very important for us in Parliament to be aware of the specific costs for different Member States when it comes to the asylum procedure .
<2en> I believe that , by carrying out thorough examinations , we will reduce the risk of mistakes being made and people getting into difficulties .
<2en> It will be interesting to see whether the Commission can come up with a more thorough procedure and demonstrate how we can reduce the costs of the reception of asylum seekers .
<2en> At the end of the day , this will perhaps be the decisive argument that Mr Busuttil referred to , in other words , the key to unblocking the situation with regard to the fixed positions that we see the Council taking .
<2en> I deeply regret the fact that the Council is so closed in this process .
<2en> We have been visited today by the Hungarian Prime Minister , who has taken over the Council Presidency , and I would now ask the Hungarian Presidency to continue the good work that was started while Belgium held the Presidency .
<2en> It would be unfortunate if this process should cease .
<2en> Together , we can indeed develop an operational asylum system that has humanity and consideration for our fellow man as key concepts , and we can do this by 2012 .
<2en> Let us continue to hope and work towards this being possible .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE Group . - Madam President , on behalf of the PPE Group , I urge the European Parliament to give the green light to this very important agreement .
<en> We believe that this will facilitate the Doha Round negotiations and also provide an impetus to our bilateral negotiations with the Mercosur countries on a free trade agreement .
<en> We welcome the overall trend towards liberalisation of the global trade in bananas , including the current WTO agreement , as well as bilateral agreements with the Central American and Andean countries , and possibly one day with Mercosur .
<en> The motion for a resolution - and I pay tribute for this to our rapporteur - is a well-balanced one , especially since we have taken into account the interests of our partners from the ACP countries , as well as local European banana producers .
<en> It is my deep conviction that , while we move towards greater liberalisation of the global trade in bananas , we should make sure that we do not wipe out industries or sectors that have traditionally played important economic and social roles in certain European regions , such as the Canary Islands , Guadeloupe , Martinique , Madeira , the Azores and others .
<en> Finally , we hope the Commission will take these concerns into account and will take steps to adjust the support package for domestic EU producers earmarked in the POSEI envelope and , if necessary , take other steps in order to ensure that , in parallel to the trend of liberalisation of the global trade in bananas , domestic EU producers are able to remain on the market and foster their traditional activities .
<en> A good opportunity to do that will be during the discussions on the next EU financial perspective .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we all know the meaning of ' banana republic ' .
<2en> It is a country in which the large banana-producing companies make and break governments at their will .
<2en> When governments inconvenience them by trying to retain minimum government rights or increase basic wages , they even use coups against them .
<2en> In these countries , the same companies continue to produce bananas .
<2en> The destruction of forests and the environment , the miserable working conditions and the use of pesticides banned in the European Union are daily occurrences .
<2en> At the same time , because of these multinationals , 99 % of the bananas we eat are one species , even though there are several thousand species of banana , and this species is at risk of a specific disease as a result of single crop farming .
<2en> The measures to support the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries were very important and reducing them would have a serious impact on producers in those countries .
<2en> These are very poor countries that need our help .
<2en> The European Union is , globally , the biggest and the most profitable banana market .
<2en> Over coming years , we shall indeed see these huge multinationals trying to gain absolute control of the EU market by ousting smaller producers , and this is honestly where we need to pay attention .
<2en> The Commission needs to be on the alert to ensure that European competition laws are complied with to the letter , so that we can prevent the large multinationals from abusing their dominant position on the market by artificially depressing prices to start with , in order to oust small producers , and then creating cartels and increasing prices , so that they become very expensive to European consumers .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , as regards the approval of the trade agreements in the banana sector , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance will vote against .
<2en> These agreements are aimed at opening up the banana market by strengthening the dominant position of the large US multinationals , which already control more than 80 % of the world market .
<2en> If we approve agreements of this type , we will be acting against the interests , in particular , of the ACP countries , the outermost regions and Ecuador .
<2en> Once again , small producers will be the ones who suffer .
<2en> There must be an urgent , radical overhaul of international trade rules to guarantee food sovereignty and the development of local production for all .
<2en> The financial measures proposed by the European Commission to support these producers are insufficient .
<2en> The European Union must not only ensure that an impact assessment is carried out in relation to these agreements ; it must also amend its legislation accordingly so as to promote sustainable production and sustainable economies .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , in my opinion , these agreements are not positive .
<2en> They provide a demonstration of how small banana producers , in the ACP countries and the outermost regions , have been taken hostage in the agreements concluded in 2009 in Geneva and in the Doha negotiations which are taking place today , agreements and negotiations which the World Trade Organisation desired and imposed .
<2en> It is true that the fate of small producers in the ACP countries and the outermost regions counts for very little given the powerful interests which are at stake - not only the interests of the Latin American giants , but also those of the European Union .
<2en> The reform of the banana market and the reform of the sugar market are basically expressions of the same inexorable shift towards a large global market , which , unfortunately , is crushing the weakest and most fragile .
<2en> Furthermore , Madam President , the compensation measures envisaged will not be enough to ultimately prevent the ruin that lies in store for small planters , nor to lead the ACP countries , which are some of the poorest countries around , towards genuine development .
<2en> In fact , we are being urged to sign these agreements in order to save the Doha negotiations .
<2en> If only our leaders were urged to show the same willingness to save global agreements aimed at the protection of the environment and the upwards harmonisation of workers ' rights and living standards .
<2en> If this were the case , then I believe that people would be much less hesitant about globalisation than they are today .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , this banana is the stuff of war - an EU-inspired trade war with America that has lasted 16 years and has now been lost spectacularly .
<en> The EU has now been fined nearly USD 200 million by the World Trade Organisation and been forced to drop its illegal tariffs - all because of the protectionism that lies at the heart of the EU , in this case protection of French colonies .
<en> May I say that this very banana which I bought today in the European Parliament supermarket is illegal !
<en> It does not conform to EU rules in terms of the length , the width and the straightness of bananas .
<en> What is going on ?
<en> With such barmy protectionism and such silly rules as this , one has to ask : is the European Union crazy or has it merely gone bananas ?
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this recommendation because I fully support its contents , particularly in terms of the desire to strengthen bilateral cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa .
<2en> Since this is , above all , an economic and commercial agreement , the amended text supports the economic and social transition process in the Republic of South Africa , promoting regional cooperation and providing fresh impetus to the country 's economic integration into the global economy .
<2en> Partly as a result of my institutional roles , I think it is a priority to strengthen political dialogue with this country , particularly with regard to issues of specific interest for African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) States .
<2en> In particular , I support the decision to direct a large portion of the EUR 980 million available to the EU for the period 2007-2013 to the creation of new jobs , as well as financing the construction in South Africa of the necessary infrastructure to provide basic services in terms of health and security .
<2en> Pursuing these objectives with the real involvement of civil society means proceeding doggedly along the path to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and placing the eradication of hunger and all forms of poverty above all other goals .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this agreement as it will improve Europe 's trade and development relations with South Africa , which are critical for the South African region and also for us .
<sp>
<2en> 1999 marked the conclusion of the first Trade , Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Republic of South Africa , which came into force on 1 May 2004 .
<2en> This first agreement had a distinctly economic character , being based on trade liberalisation , and it left little room for development cooperation .
<2en> The review of this agreement , which was provided for therein , was concluded in 2009 , and introduced important changes in development policy , in particular , cooperation on issues associated with disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , the inclusion of the principle of the rule of law and human rights , the principle of aid effectiveness , particularly in matters concerning the fight against poverty , and achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
<2en> New areas were added in order to enhance cooperation : the fight against terrorism and organised crime ; the prevention of mercenary activities ; the fight against the manufacturing of , trade in and accumulation of small arms and light weapons ; and cooperation on migration .
<2en> I welcome the adoption of this agreement with a strategic partner of the EU and the institutionalisation of non-state actors as cooperation partners , thus making them eligible for financial aid .
<sp>
<2en> I supported the European Parliament 's recommendation to amend the provisions of the Trade , Development and Cooperation Agreement in the field of rights , freedoms and security .
<2en> I believe that it is important to introduce a results-based approach into development cooperation if we want to make progress towards achieving our Millennium Development Goals .
<2en> The main objective of creating jobs addresses the central problem of the economic development of South Africa .
<2en> For years , there have been calls for a concept for establishing small and medium-sized enterprises in the country .
<2en> The EU , which is South Africa 's most important trading partner , can provide valuable assistance in the process of economic and social transformation .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Joly on the revision of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa , which has been in force since 2004 .
<2en> In fact , the aim of said revision is to work out new possibilities for liberalising trade in specific sectors and , at the same time , adapting the agreement to the changed international context .
<2en> In my opinion , it is essential to stress that this revision lays the foundations for improving and deepening dialogue between the European Union and South Africa on important issues such as migration , exploitation of energy sources and security .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> In the EU , the service sector is responsible for around 70 % of GDP .
<2en> In some countries , such as Austria , where I come from , this sector is an engine of economic growth .
<2en> The aim of the directive is to remove unreasonable obstacles to the provision of cross-border services .
<2en> Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are frequently confronted with bureaucratic barriers and discrimination which prevent them from benefiting fully from the common internal market .
<2en> The directive takes into consideration the specific social circumstances of the individual Member States .
<2en> Strengthening the control options in the destination country represents an important step forward .
<2en> However , we need to put in place quickly a mechanism for imposing effective sanctions on foreign service providers which break the law .
<2en> I have voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt 's report , because I hope that the implementation of the Services Directive will provide a new stimulus for the labour market .
<sp>
<2en> I approve this report , as I believe it to be a satisfactory and balanced compromise that succeeds in guaranteeing the rights of passengers without simultaneously imposing a heavy burden on carriers , many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> It is therefore a success for Parliament , which managed to change the scope from 500 km , supported by the Council , to 250 km , as well as with regard to the rights of passengers , affecting people with reduced mobility in particular .
<2en> The following should also be highlighted : a guarantee of accommodation in the event of cancellation , a right to immediate assistance in the event of an accident , a right to compensation in the event of cancellation , and the electronic provision of up-to-date information to passengers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that :
<en> 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers ;
<en> 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit , having no room for increased ticket prices , will be cut entirely and there will be no service .
<en> The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK .
<en> We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws , transport and environment laws being no exception .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution , in which the European Parliament expresses its position on protecting the rights of passengers .
<2en> The regulation shall apply to regular services , within and between EU Member States , where the scheduled distance is no greater than 250 km .
<2en> We are talking about the rights of bus passengers when a bus or coach service is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes .
<2en> Then passengers should immediately be offered a choice between continuing their journey or re-routing to their final destination at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price .
<2en> If the carrier fails to offer this choice , passengers shall have the right to compensation in addition to the reimbursement of the ticket price .
<2en> In the event of cancellation or delay , it is also important for passengers to be provided with all necessary information .
<2en> Furthermore , assistance must also be offered where a journey of more than three hours is cancelled or delayed in departure for more than 90 minutes .
<2en> In such instances , meals or refreshments must be offered , as well as hotel accommodation for a maximum of two nights .
<2en> However , the obligation to provide accommodation does not apply if the cancellation or delay is caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters .
<2en> Bearing in mind the difficulties experienced by passengers this winter , when they were unable to reach their destination due to weather conditions and even had to spend several nights in stations , their right to accommodation should be ensured .
<sp>
<2en> In the European Union , more than 70 million Europeans travel by bus and coach every year .
<2en> The firm stance adopted by the European Parliament on the rights of persons travelling by bus or coach means that , from now on , transport operators will provide information , assistance and compensation across the whole EU to comply with passengers ' rights .
<2en> Regardless of the means of transport they use , Europeans now enjoy EU-level protection .
<2en> I support this report which regulates the overbooking of buses and coaches or departures delayed by more than two hours for journeys longer than 250 kilometres , as well as the cancellation of journeys .
<2en> Furthermore , I believe that the policy of non-discrimination against persons with reduced mobility is reflected in a set of basic rights concerning the provision of assistance at bus stations , including free transport for particular items of equipment such as wheelchairs .
<2en> I voted for this report , which supports the rights of persons with disabilities and reduced mobility , such as non-discriminatory access to transport and the right to compensation for the loss of or damage to wheelchairs or other mobility equipment .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I abstained on this report .
<en> While , on the one hand , I have the highest admiration for the work done by Mr Brok , on the other , I have serious doubts about using parliamentary immunity to prevent due legal process on a tax avoidance case .
<sp>
<2en> Paying tax is a duty that no citizen should be able to shirk .
<2en> This has been pointed out to Mr Brok .
<2en> The purpose of immunity is not to offer protection from criminal offences but to protect freedom of expression .
<2en> I am therefore pleased that he has rectified his mistake .
<2en> The report is nonetheless unpleasant on more than one account .
<2en> Mr Speroni , EUR 5 000 is not a negligible amount , and no one forced Mr Brok into this situation .
<2en> Therefore , the accusations of persecution for ' the accidental omission of a minor sum ' are , to my mind , completely uncalled-for .
<2en> I shall vote against .
<sp>
<2en> Defending the independence of the mandate of Members of this House is the responsibility of Parliament , and that independence cannot be jeopardised .
<2en> With respect to the allegations , the Member is the target of fumus persecutionis , in other words , the proceedings were brought with the sole aim of damaging the reputation of the Member concerned .
<2en> I am therefore not in favour of waiving his immunity .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Despite the fact that , personally , I dislike Elmar Brok because of his inappropriate behaviour and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric , I think that there should be compelling reasons for the waiver of the immunity .
<en> It is well known that the request for waiver was set out in a letter from the Public Prosecutor of Bielefeld in which he claimed that Mr Brok failed to include in his income tax declaration for 2005 a fee of EUR 5 000 for a speech he had given in Munich on 28 October 2005 at the ' Europa Forum ' held by the HypoVereinsbank Group , for which tax was due on an amount of EUR 2 900 .
<en> It is also known that Mr Brok did not pay this money and was caught for that mistake .
<en> Nowadays , immunity is used as a kind of ' cudgel ' for settling one 's account or as ' loose change ' for manipulation of Members of Parliament .
<sp>
<2en> The German Public Prosecutor has requested the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of a Member , Mr Brok .
<2en> These proceedings relate to a failure to disclose on his income tax return fees relating to a talk given in Munich , for receipt of which he owed EUR 2 900 in tax , but which has now been paid .
<2en> However , it refers to the legal opinion that the proceedings in question would not have been handled in the same way if he had been a normal citizen and that there are strong indications of political persecution .
<2en> Under these specific circumstances , and as this is fumus persecutionis , I voted in favour of not waiving Mr Brok 's parliamentary immunity .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I cannot support the Podimata report , because it is Member States that are responsible for tax policy .
<2en> The report does not do justice to that situation .
<2en> What it aims to do is to prescribe a number of taxes at EU level , including a tax on financial transactions and an energy tax .
<2en> If a tax on the financial sector is necessary , the revenues it generates should go to Member States ' treasuries .
<2en> After all , they are the ones who have had to bail out the banks .
<2en> Member States would do well to use these revenues to reduce the public debt , which has increased during the crisis .
<2en> However , the report assumes without question that such revenues could benefit global and EU policy objectives .
<2en> That would then include climate change and development cooperation .
<2en> Furthermore , the report includes an argument for a solidarity levy on air tickets , so that we can combat public health problems and reduce charges in the transport sector .
<2en> I accept that we could pursue these useful policy objectives and that it would be advisable to consider allocating more resources for that purpose .
<2en> However , as this would affect our tax measures , it is Member States who should be taking such initiatives , not Europe dictating them top-down .
<2en> I fear that such an approach may be standing in the way of fruitful cooperation with the Council .
<sp>
<2en> More than three years after the crisis , elements for regulating the financial markets are rather thin on the ground .
<2en> In this respect , a new tax would allow for new sources of finance to be released and for the most questionable financial practices to be regulated .
<2en> Let us be clear : it is , at present , impossible to say that what happened three years ago will not happen again in the future .
<2en> It is enough to drive one to despair .
<2en> The challenge is therefore to know whether Europe has the critical mass to take specific action .
<2en> I believe that it does and that the sooner it takes action on this matter , the better !
<sp>
<2en> The adoption of this report in plenary indicates a path which the European Union seems to want to go down .
<2en> Although the idea of introducing a tax on financial transactions seems to support the general public , even if the G20 leaders failed to agree on setting such a contribution at global level , I feel obliged to mention that this could have an adverse impact in the medium and long term .
<2en> The impact of such a tax , imposed only on capital established in the EU , will certainly be to make this capital migrate to developed or emerging countries outside the EU .
<2en> The other scenario , at least in an initial phase , will be that this tax will be passed on in the form of costs to the credit consumer or other financial services .
<2en> Whatever the situation , the perverse effect of this is that the EU will move even closer to the dangerous situation where it will lose its competitiveness against other states such as the US , Japan or the BRIC countries .
<2en> This will slow down economic growth and create problems , including for the real economy , which is dependent on the cheapest possible sources of financing .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report because I agree with the need for the European Union to seek new innovative financing instruments .
<2en> Such instruments would , in fact , allow the EU to address the current challenges , because they would play both a regulatory role and a role for the production of revenue .
<2en> It has often been pointed out in this House that the economic crisis has highlighted the lack of regulation and supervision of the global financial system .
<2en> We also know that the taxpayers are currently the first to bear the cost of the crisis , not only through direct taxation , but also in terms of rising unemployment , dwindling incomes , reduced access to social services and increasing inequalities .
<2en> New instruments are needed if we are to come up with holistic and integrated responses to the crisis .
<2en> I agree , therefore , to the introduction of the long-discussed Eurobonds , which can lead to joint management of debt by aggregating part of the sovereign debt .
<2en> The rapporteur also proposes other funding instruments designed to curb speculation : for example , coherent and effective taxation of the energy sector and the drawing up of proposals for a tax on development that will lead to increased resources for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals .
<sp>
<2en> We are constantly confronted in the EU with the consequences of the financial crisis , which , in 2009 , overflowed into a budgetary crisis , a significant aspect of which was the excessive issuing of government bonds .
<2en> In contrast to the approved report , however , I do not see market pressures in this , but rather the irresponsible budgetary policy of many national governments that are unwilling to reform their pension , health and employment systems .
<2en> In my opinion , putting the blame on market failure is misguided and shows a lack of courage to face up to the necessary reforms .
<2en> We have now approved rules on more stringent financial regulation and financial market supervision , and we should go further and take measures to kick-start European economies , for example , in the form of funding for common infrastructure projects and tax incentives for firms to invest in science and research .
<2en> I would like to warn against the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and various forms of bank taxes , because it would tie up the financial market and distort competition .
<2en> Eurobonds are not the solution , as they only transfer fiscal irresponsibility to the European level , to places further away from public control , where attempts at excessive spending would have even more serious repercussions than at the national level .
<2en> I am also not in favour of a Europe-wide carbon tax , as this would impose a disproportionate burden on the energy sector in particular , and ultimately reduce the energy security of the EU .

<en> Mr President , Members of the House need no telling how useful to us the publication Recent and Forthcoming Work in Committee is .
<en> It gives us a way to plan forward .
<en> A week ago I was asked by a colleague who works as an advisor to the Scottish Parliament if there was anyway I could help her with the problem of foreseeing business coming forward in the European Parliament in order that committees of that other parliament should be aware of our work and able to plan in relation to it .
<en> I said that there was a marvellous publication and I would get it for her .
<en> My staff asked for it in Parliament this week and I asked the Parliament office in Edinburgh if they could provide it .
<en> I was informed that this is a rare work of which Members of Parliament get one copy each and which may not be copied for anyone else , and no further copies can be obtained .
<en> In these days of transparency in the conduct of our business , it seems to me that is a provision which ought to be re-examined .
<en> This very useful publication should be made widely available .
<en> A second point : Yesterday , we approved minutes which drew attention to Mrs Doyle 's statement of Thursday , 7 February , that in respect of the Watson report the PPE-ED Group by mistake failed to vote in favour of the habeas corpus amendment .
<en> Had they not made that mistake because of a late change in numbering , that amendment would have been carried in Parliament .
<en> This is a momentous fact which I hope will be drawn to the attention of Commissioner Vitorino , the President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi as chair of the relevant committee of this House .
<sp>
<en> We have taken note of your second point , Mr MacCormick .
<en> With regard to the first point , I believe that the President of Parliament intends to give one of the Vice-Presidents responsibility for supervising relations with the citizens and for transparency and communication between Parliament and the citizens .
<en> It has not yet been decided which Vice-President but I think he or she may be the person you should contact regarding the matter you have raised .

<2en> Europe is currently finding that it has become less competitive in global markets .
<2en> As such , Europe needs to find ways of strengthening its industrial base to face up to new challenges .
<2en> This report , ' An integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era ' , aims to table proposals to relaunch European industry .
<2en> An integrated and sustainable industrial policy must be based on scientific research , on innovation , on increased resource efficiency , on a commodities strategy , on reinforcing small and medium-sized enterprises , and on developing regional networks .
<2en> In particular , it is essential for energy efficiency and the introduction of information and communication technologies to constitute the basis of the industrial revolution , so as to increase competitiveness , economic growth and employment .
<2en> I particularly welcome the emphasis given to traditional European industry , which is essential to our economy .
<2en> Measures such as the introduction of new technologies and increased efforts in scientific research and innovation in sectors such as the manufacturing industry are of crucial importance .
<2en> This is the only way that we will be able to return European industry to a leading position in the world .

<2en> Industrial policy is essential for the European Union , and this report is an opportunity for the European Commission : the initial communication was disappointing .
<2en> Parliament 's work provides the Commission with concrete proposals that it must take up .
<2en> This report should be linked to our proposals , which the European Parliament as a whole adopted this week , including , in particular , the principle of a ' tax on financial transactions ' at European level and of issuing EU bonds ( Eurobonds ) .
<2en> Our policies must show that social innovation and technological innovation are compatible .
<sp>
<2en> In the vote on the Lange report , I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording , which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds .
<2en> However , taking it as a whole , I am voting for the report , as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves .
<2en> Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects .
<2en> This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts , as would be the case with Eurobonds .
<sp>
<2en> Clearly , Europe must develop a long-term European industrial strategy .
<2en> We cannot be the only economic area in the world to unilaterally apply free trade principles while having no idea of what our main competitors are doing .
<2en> The European Commission has to realise that , with the crisis , the rules put in place are no longer suitable for today 's economy , and that it is time to seriously strengthen the European Union 's anti-dumping arsenal and the application of the general principle of reciprocity in trade .
<2en> The European Union needs a European strategy that serves as a vehicle for major industrial projects such as Galileo and ITER .
<2en> It must also support its production sectors and its SME base .
<2en> It must promote and increase its research and development investments so as to try to maintain its lead in the area of high technology .
<2en> Similarly , it must step up the fight against counterfeiting , and put forward an offensive European patent policy .
<sp>
<2en> This text does not stand out for its quality , since it is the result of a very broad compromise between the MEPs .
<2en> It contains both elements that are very positive in the eyes of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and certain ideas that we have sought in vain to denounce .
<2en> However , the main thing is that it enables MEPs to express a rather progressive opinion on the EU 2020 strategy 's flagship programme dedicated to industry .
<2en> Hence , the text calls for transport systems to be made more sustainable through the use of more efficient technologies , interoperability and innovative mobility solutions .
<2en> It points out the need to place energy and resource savings at the heart of European industrial policy .
<2en> In this respect , it recalls the huge job potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield .
<2en> The adoption of measures that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors .
<2en> MEPs also sought to encourage all the efforts made to redress skills shortages in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry .

<2en> Mr President , Mrs Ojuland is right when she says she has the impression we are always talking about the same thing and never seeing the expected results .
<2en> However , unfortunately , she is mistaken in saying we are unanimous on this .
<2en> I would like to ask all of us here to speak with one voice , and to speak as strongly as Mr Protasiewicz , who has sent a clear signal to all those fighting for liberty and democracy in Belarus that we are with them , and who has given a clear warning to the regime in Belarus that what they are doing is unacceptable .
<2en> Well , alongside that voice , which ought to be supported by everyone , there are also other opinions being expressed , and unfortunately by one of the authors of the resolution , that incidents of torture occur in Belarus just as they do in some European countries and in some of the European Union 's Member States .
<2en> This is unacceptable .
<2en> Mrs Ojuland is right that we are being listened to , and that it is not only we who are listening to each other , but that there is also someone else who is listening to us .
<2en> If there are going to be such divergent opinions , then in my opinion , we are going to continue to be ineffective .
<2en> Thank you very much .

<en> ( FI ) Mr President , Europe 's last dictator , Lukashenko , has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 16 years .
<en> The country 's media and judiciary are under his sovereign control , and he also has no hesitation in using them to crush the political opposition , as we saw in the recent fraudulent Presidential elections in December .
<en> At that time , special troops and the police , of course , violently broke up demonstrations and arrested hundreds of people , including nearly all opposition presidential candidates .
<en> The EU 's demands to release political prisoners and end the violence against citizens have been totally ignored by the Lukashenko administration .
<en> It is now imperative that the EU introduces more robust economic sanctions , since Lukashenko has simply exploited the Eastern Partnership programme and all the benefits of neighbourhood policy .
<en> We cannot accept such brutal violations of human rights anywhere in the world , but least of all in the backwoods of Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , we do not actually have to go beyond Europe 's borders to find countries that violate fundamental rights .
<en> In Belarus , you can be indicted and go to prison merely for taking part in a protest , standing in elections , or stating your opinion .
<en> Political awareness on the part of the people and civil activism are not a burden for society : they should be something that enriches it .
<en> It is difficult , however , to believe that democracy could be strengthened in Belarus merely through EU coercion .
<en> There is also a need for dialogue at grassroots level and participation in civil society .
<en> The EU should support democratic development in Belarus and continue to organise cultural and educational projects with it .
<en> The European External Action Service should actively monitor developments in Belarus and support the Belarusians so that European values might also be internalised there .

<en> ( RO ) Mr President , two days ago , on 8 March , International Women 's Day , Natalia Radina was unable to enjoy this celebration because she was under house arrest .
<en> On the same day , Ales Mikhalevich celebrated his 53rd birthday in prison .
<en> The simple reason for this is that he is a free man , a man who dared to enter the presidential contest and , in a dictatorship like Belarus , the penalty for making such gestures of freedom is to have one 's movements restricted and get sent to prison .
<en> I would like to highlight two points in our resolution which I regard as extremely important .
<en> I feel that we need to support the extension of the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union by producing a list which includes the prosecutors , judges and members of the secret police involved in the recent human rights violations in Belarus .
<en> Secondly , I also believe that we must do everything we can to support civil society in this country , which can give us some hope .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin my speech with an appeal to the Belarusian authorities to stop the censorship against the democratic forces and independent press .
<en> I also propose reopening the OSCE Office in Belarus .
<en> Human rights were dealt a heavy blow at the time of the presidential elections in December 2010 .
<en> The demonstrations organised by the opposition against election fraud were mercilessly crushed by the security forces .
<en> Those arrested include one of the presidential candidates , Ales Mikhalevich .
<en> He publicised the torture he was subjected to in prison , a fact , however , which has been denied by the authorities .
<en> Journalists close to the opposition were also targeted at the same time .
<en> In spite of the ban on making statements , they confirmed Mikhalevich 's assertions in the hope of attracting the EU 's attention to the critical situation in Belarus .
<en> The circumstances under which the arrests were made are vague , but the treatment they state they were subjected to amounts to serious human rights violations .

<sp>
<en> Mr President , I will reflect on some of these issues from the perspective of the Chair of the Internal Market Committee , because I think that very fundamental economic and internal market issues are at stake here , as well as the really important issues about the protection of our citizens ' rights that we have talked about today .
<en> I have been writing a report for my committee on this issue .
<en> I want to thank Ms Reding for the Green Paper on which that was based , because I think that one of the core , ambitious issues that she raised in there is at the core of what we have been discussing tonight .
<en> She was saying that if , as a European citizen , my data was held on a server or database in a country outside Europe 's jurisdiction , I should have the same rights over that data as I would have if the server was within the European Union .
<en> That is a really ambitious programme .
<en> I hope we can achieve that .
<en> It will need a lot of negotiation .
<en> I would just say to my colleagues , particularly Ms in ' t Veld , that if we are going to offer that , then other countries will demand reciprocal rights as well .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , I share the legitimate concerns of this House when it comes to the protection of the private data of European citizens .
<en> Because I share this concern , I have presented an initial analysis on how the reform of the 1995 directive could look , in order to answer the questions which have been raised today and which do not have a legal answer under European legislation as it stands .
<en> There is good news regarding relations with our American counterparts .
<en> On 16 March , the White House took a decisive step in announcing that it intends to work with Congress to produce a privacy bill of rights .
<en> That is a huge change in the United States , and it could also help us in our efforts to conclude a general EU-US agreement on data privacy concerning police and judicial cooperation .
<en> I hope that we will be able to start the negotiations in this direction soon .
<en> I am counting on Parliament to help with this endeavour and with the reform of the 1995 directive .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your understanding , that is , for not disputing that we cannot intervene from here in an ongoing criminal procedure , and that in all cases the law in force at the time of an offence must be applied .
<en> I would like to inform you that nothing demonstrates the commitment of the Hungarian Presidency to data protection better than the fact that , at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in February , we adopted Council conclusions on the subject of data protection , comprising about fifty items .
<en> In this we also addressed two very important questions to the Commission that are relevant to the present debate .
<en> We called attention to the importance of informing citizens , as well as to the importance of Internet-related data protection , and I am certain , as the Commissioner has also mentioned , by the way , that the Commission will take these into account when drafting its proposal .
<en> The Council also fully agrees that it is important to modernise legislation and adapt it to technical developments .
<en> We are looking forward to receiving the proposal for a new data protection directive from the Commission .
<en> We promised it for June , when the Hungarian Presidency will not have much time left , but we will do everything in our power , and I am sure that the Polish Presidency will approach the issue of data protection with similar commitment .
<en> We believe , Mr President , and with this I conclude my speech , that we do not have to choose between freedom and security , namely data security , but that these can also be ensured simultaneously , and our goal is to create such a data protection legislation for the EU .
<sp>

<2en> Even though the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency ( ENISA ) expires on 13 March 2012 , the European Union must still take measures in this area .
<2en> It was therefore necessary to adopt an extension of the Agency 's mandate , which would guarantee coherence and continuity on the issue of network and information security .
<2en> This explains why I voted in favour of this text .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report extending the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency ( ENISA ) until the adoption of a new regulation on this agency 's revised provisions and principles at work .
<en> ENISA was established in 2004 for an initial period of five years , with the main goal of ensuring a high and effective level of network and information security within the Union , thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market .
<en> Recent cyber attacks in the Member States are making us rethink and reformulate the Agency 's mandate to attain a more flexible response capability and to bolster the Agency 's operational efficiency .
<en> Giving all EU citizens the opportunity to use digital technology , and ensuring confidence in the Internet and its security , is one of the key objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe .
<en> Once ENISA has been modernised , the latest information will be gathered from European countries , there will be encouragement to share best practices and the European Union and the Member States will be better prepared to prevent , detect and respond more effectively to network and information security problems .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( BG ) I supported Giles Chichester 's report on establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency as regards its duration because I think that information and communications technology ( ICT ) has become the backbone of the European economy and society as a whole .
<en> ICT is vulnerable to threats which come from outside national borders and change as the technologies and market evolve .
<en> Since ICT is global , interconnected and dependent on another infrastructure , its security and resilience cannot be guaranteed based on purely national and uncoordinated approaches .
<en> At the same time , the challenges associated with network and information systems are rapidly evolving .
<en> Network and information systems must have effective protection against any kind of intrusion and outages , including attacks carried out by people .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report since I agree with the need to extend the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency .
<2en> This body , established by the European Union in 2004 for a five-year term , now needs a further extension in order to make it relevant to present-day needs and security risks .
<2en> Indeed , the increasingly heavy use of computer communication facilitates the work of many , but is often also a danger , especially for children .
<2en> Precise rules are needed to protect users .
<2en> However , changes to the regulation require more time , and this is why it is necessary to extend the mandate of the Agency .
<sp>
<2en> I decided to vote for this report as I feel it is necessary to extend the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency until 2013 .
<2en> This agency was set up for a period of five years in March 2004 , which was then extended until March 2012 .
<2en> The main objective was to guarantee effective security for the EU 's IT networks .
<2en> Since we are living in a world which has become increasingly dependent on the Internet , we must increase our awareness of the problem of Internet security as cybercrime is not merely virtual , but has a real impact on our lives .
<2en> This issue also features on NATO 's agenda , resulting in an EU-US working group being set up to tackle IT crime and security , which marks a very important step in protecting the IT infrastructure .
<2en> I truly believe that we still need the European Network and Information Security Agency .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , your words are in line with what we wanted to hear .
<en> I would not , however , like to ideologise this debate which is sometimes ideologised in a bipartisan manner .
<en> I believe that it is a very serious matter to speak of a humanitarian emergency .
<en> The question I ask myself , and that I also address to my fellow MEPs , is as follows : ' Can we speak of humanitarian emergency and stop at that point , or should we ask two types of questions , one about the emergency and thus about the immediate issues , and another about strategy ? '
<en> The problem of Africa and the Middle East is a problem that must , by definition , lie outside Europe , and the question that arises is whether there can be development without democracy .
<en> Let us remember that the revolt in these countries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean has not been about ideology but about bread , a revolt for democracy in order to survive .
<en> We are bound to ask ourselves certain questions about this .
<en> It is all very well , Commissioner , to address the problem of Directive 2001 / 55 / EC and everything that Frontex is doing , but Europe must ask itself what it wants to do about the Mediterranean and the whole of Africa .
<en> Many of my fellow Members have spoken of Libya and other countries .
<en> This makes me think of Darfur , of certain situations where genocide goes on every day in Africa .
<en> The only discordant note I would add is this : it is not true that Europe is responsible for looting .
<en> Of course , some European countries are partly responsible , but in Africa , a number of capitalist systems interact that are not based on the social economy of labour , like our own , but are based on the state economy , state capitalism .
<en> The leading example is China , which buys sovereign debts and exploits entire populations .
<en> We cannot go and oust presidents who are driven by crime .
<en> Even the UN cannot do this .
<en> I think that we should leave aside the ideological issues and think about the immediate problem , and that means welcoming these people , all of them together .
<en> Tomorrow , though , we cannot avoid discussing Europe 's strategy towards the whole of Africa .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , we have come to the end of the speeches , so I am going to focus on two points in the form of questions .
<en> Firstly , the humanitarian chaos in the Mediterranean is the inevitable consequence of the shortcomings , indeed of the lack of a common migration policy , within the European Union .
<en> To seek merely to prevent migration flows bound for Europe is unrealistic , and it means that , today , third countries and Member States in southern Europe are alone having to suffer the consequences .
<en> The Italian response - collective expulsions - is not acceptable , and neither is the French position of closing the borders ; it resolves nothing and simply overlooks the real issues at stake .
<en> My first question is this : can we expect a shake-up and the development of a balanced European migration policy ?
<en> My second question concerns European solidarity also ; I do not see it as a slogan but as something that has become an urgent and absolute necessity .
<en> I , too , urge the Council to respond urgently and activate the solidarity mechanism provided for by the directive on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx , but I also urge the Member States to respond to the UNHCR 's appeal for the urgent resettlement mechanism to be applied .
<en> Therefore , my second question is : can we expect concrete action at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 11 and 12 April ?
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Madam President , I believe that today 's debate on the Provera report is welcome in view of recent events in the Mediterranean region and North Africa .
<en> I wish to begin by emphasising the need for an EU-level approach to managing the migration flows triggered by the wave of revolution in the Arab world , in the spirit of solidarity required by Article 80 of the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> On the other hand , I wish to congratulate Mr Provera for his report which underlines the need to take into account consistently the deep-rooted causes of the instability which is the source of the migration flows .
<en> Plenty of events are going on at the moment , reminding us of the urgent need for action .
<en> In the wake of the post-election conflict in Côte d 'Ivoire , for example , hundreds of thousands of Ivorians sought refuge in neighbouring countries , including 94 000 of them in Liberia alone , a country itself threatened by instability .
<en> In order to escape this spiral of instability and migration , I think that we need to emphasise , above all , the preventive aspect .
<en> By this I am primarily thinking of preventing conflicts .
<en> We must also consider promoting democracy and human rights , as well as , of course , improving the economic situation in the long term .
<en> Then again , in my view , we need to make better use of the instruments we have available as part of the global approach to migration in order to encourage synergy between migration and development .
<en> The issue of migration must automatically feature in the dialogue with Europe 's partners .
<en> Efforts must also be stepped up in supporting development projects in the countries of origin and transit , which improve living conditions and these countries ' ability to manage migration flows .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , everything is uncertain as regards the situation in North Africa .
<en> We do not know the immediate outcome of the civil war in Libya , we do not know whether the new political order in the Maghreb countries and Egypt will be conducive to democracy , or whether even worse conditions will arise with regard to democracy and relations with Europe .
<en> As for the arrival of an unstoppable stream of fugitives from the shores of Africa onto European shores and those of Lampedusa in particular , it is difficult , even in this case , to distinguish those who are fleeing from violence and fear of death , those who have , for example , escaped from prison , and those who are looking for a future that holds better things than the hunger in their country .
<en> We can nevertheless be sure of certain things .
<en> Firstly , human dignity must be respected in all human beings .
<en> Secondly , the European approach is to offer hospitality to all refugees .
<en> Thirdly , the borders of the individual states which form part of the European Union are the borders of Europe .
<en> Fourthly , there is a duty of solidarity among all European countries that are part of the Union : this was confirmed , strengthened and made legally binding by the Treaty of Lisbon , which also governs migration policy and the management of migratory flows in an area of freedom , security and justice .
<en> Fifthly , the instruments for coping with emergencies such as the current one are already in place , in the form of Directive 2001 / 55 / EC , Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office ( EASO ) .
<en> The current situation is one of those situations that reveals whether Europe actually is or is not a reality .
<en> Commissioner , I greatly enjoyed your speech , but I think we should move from words to deeds .
<en> I am well aware of this and I know you will act .
<en> We hope that your proposal will be followed up .
<en> The important thing is that words are not enough : we need deeds to make Europe a reality .
<en> This is an opportunity to build Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , we are at a turning point .
<en> I say this , because we need to consider how we intend to move forward , beyond the crisis facing us at the moment .
<en> We managed , in previous years , to limit migration flows from North Africa to southern Europe , to Italy , Spain , Portugal , Malta and Greece , through bilateral agreements between these countries and the corresponding countries in North Africa , and we really did achieve significant results .
<en> That is why there is now more pressure on Greece via Turkey , because Europe and Greece have been unable to apply similar agreements with Turkey , despite the fact that such bilateral agreements exist .
<en> My question therefore is this : now that all this disruption has broken out , what is to become of these agreements , Commissioner ?
<en> Could we - and should we - link these prior agreements or other future agreements to the financing we provide ?
<en> The package of measures you announced is very good and we must help these countries .
<en> It is our duty to help all our fellow men ; however , this must be linked with an obligation on the part of these countries to take back everyone who has arrived in Lampedusa and everyone who arrives in the immediate or more distant future in other European countries , because the greater the pressure , the more people will arrive in other countries .
<en> While we are on the subject and as Directive 2001 / 55 / EC has been raised , perhaps we should review what we were saying a year ago ; several Members have referred to the famous reallocation that we have awaited so anxiously .
<en> We are still waiting to apply repatriation and resettlement ; please tell us what else we should do .
<en> Perhaps , however , we should start straight away with the internal resettlement of refugees , so as to relieve the pressure on the countries which face a real problem ?
<en> Finally , because my time has run out , we must limit fragmentary approaches by the Member States .
<en> Some countries , such as Germany and France , are selectively suspending returns under Dublin II to Greece .
<en> We may face the same problem with Italy in the immediate or more distant future .
<en> The Greek Government has come along and announced another fragmentary approach : a fence in Evros , but we have no overall solution to the problem .
<en> This is such a vital issue that we need real solidarity and an overall strategy , Commissioner .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The fisheries sector in the region of the Comoros is very specific .
<2en> The catches made by local fishermen hardly ever suffice to meet the needs of the local community .
<2en> This is caused by poorly developed and , frankly , non-existent port and fishing fleet infrastructure .
<2en> The people who live on the islands in this part of the Indian Ocean are very poor , face the problem of unemployment and , as the rapporteur himself writes , are , in practice , dependent on financial help from abroad .
<2en> The partnership agreement , which allows vessels from the EU to fish in Comorian territory in exchange for financial support , will undoubtedly contribute to a strengthening of the region 's economy .
<2en> We should , however , monitor the way in which these funds are spent , and whether they do , in fact , contribute to an improvement in the situation in the sector .
<sp>
<2en> The aim of the new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the partnership agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Union of the Comoros is to strengthen the partnership and cooperation in the fisheries sector using all the available financial instruments .
<2en> The protocol will create a framework which is conducive to the growth of investment in this sector and which will help to increase the value of the products of small-scale fisheries .
<2en> I welcome the proposal to establish this new protocol .
<sp>
<2en> The Council 's draft recommendation regarding the establishment of a protocol which stipulates fishing quotas and financial contribution as set out by the partnership with the fisheries sector of the Union of the Comoros is intended to outline the role that the European Parliament should play in the procedure of reviewing this agreement .
<2en> Europe has always pursued partnership agreements in the fisheries sector and the partnership with the Union of the Comoros has been in force since 1988 .
<2en> The objective of this new protocol is to set out the fishing quotas to be offered to fishing vessels of the Union of the Comoros , providing a sustainable and responsible use of fishery resources , increasing investment in small-scale fisheries and enhancing their activity .
<2en> The draft Council decision on the project ensures that both partners , Europe and the Union of the Comoros , will benefit from the renewal of the agreement but , since , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , Parliament has gained a specific role in the implementation of the agreements , it seems inevitable that , at each step until the final approval of the agreement , we must identify the measures that will involve Parliament .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report .
<en> The conclusion of bilateral fisheries agreements between the European Community and non-member countries , termed ' Fisheries Partnership Agreements ' ( FPA ) since 2004 , has been standard practice under the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) and is central to the policy 's external dimension .
<en> Under the agreements with African and Pacific countries , the EU 's financial contribution is , to a large extent , expressly intended to support national fisheries policies based on the principle of sustainability and sound management of fishery resources .
<en> The partnership agreements therefore amount to a commitment to promoting responsible and sustainable fishing wherever EU vessels might be operating , based on a thorough assessment of the resources available , making sure that the fishing opportunities to be used have been vouched for by credible scientific opinions and ruling out any risk of depleting local stocks .
<sp>
<2en> This new agreement replaces the one previously in force , which expired on 31 December 2010 .
<2en> This kind of agreement makes it possible for EU fishing vessels to access the fishing zones of the Comoros islands in exchange for a financial contribution .
<2en> The great advantage of this kind of protocol is that the European Union can help with these countries ' development .
<2en> In this case , it will give more help to the fisheries sector , since this sector will absorb about 50 % of the funds contributed .
<2en> We should bear in mind that about 30 000 people in the Comoros depend directly on the fisheries sector , hence the importance of this support .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The existence of adequate regulation in terms of technical measures is an instrument necessary for the sustainable use and proper conservation of fisheries resources .
<2en> This regulation on transitional technical measures resulted from the lack of agreement in 2008 on the draft regulation aimed at simplifying and clarifying Community rules on the conservation of fisheries resources .
<2en> It was intended to apply for the period from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011 .
<2en> It is now proposed that it be extended for an additional period of 18 months , or until 1 January 2013 , with the aim of establishing a new set of technical measures in the context of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy , pending a Commission proposal during 2011 .
<2en> We believe that this extension should not be made without correcting the shortcomings and problems raised by the current legislation .
<2en> Unfortunately , the rapporteur and the majority in Parliament , following the Commission 's position , have prevented that .
<2en> This is a case of discrimination without any scientific justification against a section of the small-scale Portuguese fishing fleet , aimed at fishing for sole and hake using trammel nets , which is prohibited under the current rules .
<2en> This will have negative economic and social consequences which could and should be avoided .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - ' No more discards ! ' cries the Commission .
<en> ' Listen to the industry ' is its pretended watchword .
<en> Then it seeks to reimpose fundamentally flawed regulations for a further 18 months .
<en> No less than 42 % of West of Scotland haddock catches are dumped back into the sea because of these rules .
<en> Today 's vote means that this obscenity will continue for another 18 months .
<en> London Labour backed the Commission : yet another shameful betrayal of our coastal communities !
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because , in 2008 , in the absence of agreement on a draft regulation to simplify and clarify the Community rules on the conservation of fisheries resources , a regulation was adopted establishing a package of transitional technical measures intended originally to apply from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011 .
<2en> The purpose of the present proposal is to extend these transitional arrangements for a further 18 months , i.e. until 1 January 2013 , so that a new package of technical measures can be drawn up - which will be the subject of a proposal submitted by the Commission in 2011 - as part of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy .
<2en> The Commission must take advantage of this extension of the current regulation 's validity to carry out an evaluation - with stakeholder involvement - of the impact of the current measures on the vessels applying them and on the ecosystems concerned .
<2en> It will have to take the results of the evaluation into account in drawing up a new proposal for a regulation which will apply from 1 January 2013 and which , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , will be adopted under the codecision procedure .
<sp>
<2en> Extending the validity of the regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for a further 18 months opens up the possibility of analysing and evaluating the current impact on the vessels and ecosystems affected by the regulation .
<2en> The proposal is therefore very welcome as it will allow the best possible use to be made of the opportunities for improvement that have been identified .
<2en> The results of the evaluation can then be incorporated by the Commission into the process of drawing up a new proposal for a regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures .

<2en> This is a report on the Draft amending budget that aims to respond to the request for mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund ( EUSF ) to repair the damage caused by disasters that affected five Member States , as well as Croatia , in May and June 2010 .
<2en> These were ' unavoidable , exceptional or unforeseen circumstances ' , as defined in the Financial Regulation , and therefore , in our view , this procedure is both justified and necessary .
<2en> The amount mobilised in support of these countries - EUR 182.4 million - represents only about 3 % of the total damage , which is estimated at about EUR 5 512.7 million .
<2en> The Member States of the EU have been hard hit by a considerable number of disasters in recent years .
<2en> In the first six years of the EUSF , the Commission received 62 requests for financial support from 21 different countries .
<2en> About a third of these qualified as ' major natural disasters ' , as do four of the cases that we are considering here today .
<2en> The EUSF is an important instrument for helping to remedy the almost always considerable and often long-lasting impact of disasters on people , the environment and the economy .
<2en> A commitment to prevention is also important .
<sp>
<2en> I agreed with the report and the rapporteur 's proposal to accept without amendment the Council 's position on Draft amending budget 1 / 2011 , because financial assistance to these countries , i.e. Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Croatia and Romania , has to be delivered and cannot be delayed further .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this Commission proposal for mobilisation of the EUSF which is based on point 26 of the IIA of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management that allows for such mobilisation within an annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion .
<en> The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are detailed in Council Regulation No 2012 / 2002 establishing the EUSF .
<en> It should be recalled that the objective of the Fund is to repair infrastructure and act as a refinancing tool , and not to compensate private damages .
<en> This proposal for mobilisation of the EUSF is the first to be presented by the Commission for the year 2011 .
<sp>
<2en> This Draft amending budget makes sense , considering the purpose of the funds mobilised through the Solidarity Fund to address the effects of the landslides and severe flooding resulting from heavy rainfall in Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania .
<2en> After verifying that the requests meet the eligibility criteria of Regulation ( EC ) No 2012 / 2002 , the Commission proposed the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the sum of EUR 182.4 million in order to deal with the events in those countries .
<2en> However , I would like to highlight the delay in the mobilisation of this type of support .
<2en> The procedure needs to be made less bureaucratic and more streamlined in order to respond to future disaster situations in a timely manner .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Taking into account the fact that Draft amending budget No 1 / 2011 to the general budget 2011 aims at mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 182.4 million in commitment and payment appropriations in order to mitigate the effects of flooding resulting from heavy rainfall in Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania , I voted ' for ' .

<2en> Last October , the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services , Michel Barnier , presented his ' Single Market Act ' , a collection of 50 proposals for boosting growth in the European Union .
<2en> The European Parliament was then invited to give its view on the various parts of this paper .
<2en> Part 3 of the Act calls on the Member States and the institutions to implement the measures necessary to bring the citizens and the Single Market closer together .
<2en> In particular , this rapprochement will be achieved by launching a mutual evaluation system for the 2006 Services Directive and by increasing consultation and dialogue with civil society , both when preparing and implementing texts and in resolving problems .
<2en> I voted for Parliament 's resolution because it welcomes the commitments made by the Commission and highlights the importance of improving the clarity of European texts or of using its power to impose sanctions in order to oblige the Member States to respect their commitments .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report which states that one of the key challenges in relaunching the Single Market is ensuring political leadership , commitment and coordination .
<en> The 50 proposals for relaunching the Single Market encompass numerous portfolios , crucially involving the competences of several commissioners in the Commission , and touch upon the jurisdiction of various committees in the European Parliament .
<en> In the Council , the Single Market Act is furthermore split into different Council configurations whose role and effectiveness vary a great deal .
<en> National institutions also differ a lot in the ways that they are configured and in their organisational cultures .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) Member States must adopt a firm joint stance in order to improve the functioning of the European Single Market and prevent the return of economic protectionism , which would result in fragmentation of the internal market and affect competitiveness .
<en> The aim of the European Single Market Act is to develop administrative cooperation between Member States , also by means of expanding the role of regional authorities with a view to establishing coordination at their level .
<en> Unfortunately , it is relatively difficult to register such programmes at regional level as a result of the economic disparities between EU regions .
<en> In order to revitalise the less developed regions , we need to focus on human capital .
<en> The region 's prosperity is determined firstly by the productivity of its inhabitants and their skills , in addition to the level of capital investment and their innovative capacity .
<en> However , there are major differences even between regions in the same Member State .
<en> I think that adapting the European Single Market to the needs of European citizens is achieved primarily through improving worker mobility .
<en> The free movement of labour can make a significant contribution to narrowing the disparities between regions .
<en> Another key aspect is the provision of ongoing education and training for workers .
<en> Specialist workers and those who have retrained for another career can meet the market 's specific needs much more easily , thanks to their high level of mobility .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The economic and financial crisis has demonstrated the failure of euro-liberalism , the dogmatic framework of the Single Market .
<en> Far from changing course , EU leaders are rushing headlong down the same path and consolidating the mechanisms which inherently underpin unbridled liberalisation .
<en> The ' governance ' proposed on the pretext of improving coordination aims to bypass and punish national parliaments opposed to this dogma being applied .
<en> This report is harmful for the European economy and shows contempt for popular sovereignty .
<en> I shall vote against it .
<sp>
<2en> The Single Market has always been one of the pillars of Europe 's economic development .
<2en> I believe that one of the key challenges in relaunching the Single Market is ensuring political leadership , commitment and coordination .
<2en> These 50 proposals to relaunch the Single Market encompass numerous portfolios , crucially involving the competences of several commissioners in the European Commission and touch upon the jurisdictions of various committees in the European Parliament .
<2en> However , it is important for the Member States to establish their own priorities and develop their own agenda in line with the priorities of the Single Market .

<2en> The Indian economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the world .
<2en> Even now , the majority of Indian foreign investment is situated in the European Union and the Tata Group alone is a leading employer in the industrial sector in Great Britain .
<2en> Taking into account the pace of India 's development , it should be acknowledged that the trade agreement between India and the EU will form one of the most significant and demanding agreements to have been concluded to date .
<2en> The agreement will undoubtedly contribute to an increase in the level of investment and imports and exports for both parties to the agreement .
<2en> It will allow a freer exchange of goods and will contribute to greater prosperity in India as well as in EU countries .
<2en> The agreement will intensify world trade , especially in the field of services .
<2en> In spite of the advantages to be gained from signing the agreement , we should , however , bear in mind issues where both parties to the agreement present opposing views .
<2en> The EU does not accept goods which have been produced to the detriment of the environment , or which have been produced using child labour .
<2en> The agreement which we are striving for should guarantee proper workspaces , diversified , developing economies and multicultural diversity .
<2en> It is crucial to introduce a decision-making system which is effective and improves cooperation , and also to introduce measures to support training for individuals and organisations which will help the regions to develop .
<2en> In order to achieve the aims intended , a transparent and public debate is necessary .
<sp>
<2en> We are entering a crucial stage in the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations .
<2en> This is a difficult exercise in which the Commission will try hard , I hope , to accommodate Europe 's various strategic interests .
<2en> In this respect , I should like to draw attention to the need to make progress in opening up the Indian market to European wine exports .
<2en> Today , the Indian market has closed itself off to our products by imposing exorbitant 150 % tariffs on them .
<2en> We must therefore demand respect for the principle of trade reciprocity .
<2en> It seems absurd , in fact , that our market should be very much open to wine products from emerging countries when we do not have satisfactory access to their market .
<2en> I therefore encourage the Commission to continue the ambitious strategy it was able to carry out when it concluded a free trade agreement with South Korea .
<2en> It is imperative to compensate for the arrival on our market of cheaper wines produced outside the EU with improved access for our products to foreign markets and , in particular , to the Indian market , the growth potential of which is exceptional .

<2en> Mr President , no .
<2en> The Council does not intend to take any action in this regard .
<sp>
<en> Question No 11 by María Izquierdo Rojo ( H-0084 / 02 ) :
<en> Subject : Spanish Presidency and relations with Morocco
<en> What action will the Spanish Presidency take with regard to relations with Morocco ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the Spanish Presidency is delighted with the positive state of relations between the European Union and Morocco and is determined to develop these on several levels : firstly , with the implementation of the Association Agreement that entered into force on 1 March , which sets the stage for close cooperation in a number of areas ; the creation of a free trade area and the establishment of political dialogue , elements which all have a particular importance for the development of global relations with this country .
<2en> Progress has been made in numerous chapters of the Agreement and working groups have been set up in specific sectors .
<2en> The second meeting of the Association Council , taking place today , 13 March 2002 , in Rabat , will provide an excellent opportunity to analyse the work being carried out to implement the Agreement and to lay down the foundations for future work .
<2en> At this meeting , the Presidency will also refer to various issues of a political nature , such as the human rights situation in Morocco and the Western Sahara .
<2en> It will also provide the opportunity to analyse the ways and means of strengthening relations between the European Union and Morocco with a view to preparing for the third meeting of the European Union-Morocco Association Council , which , in principle , will take place under the Danish Presidency during the second half of this year , given that the last meeting took place in October 2001 .
<2en> On the other hand , the objective of the agricultural negotiations the Commission is holding with Morocco , which started in January , is to widely liberalise agricultural trade between the European Union and Morocco .
<2en> In accordance with the Association Agreement , negotiations will resume in parallel with the Association Committee on 14 March and , in principle , will be concluded by the end of 2002 at the latest .
<2en> The Presidency , for its part , will continue to support Morocco 's efforts in regional and subregional cooperation , such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the Agadir Process .
<2en> The latter paves the way for the creation of a free trade area , initially between Morocco , Egypt , Jordan and Tunisia , and , if this proves successful , other countries in the region which have an Association Agreement with the European Union will also have access to this area .
<2en> Finally , the Presidency is pursuing dialogue and cooperation with Morocco on migration policy , including illegal immigration , with the aim , amongst others , of jointly implementing the action plan for Morocco adopted by the Council in October 1999 .
<2en> This plan paves the way for socio-economic development , the integration of Moroccan nationals legally residing in Member States , the management of migratory flows and respect for the right of asylum .
<2en> Several projects are being implemented , having regard , for example , to joint development in the socio-economic area , living and working conditions of Moroccan communities in the European Union , the management of border controls and also support for the fight against illegal immigration .
<2en> A meeting of the working group on social affairs and migration was held yesterday in Rabat , and there will be consultations with regard to negotiations for a readmission agreement between the European Union and Morocco during this current six-month period .
<2en> With regard more specifically to fisheries , the Council recognises the ever-important relationship between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco in this area .
<2en> The Presidency will not spare any effort to ensure that this close relationship is maintained within the framework of a mutually beneficial arrangement between both parties .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , to tell the truth , this answer simply consists of reading out the agenda of meetings , which I think has no real political value and is very misleading , given that the question that was , in fact , asked , was what exactly will be the contribution of the Spanish Presidency to our relations with Morocco .
<2en> Mr President , the President-in-Office had nothing of substance to say .
<2en> This ready-made mould for meetings could be used for our relations with any other country .
<2en> Mr President-in-Office , please do not answer me with an agenda .
<2en> Tell me the precise objectives and priorities of the Spanish Presidency with regard to Morocco .
<2en> Something that we can understand as being an objective or a priority and not simply a agenda of meetings that , I fear , will be no different from the usual blah-blah we always hear .
<sp>
<2en> I am sorry the honourable Member can only remember the dates of the meetings and not their content , so I shall repeat this for her benefit .
<2en> Yesterday , 12 March , today 13 and tomorrow 14 , there are three meetings scheduled by the Presidency that will deal with the three greatest priorities for Morocco with regard to her relations with the European Union .
<2en> Yesterday , the Committee for Migration met to talk about the most pressing issue , the situation of migration from Morocco to the European Union , the situation of Moroccan immigrants in Europe and aid to Morocco for this very serious emigration problem they are suffering .
<2en> Today , the Association Committee is meeting to deal with all the political issues relating to cooperation with Morocco , not only in the economic but also in the political fields , as well as all the projects existing within the association framework and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , which is the fundamental instrument in the relationship between the European Union and Morocco .
<2en> And , tomorrow , the Committee which is looking at all the agricultural exports from Morocco to the European Union will be meeting in Brussels , which is Morocco 's top priority : to be able to export its agricultural produce to the European Union .
<2en> If this seems too little for Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , then , Mr President , then there really is nothing more I can say .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this document .
<en> Presented after the unprecedented floods that devastated last summer a vast portion of Pakistan 's territory , the Commission 's proposal seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences to this country concerning 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan ( mostly textile and clothing ) in the form of exemption from custom duties , with the exception of one product ( ethanol ) for which a tariff-rate quota would apply .
<en> However , although the autonomous trade preferences would be extended to Pakistan for 3 years , a full impact assessment of the proposed measures has not been carried out by the Commission prior to the adoption of the proposal for a regulation .
<en> In addition , it should be noted that the Commission 's proposal does not impose any burden on Pakistan in the field of human and social rights , contrary to what would have happened had GSP + status been granted to this country .
<en> Although it might be argued that , due to the particular set of circumstances that led to the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan , the proposed measures will not create a binding precedent , this explanation is not entirely convincing .
<en> Indeed , it cannot be excluded that the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences for flood-stricken Pakistan may be followed by other similar initiatives in the future .
<en> Furthermore , there is a risk that adopting autonomous trade preferences decoupled from any kind of human rights conditionality would in fact undermine the current system of EU preferences based on the respect of a set of fundamental rights and values .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The European Union is known throughout the world for providing assistance where assistance is needed .
<en> The EU proved this once again by rapidly making aid payments following the dramatic floods and their repercussions in Pakistan in 2010 .
<en> As a next step , the Commission intended giving Pakistan a lift economically and guaranteeing that duties will be suspended on textiles and ethanol .
<en> This approach seems to be highly controversial .
<en> The fact is , however , that this initiative first has to be given the green light at World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) level .
<en> Only then should Parliament become active and make a decision .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I very much regret that , during the vote on autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan , Parliament agreed to reduce the length of the benefits to one year , thus reducing significantly any gain to Pakistan .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour , particularly in consideration of the amendment in which we see that : ' Without prejudice to the conditions set out in paragraph 1 , entitlement to benefit from the preferential arrangements introduced by Article 1 is subject to respect for human rights , including core labour rights , and the fundamental principles of democracy by Pakistan . '
<2en> Respect for human rights must be a necessary precondition for any kind of agreement with third countries .
<sp>
<2en> This report allows us to make the aid we grant an already devastated country dependent on that country 's undertaking to give up all forms of trade protectionism .
<2en> This is an inequitable proposal and I am voting against this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I welcome efforts to promote prosperity beyond the EU 's borders , because I consider our aid important in order for some third countries to be able to tackle their balance of payments crisis and restore the sustainability of foreign debt .
<en> Therefore , and bearing in mind the economic and social problems suffered as a result of the August 2008 armed conflict and the global financial crisis , I agree with the tabled proposal of additional macro-economic financial assistance for Georgia , with a view to supporting its process of economic stabilisation and covering the needs of its balance of payments .
<en> I also believe that this macro-economic assistance will have a positive effect on Georgia 's relations with Member States , in addition to the critical role it will play in the country 's government properly applying reforms .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of this report , because I believe that the mobilisation of the second part of the macro-financial assistance to Georgia is justified and relevant .
<en> Although the Georgian economy is recovering , this additional aid will help Georgia to deal with the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis , and also support the government 's economic reform programme .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Georgia has faced serious problems recently , particularly after the military conflict between the country and Russia due to the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
<en> We are still a long way from being able to consider the option of the country 's accession to the European Union - repeatedly referred to by President Saakashvili - a realistic possibility , given that Georgia does not meet the objective requirements allowing it to aspire to such a desire .
<en> That said , I believe it advantageous that Georgia express this wish and try to comply with European standards .
<en> As such , and since it is intended to seek to help the country overcome the economic and social difficulties suffered after the military conflict , I am voting to grant Georgia additional macro-financial assistance , which I hope can be used to the real benefit of its population .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) This report is on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia .
<en> This is a European Commission proposal that provides for EUR 46 million in aid to this country and is the result of the armed conflict with Russia , a situation exacerbated by the global crisis .
<en> As this is the second part of aid guaranteed in 2008 , which is intended to enable Georgia to meet the financial agreements with global and European financial institutions , as well as to support the economic reforms in progress in this country , I agree with this aid and am voting for it .
<en> However , I hope that Parliament and the Council will soon reach an agreement on the methodology for supervising the implementation of this aid , so that we all have greater peace of mind about the proper application of EU funds .
<sp>
<2en> With regard to this proposed additional macro-financial assistance , the observations we made about the decision to grant the previous macro-financial assistance to this country remain valid and relevant .
<2en> We always advocate the EU 's need to grant assistance in solidarity with countries that need it , and for this assistance to be directed at projects that serve the interests of the people .
<2en> However , EU ' assistance ' has demonstrated that it has little to do with solidarity .
<2en> The interests of big companies and financial institutions , and of the major powers almost always overcome the genuine and real interests of solidarity .
<2en> It is no different with Georgia .
<2en> It is important to bear in mind that the proposed financial assistance is intended above all to finance the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and its policy of structural adjustment : in other words , persisting with the same neoliberal policies that led to the economic and financial crisis that this country is facing .
<2en> We also maintain the same reservations and concerns with regard to possible progress in terms of the militarisation of the Caucasus region as a result of the tensions with Russia , bearing in mind the region 's energy wealth and geostrategic importance , which arouses the greed of the EU and its monopolies .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> At the sitting of 6 September 2010 , the President announced that he had received a letter sent by the Central District Court of Budapest on 6 July 2010 requesting the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Hankiss , pursuant to Rule 6 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<2en> The President referred the request to the Committee on Legal Affairs pursuant to the same Rule .
<2en> The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs , which was voted for unanimously , concluded that the present case does not come within the scope of the political activities of Mrs Hankiss as a Member of this House .
<2en> It concerns instead a statement made in 2004 , long before she was elected a Member of this House .
<2en> The rapporteur has also found no evidence of fumus persecutionis : that is , a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member .
<2en> I therefore support the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and voted in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Hankiss .
<sp>
<2en> On 6 July 2010 , the Central District Court of Buda sent a request to waive the immunity of Ágnes Hankiss in connection with renewed criminal proceedings ordered by a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hungary in 2009 .
<2en> On 23 January 2004 , following a statement made during a programme , Mrs Hankiss was accused of an alleged offence of defamation of honour committed in public and , in particular , of defamation of the memory of a dead person .
<2en> In an appeal hearing on 25 March 2009 , the Budapest Municipal Court acquitted Mrs Hankiss of the charges , but , on 12 November 2009 , the Hungarian Supreme Court ordered a renewed procedure to be conducted by the Central District Court of Buda .
<2en> The renewed proceedings were opened on 31 March 2010 and suspended the same day because of Mrs Hankiss 's parliamentary immunity .
<2en> For these reasons , and because the case does not come within the scope of Mrs Hankiss 's political activities as a Member of the European Parliament , since it concerns a statement made long before she was elected a Member , I am voting in favour of waiving her parliamentary immunity .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - In favour .
<en> The case relates to an alleged offence of defamation which does not come within the scope of Ms Hankiss ' political activities as an MEP , but relates instead to a statement made in 2004 , before she was elected an MEP .
<en> The rapporteur has also found no evidence of fumus persecutionis .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting in favour of this report as it covers the Commission 's objectives of simplifying the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses , mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of textile products .
<sp>
<2en> Regulation ( EC ) No 1541 / 98 and Regulation ( EEC ) No 3030 / 93 , which were initially adopted in order to implement trade policy measures in the textile sector , have now become obsolete instruments that constrain the free market and are poorly adapted to changes in the new regulatory environment .
<2en> Until recently , quantitative restrictions on imports originating in World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) member countries were in force , together with special safeguard provisions for textile products from the People 's Republic of China .
<2en> Those restrictions were eliminated with the expiry of the WTO agreement in 2005 , as were the provisions for China in 2008 .
<2en> Therefore , the only effective method of preventing distortions in the market and continuing to control textile imports is still to subject such imports to verification procedures that require indication of the country of origin .
<2en> That indication is , in fact , contained in the proposal for a regulation on ' Made in ' origin marking , which was adopted in this Chamber on 21 October 2010 , which introduces a control mechanism and aims to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better , clearer legislative framework for companies and for consumer protection .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I welcome EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries , which constitute a guarantee that the growth of the global economy will benefit everyone in the current globalised context .
<2en> I therefore support the conditions based on social values and human dignity imposed on third countries in order to negotiate with the EU .
<2en> It is through this type of Union that we will successfully use foreign policy to improve the situation in the world .
<sp>
<2en> The International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) plays a key role in the international system , as it contributes to building a consensus on labour standards .
<2en> A significant part of this important acquis is recognised by all EU Member States .
<2en> However , there remain differences in terms of labour legislation between developed and developing countries .
<2en> In my opinion , it is imperative for the EU that these standards with those of third countries be reconciled , particularly with key trade partners , so as to preserve a basic level of equality in international trade .
<2en> This report shares this belief , setting out some strategies for these countries to respect the same principles as the EU in labour terms .
<2en> The establishment of fair standards for working conditions is a premise essential to durable and sustainable development , and will also contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
<2en> I therefore believe that this report is a fairly valid contribution to the development of the system of international trade , which is based on labour relations that vary so much between countries / trade blocs .
<2en> I would argue that the promotion of this policy of responsibility for working conditions demonstrates a Europe that is attentive and thorough , and that conforms to defending universal values in which it believes .
<sp>
<2en> One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development .
<2en> If these two factors are in balance , then this means , on the one hand , that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality , while , on the other hand , it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles , though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place .
<2en> This perspective - which some people also call the social market economy - is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being .
<2en> Such a paradigm shift necessarily involves consistent support for social policy , including fostering the relevant standards and related corporate responsibility .
<2en> This approach and vision cannot , and must not , have an impact merely within the EU , but must also be applied to external action wherever possible , particularly during the negotiation of agreements .
<2en> Respect for International Labour Organisation standards , the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions .
<2en> I believe that the report we have adopted offers sound backing for these objectives .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The external dimension of social policy includes activities and initiatives of the EU aimed at promoting labour and social standards in non-member countries .
<en> The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to both European enterprises and EU and non-EU workers and citizens .
<en> Given the globalisation of industry and services , international labour standards are the basis for guaranteeing that the growth of the global economy can benefit all .
<en> This report demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement worker 's rights and working conditions , calling for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour .
<sp>
<2en> The external dimension of social policy is aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries and at combating social dumping , often the result of globalisation or international trade .
<2en> The Union can no longer tolerate dumping in terms of welfare , health and the environment without reacting to it , as it is responsible for far too many transfers of production outside Europe .
<2en> The ridiculously low labour costs and despicable working conditions should no longer be seen by the Commission as ' natural competitive advantages ' .
<2en> On this point , I insist that the Commission changes its doctrine .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Cohesion policy is the best proof of the solidarity which exists in the European Union .
<2en> Poland , and in particular poor regions like the one I represent - Lubelskie Voivodship - have used these funds for rapid development .
<2en> Today it is hard to imagine what our region would be like without EU support .
<2en> It is a pity that there is a lack of information about the specific effects of spending this money , because in fact it is research evaluating the way in which the whole region has used a variety of programmes , and not evaluation of individual programmes , which should suggest the way forward for cohesion policy in future years .
<2en> Cohesion policy is a pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy , so the money allocated to cohesion policy in the next common financial framework should not be less than the amounts made available in the current programming period .
<2en> We are currently looking for resources for new objectives which are to increase Europe 's competitiveness .
<2en> We should not , however , look for these at the cost of cities and regions .
<2en> In the report of the Policy Challenges Committee and in the Pieper report the European Parliament has sent a strong message to the governments of the Member States and the Council : do not tamper with cohesion policy .
<sp>
<2en> In its report on the future strategy for the post-2013 cohesion policy , the European Parliament proposes a balanced position which is favourable to the European Union .
<2en> The Union continues to need a strong cohesion policy which will also be financed accordingly .
<2en> At the same time , regulations need to be improved .
<2en> Other requirements include projects with large European added value , fairness , responsibility and a commitment from Member States , based on a contract with the European Commission , to use the total amount of allocated funds .
<2en> During a period of economic decline , investments are needed to preserve jobs and foster development .
<2en> Cohesion policy is targeted exclusively at investments .
<2en> For the future financial year , the budget allocated to cohesion policy must be at least equivalent to the current level .
<sp>
<2en> Cohesion policy after 2013 should continue to be an important factor in the development of Europe .
<2en> It must guarantee infrastructure development and correct the imbalances in development between individual regions .
<2en> The financial crisis has further exacerbated regional differences .
<2en> Europe is confronting large-scale unemployment .
<2en> At present , when there are more than 23 million unemployed , cohesion policy is one of the policies that can also contribute to creating new jobs .
<2en> There is perhaps not a single MEP who doubts the need for cohesion policy to continue after 2013 .
<2en> The question of efficient use of funds , transparency and improvement of the overall process , and return on investment is becoming topical .
<2en> The successes of cohesion policy are measurable and are very much noticed and applauded by inhabitants of the EU .
<2en> It is therefore also important that cohesion policy is given sufficient funding when the Multiannual Financial Framework is approved .
<2en> Investments in regional development are investments in the future and the development of the EU .
<sp>
<2en> Pursuit of the objectives of European cohesion policy is undoubtedly moving in the right direction in many areas , although at this stage there are already some lessons which can be learned from its progress to date for the construction of the future priorities of European cohesion policy .
<2en> The relatively poor take-up of funds for infrastructure and the environment has given rise to the need for a review of the tools which offer encouragement to begin projects in this area .
<2en> This is particularly important for the countries of Eastern Europe , in which spending of funds allocated for this purpose is lower in comparison with other strategic areas .
<2en> Furthermore , additional support is required for transnational and cross-border cooperation , which is needed from the point of view of development and European convergence , and for the accomplishment of joint regional projects in the area of infrastructure and the environment .
<2en> Another important element is the strengthening of development based on small and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> What is important here is not only to stimulate the establishment of new enterprises , but to create suitable conditions for them to survive in the market .
<2en> This gives rise to the need to achieve greater integration of the principles of the Small Business Act with cohesion policy .
<2en> Consideration given to these areas in the construction of post-2013 strategy and cohesion policy can contribute to the lasting and harmonious economic development of the European Union .

<2en> The introduction of this common platform of rights for all consumers within the Union represents a real step forward for the citizens of other countries where consumer information requirements are not as high and where the period for withdrawal is less well protected .
<2en> However , it has given mixed results , as the aim of the Commission and the European right has been above all to facilitate cross-border trade , and not to harmonise upwards consumer protection .
<2en> It is therefore a small step for the French consumer but a big step for the European consumer .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - It is important to underline the necessity of consumer rights , particularly those related to online purchases , in this and future reports in this area .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) This directive aims to simplify and complete the legislative framework in force , by merging the four existing directives into a single legislative instrument .
<en> These directives only provide for minimal harmonisation clauses and leave the adoption of more rigorous rules to the discretion of the Member States .
<en> This has contributed to an enormous fragmentation at EU level and high compliance costs for businesses in cross-border transactions .
<en> There is a need to establish a true internal market between businesses and consumers that is able to contribute to a fair balance between a high level of consumer protection and businesses ' competitiveness , but also to ensure respect for the subsidiarity principle .
<en> That would enable consumers to have access to competitive cross-border offers , benefitting from better choice , better prices and the clear advantages of the internal market , whilst also enabling them to place greater trust in a high level of protection of their rights .
<en> At the same time , it will enable companies to provide goods and services without being subjected to unnecessary legal obstacles .
<en> I agree that the ideal solution would be an approach of total harmonisation , as initially proposed by the Commission and requested by several spheres of business .
<en> However , unfortunately , that approach is still unfeasible at this stage ...
<en> ( Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<2en> I welcome this vote , which is a significant step forwards for the internal market and the fruit of complex and involved negotiations .
<2en> We now await the Council 's formal approval .
<2en> I consider it important for the European Parliament to continue to play a part in monitoring the directive 's implementation by the Member States over the next two years .
<2en> While the adoption of the directive is an important result , its transposition into national law is in fact the key stage in ensuring that the legislation is properly implemented by the Member States and that no obstacles or barriers to the single market are created .
<2en> With this directive , European consumers will gain new rights enshrined at European level and transcending national borders .
<2en> This will most certainly increase cross-border trade and boost online trade , which is the real challenge for businesses and the economic recovery of the market .
<sp>
<2en> Today , Parliament adopted the amended text of the Consumer Rights Directive of my fellow Member , Mr Schwab .
<2en> I welcome the adoption of this directive which will contribute to strengthening the platform of common consumer protection regulations , in particular with reference to the sale of goods online .
<2en> I also welcome the fact that the legislator has allowed the Member States to include provisions that are more favourable to consumers in their respective national legal systems .
<2en> Conversely , like numerous consumer associations , I deplore the fact that options have been provided so that Member States can bypass certain provisions in the directive with commercial or sector interests in mind .

<en> in writing . - ( RO ) This proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances intends to improve the Commission 's proposals on creating a powerful instrument where fiscal discipline , economic growth and employment in the EU are interconnected and make a crucial contribution to the stability of the European Union and the euro , with the aim of avoiding future financial crises like the current one .
<en> This regulation is intended to be a standard instrument for preventing macroeconomic imbalances which may occur as a result of economic disparities between EU Member States and of individual policies implemented nationally .
<en> It should be noted that this report is drafted on the basis of prior experience within the EU on the functioning of the economic and monetary union , which identifies the need for an enhanced economic governance framework , as is proposed in this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as it was an improvement on the original Commission text .
<en> I particularly welcome the provisions for upholding workers ' rights and the importance of a comprehensive assessment of economic performance , particularly including employment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Labour Euro MPs are fundamentally opposed to the current , austerity-only , direction of the economic governance package .
<en> Improved coordination on economic and fiscal policy , particularly within the Eurozone , would be good for Europe 's long term economic growth but must be based on the right rules .
<en> The text negotiated by the right wing majorities in Parliament , Council and the Commission puts too much emphasis on short term , severe cuts to deficits , not long term growth .
<en> These rules would be imposed across the European Union , removing the flexibility for national governments to respond with different policies in the future .
<en> Long term growth keeps debt falling as a proportion of GDP , and is essential to providing jobs and economic well-being and funding high quality public services .
<en> To ensure this package supports economic growth , investment spending must be protected .
<en> Investment in scientific research , vital infrastructure and the new green economy is crucial to long term growth and should never be cut back to meet short term EU targets .
<en> Cutting such spending in times of recession would also worsen an economic downturn .
<en> Labour Euro MPs support the improvements secured to the Commission proposal on macroeconomic imbalances in the Ferreira report , which uphold workers ' rights and the importance of a comprehensive assessment of economic performance , including employment .
<sp>
<2en> The Commission will now be able to give out good and bad marks at will .
<2en> It will itself be introducing the indicators which will allow it to give marks to the Member States .
<2en> There will also be sanctions for those who do not follow the ' recommendations ' that will then be imposed .
<2en> The Commission will be able to implement them in a semi-automatic fashion , thanks to reversed qualified majority voting .
<2en> The Commission will even make the decisions when it comes to imposing sanctions .
<2en> This is a masterpiece of authoritarianism .
<2en> I am voting against this democratic aberration , which I condemn .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The targets identified in terms of economic growth , employment and competitiveness cannot be attained through the planned measures because the economic development of the Member States is being stifled .
<en> A framework for controlling economic policy can perhaps be implemented by the various constituent Member States , but not by the EU as a whole , because the strength of the different national economies varies so much .
<en> That is why the euro area should be dissolved as quickly as possible .
<en> The strong states should unite to form a new monetary union and the others should return to their own currencies .
<en> A call for the surveillance of national economic policies in the present situation would mean socialist state intervention , something that failed in the past and that is one of the reasons for the current financial difficulties in the euro area .
<en> There is little democratic legitimisation for such measures , which is why I voted against this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this recommendation , and my reasons go far beyond the candidate 's nationality .
<2en> In fact , I do not think that it is Italy rather than the EU that will benefit from the appointment of Professor Draghi .
<2en> Quite the opposite .
<2en> Italy is losing a Governor of the Central Bank who is highly competent and very aware of economic , monetary and real problems .
<2en> We are talking about someone with an impeccable curriculum vitae and significant international experience in public and private institutions , someone who has always been extremely proactive ( as for instance in his chairmanship of the Financial Stability Forum ) .
<2en> His publications are testimony to an academic profile that is undoubtedly on a level with the tasks he has to carry out , and his experience in the monetary field must cast aside any doubts about his abilities .
<2en> It is no coincidence that the consensus on his appointment has been so unanimous .
<2en> He has all the requisites for being an excellent President of the European Central Bank .
<2en> He faces some significant challenges , given the current situation .
<2en> I therefore sincerely wish him good luck .
<sp>
<2en> In this period of economic and financial crisis , it is imperative to have leaders and people in charge who can show composure and independence .
<2en> Jean-Claude Trichet , President of the European Central Bank , has managed during his mandate to resist pressure from Heads of State or Government .
<2en> His successor will have to show the same qualities and be just as uncompromising .
<2en> I voted in favour of Italian Mr Draghi 's candidacy , since he enjoys an excellent reputation and he made a good impression during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
<2en> His career path , especially his experience as Governor of the Italian Central Bank , will enable him , I hope , to manage in the best possible way the many challenges that await him at the helm of the European Central Bank .
<sp>
<2en> The academic and professional background of Mr Draghi , as well as his hearing before Parliament , have shown that he has a deep understanding of , and clear ideas about , the necessary deepening of economic governance in the EU , and also about the importance of the stability of the euro for the resumption of growth .
<2en> Given this and the importance of the office of President of the European Central Bank , I believe that Mr Draghi fulfils all the conditions to perform the mandate for which he has now been nominated with skill and dedication .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SK ) In May 2011 , the European Council , together with Parliament , proposed the appointment of Mario Draghi as President of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) for an eight-year term of office , starting on 1 November 2011 .
<en> The parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs interviewed the candidate , and he answered questions put by committee members .
<en> He spoke , for example , about the Greek debt , and among other things expressed the opinion that the ECB should not rest in its efforts to maintain currency stability .
<en> The committee subsequently recommended the appointment of Mr Draghi .
<en> Since the candidate meets the requirements set for filling the post of ECB President , I would also like to express support for his appointment to this role .
<sp>
<2en> Although the vote on appointing certain European oligarchs is , according to regulation , a secret ballot , I am keen to let it be known that I voted against Mr Draghi , . because there is really something deeply unhealthy and perverse , in the middle of the sovereign debt crisis , about appointing a former European director of Goldman Sachs .
<2en> The period during which he carried out his duties , as well as the nature of the latter , cannot escape your attention .
<2en> Unless he was just a mediocre director , and even if he was not the instigator , Mr Draghi could not have been unaware that the company he was working for orchestrated the massaging , seemingly legally yet dishonestly , of the Greek debt to justify Greece 's joining the euro .
<2en> Moreover , you cannot ignore the role of Goldman Sachs in the current speculation on sovereign debt , any more than its responsibilities in the economic and financial crisis , and the investigations it is undergoing in the United States .
<2en> The fact that Goldman Sachs appears on Mr Draghi 's CV puts him beyond the pale , thereby disqualifying him for this role .

<en> Question No 44 has been withdrawn .
<sp>
<en> Question No 45 by Allan Macartney ( H-0336 / 96 )
<en> Subject : Commission policy and criteria with regard to the need for NGOs to have expatriate presence in the countries where they work
<en> Many NGOs work through local organizations in developing countries , in recognition and support of the experience and capacity that exists in those countries .
<en> In the past , the Commission has supported this approach and encouraged European development NGOs to work with local counterparts .
<en> In the fields of food aid , rehabilitation and longer-term development , the Commission has on numerous occasions stressed the importance of civil society and private initiatives in developing countries .
<en> Yet , on other occasions , Commission services have turned down applications by European development NGOs on the grounds that those organizations do not have sufficient expatriate presence in the country concerned .
<en> What criteria do the Commission apply in determining whether there is a need for European NGOs to have an expatriate presence in a particular country ?
<en> What are the advantages for the Commission and for the NGO programmes of the use of expatriate European staff as opposed to staff of local organizations ?
<en> Does the Commission agree that , in the light of its discussions on the linkages between emergency aid , rehabilitation and long-term development , there is added value in strengthening local organizations by working through them ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the Commission entirely agrees with Mr Macartney that it is important to strengthen local organizations and enhance their role in guaranteeing the linkages between emergency aid , rehabilitation and development .
<en> The importance of this aspect was especially highlighted in the recent Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on this very issue .
<en> Generally speaking , the Commission bears in mind , as far as possible , the need to strengthen and implicate local partners in the execution of the various financial instruments .
<en> Against this background , as far as possible , NGOs must resort to local staffing , as mentioned in the very conditions of co-funding for executing structural development projects .
<en> It is obvious that this approach must be adapted according to the specific aims of the different budget rubrics and in situ conditions .
<en> When assessing requirements for an expatriate presence for a given project , the Commission bears in mind the objective of the given project , the country 's logistic and technical capacity in terms of the planned action , the experience and financial management capacity of the beneficiaries .
<en> As a result in emergency situations and / or during the rehabilitation stage in countries which have just undergone serious crises and whose political , economic and social structure has suffered profound upheaval , it may be necessary to resort to a greater expatriate presence than , for example , in normal development stages .
<en> Resorting to expatriate aid workers is usually done so along with a unit of training staff to teach the local people so that the project 's viability in the medium or long term can be guaranteed once the foreign staff have left .
<sp>
<en> I do not know whether to be reassured or otherwise by the Commissioner 's response .
<en> He seemed to be saying all the right things .
<en> If I could just clarify it a bit , did I correctly understand him to say that , other things being equal , he would prefer to rely on local staff in NGOs rather than having Europeans acting to some extent as minders , which I take it could well be the perception ?
<en> The reason I ask that is because , after many years of decolonization , there is still an impression in some countries that the European Union has not changed its basic mentality .
<en> I hope I am wrong and perhaps he could confirm that I am wrong in that regard .
<sp>
<en> Let me reassure you that you are right in your concerns but wrong in your subsequent conjectures .
<en> In fact , in 1995 , of the 67 projects which we financed under the budget lines that are mainly concerned with rehabilitation and crisis management , only seven of those projects fell into the category to which you referred in your question , in which reinforcement of European personnel was required .
<en> The reason was that the administration was in a shambles and it really was not possible to carry out some essential projects if we did not contribute some expertise of our own .
<en> But the principle is that unless there is a local partner - we always try to be the main force in the project - we simply do not finance the European NGOs .
<en> This is a very strong principle .
<en> You will see that in the report we are presenting to the Council and Parliament at the beginning of next year that this is set out as one of our main objectives .
<en> Thank you for the question because it is an important one .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The actions of individual countries in taking measures to deal with this problem are commendable but the real lesson for the European Union , not only in this matter but in all others , is that our unity is our strength and therefore the real vigour and strength of reaction and the effect both in dealing with this measure and deterring comparable measures will be in direct proportion to our unity and rapidity of response .
<en> Therefore I hope that a call will come from this Chamber to the Council of Ministers to respond urgently and rapidly to the preparations the Commission has made for rapid and effective action to defend ourselves .
<en> Let us be strong .
<en> The best way of being strong is by being united .
<sp>
<2en> In your introductory statement you yourself pointed out that Helms-Burton is merely the tip of the iceberg , that the United States is also drafting legislation on a number of other states which , geographically at least , are closer to Europe .
<2en> However important it may be to keep the effects of the Helms-Burton legislation on the European economy or on Europe and the world in general within bounds , in my view it is just as important , not to say urgent , to ensure that the Americans - regardless of their concerns in this matter and the understanding we have for these concerns - do not start including other countries and other economic areas in their legislation too .
<2en> What is the Commission doing in this regard ?
<sp>
<en> I very much agree with that .
<en> We cannot deal with legislation which has not been enacted .
<en> We have on the statute book so far the Helms-Burton legislation and the D 'Amato legislation .
<en> That gives us quite a lot to deal with and we are dealing with it rapidly and I hope vigorously - certainly as long as the Commission has anything to do with it .
<en> But I actually believe that taking this action is in the best interests not only of the European Union but of the United States as well .
<en> There are many people in the United States who realize that what has been done was done in haste and things done in haste are very rarely wise .
<en> They also realize that it damages the American leadership role in the world .
<en> I believe the world will be a better place if Europe and the United States can work together and anything that damages that cooperation is not only against the interests of Europe but also against the interests of the United States .
<en> Therefore , standing up to the United States , discouraging such future legislation , is something which will help us in the long term to work together better .
<en> I do not expect it to be seen exactly like that in Washington today but I believe it to be the truth .
<sp>
<en> I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement and congratulate him on the measures which he has taken .
<en> I believe he will know that Parliament has gone on record against the Helms-Burton legislation on a number of occasions , once in a report which I introduced here .
<en> We have made it very clear at the same time that we believe in progress in democracy in Cuba .
<en> This , however , is the worst possible means of seeking to achieve that .
<en> Does the Commissioner agree that it is important that we should put all possible pressure on at the present time because after the American presidential election this may be looked at in quite a different light ?
<en> In those circumstances , will the Commissioner consider what other actions can be taken through the World Trade Organization , through GATT and in other respects which some of my colleagues have mentioned this afternoon ?
<en> The pressure put on now is absolutely vital for the final result we wish to achieve .
<sp>
<en> I entirely agree with Mr Newens .
<en> We are proceeding through a process of consultation , which is a necessary preliminary to going to a panel , so the Commission has already gone ahead as far as the WTO is concerned .
<en> But I am not just being ordinarily and customarily polite in saying that the role of this Parliament is important .
<en> This legislation comes from Congress even though the Administration has to take the responsibility for not vetoing it .
<en> That means that when the next Congress is elected it will be vitally important for all of us , but obviously most particularly for members of other legislatures , to establish early contact with the members of that Congress .
<en> Whatever the outcome , there will be lots of new members and one of the problems in the past has been a lack of knowledge and sometimes a lack of interest in European affairs by the recent , rather radical Congress .
<en> I hope , therefore , when the new Congress is elected , that we can all in our different ways make a real effort to explain the true path of cooperation between Europe and the United States and the pitfalls that must be avoided .
<en> I am sure they will tell us the pitfalls that we also should avoid and we should be ready to listen to them as well as tell them what we think should be done and should be avoided .

<en> Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether she regards the regulation of nickel-cadmium batteries as more important than the regulation of the Internet , in particular , control of child pornography which is currently accessible on the Internet .
<sp>
<en> Commissioner , do you want to answer that ?
<en> I think that was an unfair way of Mr Truscott getting his first question across .
<sp>
<2en> To be honest , I believe the President answered that question a moment ago when a question was raised concerning procedure .
<2en> As is fitting for a member of the Commission , I have answered the question which Parliament asked , and it is Parliament which decides what is ' urgent ' .
<sp>
<en> As the author is not present , Question No 27 lapses .
<en> I am afraid the discipline of our Members is excruciating today .
<en> Mrs Cresson , I give you my full apologies .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the Commission is well aware of the importance of the public health problem which diabetes represents , particularly in an ageing population such as the population of Europe today .
<en> It is also entirely aware of the formidable progress , for people suffering from this disease , that the introduction of the therapeutic use of insulin represented when it was discovered 75 years ago .
<en> It is not unaware of the positive spin-offs of research into diabetes in several fields or of the interest presented by this research in understanding and treating other chronic diseases .
<en> Research into diabetes thus benefits from a great deal of attention in research programmes in the Union .
<en> One thread of the Biomed research programme , of the fourth framework programme , is devoted to it explicitly .
<en> Within this framework , nine research projects have been launched which cover both the epidemiological aspects and clinical research .
<en> Furthermore , the genetic aspects of diabetes are studied in the part of the programme dedicated to research into the human genome , and , as you know , research into the human genome has recently made some important developments , and this is one of the success stories of European research .
<en> Because of both its importance and its interest , research into diabetes is set to continue as the subject of sustained attention in the fifth framework programme of research and technological development which we are currently in the process of getting under way .
<en> But the fight against diabetes also involves prevention .
<en> The prevention of diabetes by the adaptation of one 's lifestyle and diet in particular has been registered as one of the themes of the educational , training and health promotion activities which are carried out within the scope of the European Union 's public health policy .
<en> Since the financial resources made available for this policy are fairly limited , action for prevention remains modest in comparison with requirements .
<en> It would therefore be very useful if we could sensitise Member States to the importance of a more sustained effort in this area .
<en> I would like to thank in every instance the honourable Members who have drawn the attention of the Commission to this problem and I will certainly take account of these concerns in the preparation for the fifth framework programme of research .

<en> The Council regrets that the parliamentary assembly of the OSCE and the ODIHR did not participate in the observation of the local elections in Albania .
<en> The Council had made clear to the Albanian Government the strong view of the European Union and the ODIHR that the latter should participate in the monitoring of the elections .
<en> We also urged the Albanian Government to take all measures necessary to ensure that the elections were held in a free and fair manner under procedures and conduct that meet acceptable international standards for the democratic process .
<en> The Council has noted that over 300 international observers monitored the elections , including observers from several Member States of the European Union .
<en> We have also noted that the Council of Europe which coordinated the international monitoring operation has said that it is generally satisfied that the elections were held in a free and fair manner despite isolated irregularities in certain districts .
<en> While we welcome this initial assessment as a positive step in the right direction , the Council will consider further the final reports on the conduct of the elections from the international monitors , when they are available , before arriving at a conclusion on the acceptability of the elections and their outcome .
<en> The Albanian Government has assured the European Union of its wish to make progress in the area of democratic and constitutional reform .
<en> The Council continues to urge the Albanian Government to give early and practical effect to these assurances and to expedite implementation of reform measures .
<sp>
<2en> I am grateful for the answer .
<2en> It is quite right , as the Council 's representative says , that these local elections were conducted for the most part correctly .
<2en> But we are still concerned about a government which bases its power on a blatant electoral fraud in ordinary parliamentary elections .
<2en> My view is that we should put constant pressure on this government on behalf of the Union .
<2en> The obvious question to the Council is : Are you making such demands upon the government in Albania , for example demands for new elections ?
<2en> Are you threatening , planning or considering , for example , any kind of economic sanctions against the government because of its refusal to undertake proper new parliamentary elections ?
<sp>
<en> We must always recall that economic sanctions are not against the government , they are against the people and it is the people of Albania who will suffer if there are economic sanctions .
<en> Anyone who has any knowledge of Albania will know that the people of that country are suffering very much already .
<en> The Council wishes to maintain and deepen relations with Albania .
<en> We acknowledge the progress which has been made to date by Albania in reforming its economy and in seeking to move towards a multi-party democracy .
<en> We consider it appropriate that this progress be encouraged further and assisted through closer contractual relations with the European Union .
<en> The Union first established contractual links with Albania in 1992 and in due course the Commission will submit a draft mandate to the Council for negotiations with Albania regarding a new bilateral agreement .
<en> This presents us with certain opportunities to pursue the line suggested by the honourable Member .
<en> We wish Albania to understand clearly that the European Union will only be able to continue to develop its political and economic relations with Albania if progress on the introduction of democratic reforms continue to be made .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to ask whether it is not the case that the elections in Albania actually confirm the results of the national elections .
<2en> After all , the result of the municipal elections was the same as the result of the national elections , and the municipal elections were generally regarded as fair , so to that extent they confirm the national elections .
<2en> So I would like to ask you whether Albania does not differ from neighbouring states in this respect .
<2en> For example , consider events in Kosovo .
<2en> At the latest elections there , no progress was made .
<2en> I should be interested to know the Council 's view on this .
<2en> I must also ask whether it would not make sense to expand economic relations with Albania instead of cutting them back , as a way of giving further impetus to the process of reform in that country .
<sp>
<en> The honourable Member will understand from my previous answers that the European Union , and certainly the Council of Ministers , sees possibilities for developing relations with Albania and influencing it in that way .
<en> In relation to the election results , as I have already said , we welcome the initial assessment but we will consider the final reports on the conduct of the elections from the international monitors before we make up our minds on the fairness or otherwise of the elections .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a kind of compensation I should like to speak in English now .
<en> The Commission greatly appreciates the fact that both the European Parliament , in particular the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control , and the European Court of Auditors have taken an early , active and , I would add , supportive interest in this first major CFSP joint action of the European Union .
<en> The Commission , as well as the Union Administration in their joint official reply to the Court of Auditors ' report , have expressed their basic agreement with its findings and recommendations .
<en> Mrs Müller 's report broadly endorses these findings by elaborating on the mainly institutional lessons which should be drawn from this unique experience .
<en> We share the conclusion of the motion for a resolution that this joint action was justified and worthwhile , although not all its goals have been achieved and that it provides valuable lessons for the future .
<en> This is not the place to discuss in detail all the points stressed by the resolution , many of which are indeed on the agenda of the IGC and all need careful consideration .
<en> Certainly , political and administrative procedures need streamlining in the future .
<en> Financial accountability has to be clarified .
<en> Proper preparation , follow-up and supervision by a permanent structure could greatly improve efficiency .
<en> The same is true of exclusive financing from the Community budget .
<en> Recommendation No 14 encourages the Commission to propose new joint actions in the former Yugoslavia , in particular for the return of refugees and support for independent media .
<en> The Commission is , however , of the opinion that with the exception of support for the Office of the High Representative , it has sufficient instruments and budget resources under the first pillar to meet well-identified needs .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Commissioner .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> We will now proceed to the vote .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<sp>
<2en> I find it very sad that our final debate concerns a failure of EU policy in which so many people have invested much energy and Mr Koschnick personally has risked so much .
<2en> This first project was to have been a model of the common foreign policy .
<2en> Well , our efforts in reconstruction have to some degree been successful , but our political efforts have not been at all .
<2en> Partly thanks to an unclear division of powers over the allocation of funds at decisive moments with Council and Commission decisions contradicting each other .
<2en> I will not go into the details .
<2en> The Court of Auditors and Mrs Müller have done an excellent job .
<2en> But what is clear is that the Union is struggling over its foreign policy .
<2en> This report by the Court of Auditors is thus politically heavily loaded and Parliament cannot allow that to happen in future .
<2en> It cannot be allowed to get through the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference on the nod .
<2en> Otherwise Parliament will look foolish .
<2en> This has to be followed up .
<2en> Happy Christmas and a Happy New Year .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Mrs van Bladel .

<en> Madam President , I am very surprised by the tone adopted by the Commissioner this evening , whereas during the preparatory work there was an excellent atmosphere in our relations , between the Commission and its services and ours .
<en> Both Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Castricum made remarks , of a political and technical nature respectively .
<en> I think that everyone here was taken aback by this enumeration of the amendments that have been refused , often without very detailed explanations .
<en> I go along with my colleagues and think that in future we should take a quite different approach .
<en> I also found the closing remarks made by the Commissioner a little out of order .

<en> Madam President , if I respond in a tone which is candid and forceful , it is because I respect this House and do not treat it like some kind of toy parliament .
<en> So that when directly elected Members of the European Parliament say to me , ' do not turn up with a list of responses , ' I am bound to ask them what they want in terms of accountability from the European Commission .
<en> Now I do not mind being criticized , I do not mind the substance of what I am saying being attacked , but I am not going to be criticized because I have been trying to respond to the detailed arguments and the considerations put by Members of this House , especially when my services spend endless days continually trying to cooperate with and meet the concerns of Members of the Parliament , as do my cabinet , as indeed I do myself .
<en> And when a political point is made , I , as a politician to my bone marrow , respond politically .
<sp>
<en> After that rather lively debate , which shows the interest that members and the Commissioner all take in this matter , I declare the debate closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the main request is to be able to bring the report forward to a more suitable time on Tuesday or Wednesday .
<2en> If that is not possible , the secondary request is to defer it to a future part-session at a suitable time .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I wish to oppose that , because this report is a good one , and it would be a pity if we were to adjourn it .
<2en> Whether it is dealt with on Wednesday or Thursday really makes no difference .
<2en> I see no earthly reason , in any case , why we should adjourn the report .
<2en> I move that it should not be adjourned .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I understand Mr Scapagnini 's point but there is no space to bring this forward , without breaking up some of the very important debates we already have timetabled .
<en> My group would support taking it at a later part-session if Mr Scapagnini is not happy with its position on the agenda this month .
<sp>
<en> Well , now that we have heard that comment , I put to the House the proposal that the Scapagnini report should be brought forward to Wednesday .
<en> ( Parliament rejected the proposal )
<sp>
<en> I now put to the House the proposal to postpone the Scapagnini report .
<en> ( Parliament approved the proposal )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Since the time allocated to questions to Mr Marín has now expired , Questions Nos 31 and 32 will be answered in writing .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the Commission has already dealt twice with the subject matter which is again presented in the question .
<en> First , I have written a letter on this question to the Spanish government , and I have already commented on it once in the debate on the Green Paper on numbering here in Parliament .
<en> I will willingly repeat it .
<en> However , I must first correct the assumption in the question .
<en> The reference to the code number for Gibraltar in the Appendix to the Green Paper about a numbering plan is not in the ' Countries ' column , but in an untitled column , containing explanations of the actual use of certain code numbers , including quite different code numbers such as short codes for European services , telephone information , etc .
<en> Also , the code numbers which have a geographical meaning are not country codes but regional codes .
<en> The fact that the regional code for Gibraltar - which was not defined by us , but by the ITU - happens to be between those of Germany and Luxembourg has no political significance at all , but is the result of the numerical sequence of the table .
<en> It was therefore decisively important to include a reference to code number 350 , which is currently used for Gibraltar .
<en> That is , as I said during the debate , the table only gives an overview of technical data , based on facts .
<en> Nothing else !
<en> It does not take a political position .
<en> I said in the debate that if we were to change these facts now , by taking the code number out of the table or something similar , we would be making a political declaration , which the Commission never intended .
<en> Obviously , we would not get involved in this political question in favour of either side .
<en> That was not the intention of the table , and I hope that is now finally clear .
<en> We take the greatest possible care to be politically neutral in this question .
<sp>
<2en> Commissioner , you mention a reply that was given to the Spanish Government , which does not concern us in this House .
<2en> Also , you say that the column in question is empty , with no entries .
<2en> Nevertheless , I can read that it says " country 's dialling code ' .
<2en> You could have put " territorial dialling code ' or " dialling codes for Member States and territories whose foreign relations are dependent on a Member State ' , or anything you like .
<2en> But " country ' means country , whether the word is used in a political document or an annex to a political document , which is what this is .
<2en> Therefore , I would ask you , Mr Bangemann , to please reconsider the situation , because there is a resolution from this Parliament requesting you to do so .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the question has just been repeated again .
<2en> I have already said : If you look at the column on the far left , there is country code today , and then indeed comes 350 .
<2en> In the column on the right , where the proposals are , it says quite clearly : regional code .
<2en> For this reason , we refrained from changing it , because that would have been a political declaration .
<2en> But I would like to ask you to take account of what I have said .
<2en> It is the same as what is in the letter .
<2en> Fine , the letter does not concern you , but it may interest you that we also said clearly in this letter to the Spanish government that this is not a political statement .
<2en> It does not mean that we recognize Gibraltar as an independent country .
<2en> The fact that the number was assigned to Gibraltar has nothing to do with us , but is a decision of the ITU .
<2en> I have already said in the debate that we do not associate any political motivation with it , and I say once again as the answer to your question : We do not take any position in this way to one or the other claim of one of the two countries which cannot agree about this question .
<2en> I think that must be enough !

<en> Question No 34 by Robin Teverson ( H-0779 / 97 )
<en> Subject : The Millennium ' Bug '
<en> Every owner of a computer is being faced with the potential collapse of his / her computer after the year 2000 simply because of the short-sightedness of the computer industry who have failed to program their products with the information necessary to function after the start of the new Millennium .
<en> What action is the Commission undertaking to deal with the potential catastrophic repercussions of this ' Millennium Bug ' , as it is now known , not only throughout the European Union but also within the Commission itself ?
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , first of all , I should like to remind you that , on behalf of my group , I tabled an oral question on the visit by the Veterinary Committee to Portugal because I should like to be told of the findings of that visit .
<2en> We already know that an embargo has been introduced but I would like to remind the House of something with reference to the Rules of Procedure .
<2en> An extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture was convened for the sole purpose of voting on Mr Görlach 's report on rural development , although it was not on the agenda but was the result of a gentlemen 's agreement - if indeed there are still any gentlemen in this Parliament .
<2en> Yet the Commission took that opportunity to hear Dr Joachim Heine on the matter of BSE in Portugal , even though no Portuguese Member of Parliament was present .
<2en> The underhand , clandestine and cowardly way in which the Commission often acts - even when it is right - is a disgrace .
<2en> I am not saying that the Commission was not right to do this .
<2en> But it is not enough to be right ; you have to know how to be right and the Commission does not know .
<2en> That is what I regret so deeply .
<2en> I am calling on the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture , who is indeed a gentlemen and behaved as one , to do whatever is necessary to recall Dr Heine so that we can hear what our German colleagues have said about Portugal , whether or not they are right .
<2en> They should hold their tongues and show a little more common sense !
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Rosado .
<en> We shall investigate what has happened in the Committee on Agriculture .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , with the presence of the delegates from the Northern Ireland Assembly Parliament has again welcomed the agreement with a standing ovation of several minutes , and I wish to say that we too share in this celebration , as we did last time .
<2en> I asked to speak , however , in order to say that we have drawn a conclusion which I think could be the European Parliament 's conclusion too .
<2en> What has been happening for decades in Northern Ireland is not exactly the same as what is happening in Kosovo , though there are important similarities .
<2en> And , Mr President , in Ireland there was no need either for unilateral military intervention by America or by NATO .
<2en> We reached a national ...
<2en> ( The President cut the speaker off )
<sp>
<en> Mr Ephremidis , this is not a debate on Kosovo , and we are not going to debate Kosovo just because a number of guests from Ireland are present .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to express my appreciation to the President for his opening address and to all those who sent messages of condolence to my home town , Gothenburg , where 63 young people died recently in a fire .
<2en> I am sure that the messages brought great comfort , and now our thoughts should be with the survivors , both the young people who still live near the scene of the fire and their parents .

<en> The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I wish to raise a matter which is not covered by yesterday 's minutes .
<en> However , it is a serious matter .
<en> Many of us today will be travelling home by plane .
<en> Many of us will be using the services of the company LSG Lufthansa Skychef .
<en> I wish to report to this House that last week four hundred workers who took part in a legally called strike were summarily dismissed by that company .
<en> I hope that all Members of the European Parliament will complain about this outrageous breach of human rights .
<sp>
<en> Mrs McNally , that is a matter for individual Members .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to return to page 17 of the Minutes .
<2en> Yesterday evening , at the start of the discussion on the Rothley report on the Members ' Statute , I tabled a preliminary question pursuant to Rule 128 .
<2en> Under this Rule , the President should have asked if there was a speaker in favour and a speaker against the motion , before putting it to the vote .
<2en> No doubt mistakenly advised , the President of the sitting decided of his own accord - as is stated in the Minutes - that the report I contested was perfectly admissible .
<2en> I should like you to use this incident , which I consider to be very serious simply because it calls into question the rights of Members and the application of the Rules of Procedure , as an opportunity to give instructions , both to those who substitute for you as President of the sitting and to all the advisers , that the Rules of Procedure are to be applied and that the rights of the majority should not take precedence over the legal position of minorities .
<2en> The interpretation given was clearly mistaken and I should like you to formally confirm this today .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , yesterday , pursuant to the Rules of Procedure , as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has just explained , he questioned the admissibility of Mr Rothley 's report .
<2en> So far , Mr Fabre-Aubrespy , who is very familiar with the Rules of Procedure , has acted entirely within his rights .
<2en> I myself , aware of the responsibility vested in me when I occupy the position which is yours today , Mr President , decided that in this case , admissibility could not be questioned .
<2en> I announced my decision accordingly and assume full responsibility for it .
<2en> So far , so good .
<2en> However , I feel there is something inadmissible in what Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has said .
<2en> I cannot accept that he should attribute my political prerogative , my full political responsibility , to the President 's advisers .
<2en> Those who advise the Chair may express an opinion , but the President must take full political responsibility for his decisions .
<2en> Consequently , Mr Fabre-Aubrespy , if you have any objections , you should address them to the President , not to officials .
<2en> I therefore invite you to withdraw your remarks .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I abstained in some of the votes on this report because I could not find a Swedish version .
<en> There were no English or Danish versions available either , so I was forced to familiarise myself with the text in German .
<en> Unfortunately , my German is not of a sufficiently high standard for me to be confident that I had understood the various points .
<en> I therefore abstained in some of the votes .
<en> Caccavale report ( A4-0430 / 98 )
<sp>
<en> We welcome the strenuous efforts made by Latvia , not least in terms of adapting its legislation to meet the EU 's criteria in order to facilitate membership of the European Union in the future .
<en> The process of enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe gives us an historic opportunity to establish lasting peace based on the principles of freedom and democracy .
<en> It is vital that the EU should not betray the strong desire of the people of Latvia to see their country become a fully-fledged member of the European Union .
<en> The Commission should take this opportunity to send a clear signal to the people of Latvia that there will be no delay in opening negotiations .
<sp>
<en> It is gratifying that the European Parliament is in favour of opening membership negotiations with Latvia without further delay .
<en> Nevertheless , I do not strictly agree with the rapporteur 's reasons , when he ' notes the successes achieved by Latvia as regards the transition to a market economy , privatisation , containing inflation and balancing the budget ' .
<en> It is a pity that the economic criteria imposed on the applicant countries are so strongly geared towards privatisation and the market economy .
<en> Capitalism and a market economy are not the most effective or rational ways to produce and distribute resources .
<en> In a world where 40 000 children die every day from starvation and related diseases , where 80 % of its people consume 20 % of the resources while others are rolling in luxury , where 90 % of the financial capital is used up in unproductive speculation instead of investment , one only has to look around to see that what is required is democratic control of the economy .
<en> Together we need to create a society where people have control over their daily lives .
<en> The objective should be to achieve a method of production which includes compensation for the pursuit of profit , solidarity to compensate for competition , and democracy to compensate for ' economism ' .
<sp>
<en> The reports submitted to us today , on applicant countries which the Commission has relegated to second class , bring few new elements .
<en> They simply call for a review of the distinction between ' in ' and ' pre-in ' which would allow the countries placed in the second category to move up to the first category at any time on the basis of the extent to which they have adopted the ' acquis communautaire ' .
<en> While at the beginning of the decade the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the communist regimes raised hopes of a rapid political reunification of Europe which could have taken the form of a continental confederation , we now find that this has been prevented by the way in which we have pursued European unification and by the way in which we have fixed on the method of integration .
<en> Applicants for membership have been subjected to the humiliating procedure of ' sifting ' and have been judged solely on the basis of their ability to adapt to the Community machinery , rather than being immediately recognised as full European Member States .
<en> The confused approach to two totally different questions , namely economic and social reforms in these countries and political recognition as part of Europe , has resulted in a situation where it seems that we are haggling over their full status as Europeans , thereby fostering disappointment and resentment .
<en> It is also striking that the European Union as it is currently developing has no desire to benefit from the wealth of experience , culture and talent of the countries it is hoping to integrate , since it is so busy subjecting them to its merciless accounting and teaching them how to cannibalise their institutions .
<en> That is why , while ardently seeking European reunification , we can only regret the absence of a genuine debate on the nature of the European Union .
<en> The silence which we are now trying to impose may well not be able to stifle the people of eastern Europe , who are only too familiar with the lies of a superstate , as easily as some people think .

<sp>
<en> The rapporteur would like the European Parliament to ' encourage Romania ... to press on with the vital reforms , in particular the privatisation process ... '
<en> It should also be noted that it has unfortunately not been possible to recommend the opening of accession negotiations under the present circumstances , partly because democratic rights , such as freedom of the press , have still not been fully implemented in Romania , but mainly because the Romanian economy does not comply with the so-called Copenhagen criteria .
<en> I am delighted that the discussions are proceeding , since I am a strong supporter of EU enlargement .
<en> However , the European Union is a political project , not an economic one .
<en> I therefore think it is unfortunate that greater emphasis is placed on economic criteria than on democratic rights .
<en> As a Social Democrat , I am opposed to the EU being a ' rich man 's club ' .
<en> With regard to privatisation , I think that it this an issue which should be dealt with at national level .
<en> A certain amount of public ownership is nevertheless necessary in order to provide people with a satisfactory level of welfare .

<en> The human race is facing a serious threat to its survival , and it is essential that we resolve this problem quickly .
<en> The current rapid depletion of the ozone layer will have long-term consequences which it is impossible to predict today .
<en> There can scarcely ever have been clearer evidence of the need for cross-border cooperation - and we must act quickly .
<en> We know that the ozone layer is expected to become thinner in the next few years unless we reach agreement on a radical reduction in ozone-depleting substances .
<en> We therefore welcome the Commission 's initiative in putting forward a proposal to improve and tighten up the regulation on substances that deplete the ozone layer .
<en> We should also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Graenitz , on the admirable and skilful way in which she has dealt with this difficult and highly technical subject and on the amendments she has proposed , which include a further tightening-up of the Commission 's proposal .
<en> We know that the extent of the damage to the ozone layer is now greater than ever .
<en> We also know that depletion of the ozone layer will continue unabated during the next few years as a result of the long-lasting effects produced by ozone-depleting substances .
<en> Such a serious situation requires a strong and coordinated effort .
<en> It is therefore astonishing , and indeed shocking , that Parliament should even be considering the compromise amendments , let alone proposing that methyl bromide should continue to be used for agricultural purposes in some parts of the Union .
<en> We think it is important to fully appreciate the difficulties faced by some Member States in implementing Community legislation .
<en> What we fail to understand , however , is why , when the threat to the ozone layer is so great , we should permit the continued use of ozone-depleting substances when suitable alternatives exist .
<sp>
<en> On behalf of the members of the EPLP I would like to explain that they were unable to support Amendments Nos 32 , 33 , 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 and 10 of Mrs Graenitz 's report .
<en> We feel that Amendments Nos 32 and 33 would introduce an overlong and unnecessary extension of the widespread use of methyl bromide in many parts of the European Union whereas in other parts of the Union , its use has been eliminated and adequate alternatives found .
<en> Equally we are unable to support Amendment No 15 as this reintroduces a use for ozone depleting substances where there are now well established and better alternatives .
<en> With regard to Amendments Nos 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 we feel that the deadlines for phaseout of O.D.P. substances proposed by the Commission are practical and realistic and that advancing the schedules has little environmental benefit and creates problems in particular for SMEs .
<en> Therefore we cannot support them .
<sp>
<en> The Greens believe it is essential that ozone depleting substances are removed from the market immediately and an effective ban should have been put in place a long time ago .
<en> The Social and Christian Democrats in Europe seem determined to delay the ban of the dangerous ozone destroyer , methyl bromide , and we believe that any proposal to prolong the use of this toxic substance is a menace to human health and the environment .
<en> The hole in the ozone layer has increased in size by 20-25 % during the past two years alone .
<en> It is incredible that any MEP would allow or support practices which will allow this depletion to continue .
<en> Scientists agree that rapid phasing out of the production and consumption of methyl bromide is the single most effective additional step to the Montreal Protocol to stop the depletion of the ozone layer .
<en> Methyl bromide is a highly toxic pesticide gas used in agriculture .
<en> It kills all kinds of soil organisms , good and bad alike .
<en> Europe is the second biggest user of methyl bromide in the world , 90 % of which is used in agriculture , mainly in Italy and Spain .
<en> These countries are exerting strong pressure to permit the continued use of this poison for a longer transition period .
<en> It is irresponsible that , for the sake of the vested interests of a few shortsighted farmers in Italy and Spain , the whole world should suffer from increasing UV-radiation with its devastating consequences such as an increased incidence of skin cancer and other irreversible damages to the environment .
<en> The fact that Ms Graenitz and Mr Poggioloni propose to phase out this substance by 2005 is just not good enough .
<en> This is four years later than even the EU Commission itself proposes .
<en> Germany and the Netherlands have already successfully phased out the use of methyl bromide and Denmark , Sweden and Finland will do so by 2001 .
<en> The Greens want the deadline as proposed by the Commission to be reinstated .
<en> The other disturbing factor is that there appears to be a policy of double standards .
<en> The ozone-depleting hydrochlorofluorocarbons will be outlawed for use in the EU , but companies in the EU will be allowed to continue to export exactly the same chemicals for use outside the EU .
<en> This is not acceptable and runs counter to protection of the global environment .

<en> Madam President , the Commission is pleased to have the opportunity to give its opinion on this own-initiative report by the Committee on Fisheries , and I should like to begin by congratulating the Committee on Fisheries , and particularly Mrs Hardstaff , on drawing up this report .
<en> On the whole , the Commission supports the majority of conclusions and recommendations included in the motion for a resolution , and it is pleased to note that the report underlines the vital importance of increased selectivity of fishing gear .
<en> The report also includes a reference to implementing a ban on discards .
<en> As the members of the Committee on Fisheries are already aware , the Commission does not fully support the idea of a global ban on discards for a number of reasons .
<en> However , the new regulation on technical conservation measures , which will enter into force on 1 January 2000 , includes a significant number of provisions that could lead to increased selectivity of fishing gear and , as a result , may reduce the need to discard catches .
<en> The Commission notes the suggestion included in the report on investigating the value of banning discards for one or two species as a pilot project .
<en> Once again , Madam President , the Commission should like to thank Parliament for having drawn up this report .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would just like finally to say that we have had a very exhausting week and that a really important point has been made .
<2en> We have received confirmation from a representative of the Council that the Council will now look after security in Brussels .
<sp>
<en> That is an important piece of news .
<en> Thank you , Mr Rübig .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote on the report by Mrs Hardstaff will take place on 28 January 1999 in Brussels .
