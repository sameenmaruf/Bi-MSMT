<en> EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Redondo Jiménez report ( A5-0152 / 2000 )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I voted for the Redondo report which regulates European Union interventions in the event of fires and atmospheric pollution .
<2en> This is certainly a positive measure .
<2en> I voted for the motion but I would prefer it if , in future , in implementing the proposal , we took into consideration the fact that many pensioners and elderly people live near forests and they are often the only people left in remote and countryside areas .
<2en> Fires are frequent in these areas and it would therefore be a good idea , or rather appropriate to use these people to help prevent fires .
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) This report contains amendments to the current regulations on the protection of Community forests against atmospheric pollution and forest fires .
<2en> The amendments to the regulation on protecting forests against fires are particularly important for Portugal .
<2en> In fact , we must pay considerably greater attention to the Mediterranean woodlands that have been affected by forest fires , and this requires considerable financial resources for reforestation and for the necessary fire prevention measures .
<2en> For Portugal , where fires have destroyed large areas of forest , it is vital to increase appropriations in order to supplement national investment in building infrastructure , for example , and to help local authorities , private landowners ' associations or wasteland management bodies to buy fire prevention equipment .
<2en> This is why the increase to EUR 77 million in Community appropriations proposed by the rapporteur as opposed to the EUR 50 million proposed by the Commission is so important .
<2en> It is also important to create a Community information system on forest fires so that the situation at any given time is more widely known .
<2en> This will enable us to fight more effectively against forest fires and their causes .

<en> Mr President , this proposal for an action programme in public health is greatly welcomed by this Parliament .
<en> Health is an issue which opinion poll after opinion poll shows is the number one priority for our citizens across the European Union .
<en> This issue matters to ordinary people : people understand when you talk about health .
<en> As we discuss this report this evening we should never forget this .
<en> We often talk about getting closer to citizens and , with an appalling turnout across the Union at the last European elections , we should never forget what is important to our citizens .
<en> As we all know , Article 152 gives public health greater importance than ever before , so that health has to be taken into consideration in all European Union policy areas .
<en> With this programme we can directly add value to the lives of European Union citizens .
<en> By taking a horizontal approach to public health , we can make the best use of limited resources .
<en> With a rapid reaction unit to tackle communicable disease we can act much more effectively .
<en> With health impact assessments we can detect what works and what does not .
<en> With more health information for our citizens , quality of life will surely improve .
<en> Although I support much of what the rapporteur proposes , I still have concern over the issue of the centre .
<en> I fear that this issue could delay the whole programme because of the legal questions surrounding the proposal .
<en> In addition , I also fear that such a centre would take away much of the budget , leaving very little for the work which actually connects effectively with our citizens .
<en> In conclusion , health connects with the citizen .
<en> We must guarantee that this proposal , which will last for the next five years , is effective .
<en> We must deliver on health and well-being .
<en> After all , colleagues , the European elections are not far away .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I am very grateful to the rapporteur , Professor Trakatellis , and to the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and other committees involved for all their work on this important and ambitious programme which is a crucial element in the Community 's overall health strategy .
<en> This programme represents a fundamental step forward in the development of effective European public health policies .
<en> It is important because protecting and improving public health is at the very centre of our citizens , concerns and expectations .
<en> As we are all aware , the relevance of our public health policy is fast becoming a litmus test of the European Union 's credibility for our citizens .
<en> The programme will address these preoccupations by providing the means , support and actions in those areas where the Community can make a real difference as foreseen in Article 152 as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty .
<en> The programme under consideration today responds comprehensively to the shared concerns which the Commission , Parliament and the Council have expressed in the past about the shortcomings of the previous programming approach .
<en> Consequently , we are moving away from the fragmented disease-oriented , project-driven measures of the past , where resources were spread thinly , the impact on public health was diminished and financial management requirements were multiplied .
<en> In its place , we are moving to improve the health policy focus and streamlining programme management , which will minimise bureaucracy , improve coordination , increase transparency and maximise impact .
<en> The architecture of the new programme will also ensure a degree of flexibility , so that we can respond to unforeseen health policy issues if and when they arise .
<en> It provides a horizontal framework which will allow a policy-driven approach to be taken in the future on the basis of a broad view of public health .
<en> In other words the programme will provide an invaluable support to health policy-making in the Community .
<en> The programme identifies three strands of action that together will enable us to identify and tackle the major health problems that we face .
<en> First , improving knowledge about people 's health , about health interventions and about the functioning of health systems .
<en> Second , anticipating and reacting quickly to major threats to health .
<en> Third , confronting the key underlying causes of ill-health related not only to personal lifestyles , but also to other key determinants : social , economic and environmental factors and so on .
<en> I am pleased to see that very many of the amendments you are debating are in line with this broad view of public health and the way that we should address it at Community level .
<en> We can therefore accept , in full , 61 amendments .
<en> There are in addition a further 24 amendments which include valuable ideas that we can endorse , but which as drafted are not fully acceptable .
<en> This is either because they contain specific points of substance which conflict with the approach of the programme , or because they raise difficult issues .
<en> With so many amendments , it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them .
<en> I will , therefore , concentrate on four key areas where there are several amendments which we cannot accept and where I believe that some clarification of the Commission 's position will be particularly helpful .
<en> First , the scope and structure of the programme .
<en> Even though most amendments respect and indeed reinforce the horizontal or policy-driven approach of the programme , several , such as Amendments Nos 12 , 65 , 66 , 85 , 91 , 100 , 111 , 112 and 113 , go against this approach .
<en> They introduce into the decision references either to specific diseases and conditions or to very precise actions to be taken .
<en> Providing some illustrations of major health burdens and activities in a recital may prove to be helpful , but the greatest caution is needed to ensure that the programme does not become so overcrowded with priorities and actions that it loses not only its general orientation , but also the flexibility necessary to respond effectively to new developments and threats as they arise .
<en> Events in recent years have clearly demonstrated the need to retain such flexibility .
<en> Consequently , it is important to focus on key priorities where real added value can be produced .
<en> Activities duplicating the work of other Community programmes should be avoided , and this will also avoid the unnecessary use of scarce resources .
<en> For this reason Amendments Nos 86 , 88 , 89 , 92 , 94 and 110 are not acceptable .
<en> They all touch on subjects such as setting up programmes in eastern Europe , violence against women , risks from mobile telephones , complementary therapies and research , which are covered by other Community programmes .
<en> Efforts have been made by Parliament not to infringe the principle of subsidiarity , that is to say , the responsibilities of Member States in the area of public health .
<en> The programme has a clear role in relation to information about how health systems are working , but this should not be interpreted as the Community having a role in the operation of specific health services .
<en> These are matters for the Member States .
<en> For this reason , Amendments Nos 79 , 99 and 102 in relation to protecting the rights of patients and setting up centres of excellence on environmental toxicology and on gene therapy and cloning are not acceptable ; and whilst I agreed that the right of patients to simple , clear and scientifically valid information concerning their illness , is in itself a valuable objective , regrettably , the Community has limited competences under Article 152 of the EC Treaty .
<en> Turning now to another issue in connection with the basic structure and scope of the programme .
<en> Amendment No 106 , on the table today , sets out some actions intended to develop links between the programme and other policies .
<en> The ideas it contains , for example on health impact assessment , are welcome , but for me this work should not be approached separately from the other actions in the programme .
<en> In fact , health in other policies is a fundamental feature of the entire health strategy as such .
<en> Activities related to health impact assessment should thus be firmly placed within the proposed structure of the programme and not added as a further separate strand of action .
<en> To be consistent , the mainstreaming of health in other policies should form part of the mainstream of our three programme strands .
<en> Therefore , this amendment is acceptable only in part .
<en> Secondly , on implementation , the precondition for the delivery of all these objectives is implementation capacity .
<en> Let me say at the outset that I fully accept that the Commission does not currently possess the technical capacity to meet the challenge of implementation .
<en> There is no doubt that we will have to make significant efforts to put in place coordination , monitoring and implementation of capacity which is adequate to the technical challenge offered by this programme .
<en> Without any doubt the issue is a priority for the three institutions in this process .
<en> The success of the programme will depend very much on our ability to bring together the necessary resources and expertise at Community level , within Member States and in international organisations .
<en> The Commission will do everything it can to ensure the smooth running of the programme by creating the effective coordination and monitoring capability which is essential to make the programme a success .
<en> I am currently investigating various options for ensuring this capability , for example , ways to strengthen internal capacities or the new possibility offered by the externalisation initiative to establish one or more specialised bodies for different implementation tasks .
<en> However , the amendments include a substantial number of references to the creation of a health coordination and monitoring centre in the programme decision .
<en> Let me be very clear about our position on this .
<en> As I have said , I wholeheartedly agree with the need for an identifiable mechanism to ensure effective coordination and monitoring to make the programme a success .
<en> I also agree that this must be under the auspices of the Commission .
<en> But the proposal of Parliament to set up a centre within the Commission , which is named in a number of amendments to the programme decision , raises a number of serious legal and institutional difficulties .
<en> In particular , it infringes on the Commission 's right to determine its own organisation .
<en> Therefore I cannot accept Amendments Nos 11 and 49 , nor can I accept those parts of other amendments which contain a reference to a " health coordination and monitoring centre " .
<en> To summarise our position , I believe we are largely in agreement on what needs to be done but we need to reflect carefully on how we achieve this , given the legal , institutional and budgetary implications .
<en> In keeping with this agreed objective let me confirm my commitment to work actively with Parliament and the Council in the weeks ahead to find agreed solutions so that adequate structures , expertise and resources will be available for the proper implementation of the programme .
<en> That brings me to the third point - the budget .
<en> The Commission 's proposal is for a total budget of EUR 300 million over a period of six years .
<en> There are two amendments on the table today to increase this amount respectively to EUR 500 million - Amendment No 72 - and EUR 380 million - Amendment No 109 .
<en> The decision on this is for the Council and the European Parliament , as the budgetary authority .
<en> At this stage I would simply say that the Commission is keeping to its original proposal .
<en> This was drawn up on the basis of a cost estimate for the actions included in the programme , and is in conformity with the financial perspectives .
<en> It is clear that any proposals to add to the actions foreseen will have budgetary implications .
<en> I cannot , therefore , accept Amendments Nos 37 , 72 and 109 on the total budget for the programme .
<en> In addition , Amendments Nos 72 , 103 and 109 seek to set limits on how we spend the programme budget .
<en> Amendments Nos 72 and 109 stipulate that each strand of actions must receive at least 25 % of the budget .
<en> Amendment No 103 proposes a restriction on the use to be made of calls for tender and , in addition , raises the ceilings for the percentage of a project 's costs that can be covered by a subvention .
<en> Such restrictions undermine the essential principle that the programme must be flexible and able to respond to new challenges , emerging risks and public concerns over the coming six years .
<en> Therefore I cannot accept either a minimum amount for expenditure on each strand or the limit on the use of calls for tender .
<en> I am , however , prepared to raise the limit on subventions to the 70 % permissible under the Commission 's established financial rules , but I cannot go beyond this .
<en> Finally , on comitology , a number of amendments concern the type of committee to be established .
<en> We had originally proposed an advisory committee as this would minimise the bureaucracy and procedural work required .
<en> Amendments Nos 42 and 73 call for a mixed committee combining management and advisory procedures .
<en> From our existing public health programmes we have experience of working with a mixed committee .
<en> Furthermore this is in line with the Council Decision 1999 / 468 .
<en> Therefore the Commission can accept these amendments .
<en> However , Amendment No 74 specifies a large number of tasks for the committee to perform in management mode .
<en> The sheer number of tasks would be counterproductive with regard to our flexibility , in implementing the programme and the proper functioning of the committee .
<en> For this reason I cannot agree to some of the provisions in this amendment , for example on the annual budget and arrangements and procedures for selecting and financing projects as according to Article 234 of the EC Treaty the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the budget .
<en> Therefore I can only accept it in part .
<en> Furthermore , the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 105 concerning the submission of annual work programmes to Parliament for opinion .
<en> I can , however , accept to submit them for information , as is set out in Amendment No 46 .
<en> In summary , for the reasons I have set out , 28 amendments are not acceptable .
<en> These are : Amendments Nos 33 , 36 , 37 , 41 , 62 , 65 , 66 , 71 , 72 , 83 , 85 , 86 , 88 , 89 , 91 , 92 , 94 , 97 , 99 , 100 , 102 , 104 , 105 , 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 and 113 .
<en> I accept only in part Amendments Nos 6 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 27 , 29 , 32 , 44 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 54 , 57 , 63 , 70 , 74 , 76 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 93 , 103 and 106 .
<en> On the other hand , as I have indicated I can accept in full the remaining 61 amendments .
<en> I repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in .
<en> Many of the amendments will improve this proposal .
<en> For those points where difficulties remain the Commission is ready and willing to assist in finding solutions quickly .
<en> I am confident that we can work together to resolve the outstanding issues in the course of the codecision process .
<en> Indeed , the fact that the Commission can accept in whole or in part 85 of the 113 amendments shows our willingness to take on board Parliament 's substantial policy contributions and our confidence that together we will be able to get this important programme off the ground as quickly as possible .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Commissioner Byrne .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply .
<2en> I do not share your optimism about progress because , as we can see in Greece and Italy - and I refer here to Greece in particular because it is my own country - there has been no progress .
<2en> Twenty-five percent of unregistered workers alone are foreigners , in which case there is hardly any justification for the mass influx of unskilled foreign workers into Greece .
<2en> Do you really believe , with this situation , that the ambitious targets set by the European Commission can be achieved , or should you be calling for means over and above political commitment , the means which countries need to have if they are to make progress ?
<2en> Because undeclared work impacts not just on pension schemes , it also impacts on free competition and , of course , protection for workers , because we are hardly talking high-powered jobs here .
<2en> I ask you in all honesty , do you feel that the means which you have at your disposal right now are sufficient to stamp out this phenomenon and its many and varied implications ?
<sp>
<2en> I must stress , Mr President , that the Commission is not a superstate and it cannot judge policies which are purely national policies and for which each Member State takes the specific measures which it feels it needs to take .
<2en> What takes place at European level on this particular issue is collaboration between the Member States , through the guidelines , in which undeclared work is a priority and , naturally , steps have also been taken in countries such as Italy which have serious problems .
<2en> Steps have been taken within an institutional framework to increase incentives to register workers and integrate immigrants .
<2en> My evaluation of the measures taken by the Greek government , which is why I was cautious , is that its reaction bodes well in that it has introduced a series of institutional measures which are now under way , such as integrating immigrants and paying companies incentives for low-paid workers and , once they have been implemented , these institutional reforms should bring in positive results .
<2en> As you know , the measures taken by government are evaluated every year and the guidelines contain the Commission 's input .
<sp>
<2en> As you know , Commissioner , where there is undeclared work there are usually undeclared businesses .
<2en> So I think we should be discussing not how many people have not been registered with social security agencies but how many businesses have not been registered at all , either with the Ministry of Trade or the police .
<2en> Nowhere .
<2en> There are sectors in Greece in which this is the rule rather than the exception .
<2en> And their economic raison d 'être is that no one knows about them .
<2en> Of course , the Commission does not interfere in internal affairs in the Member States and rightly so .
<2en> But I do still wonder if companies in general can get away without registering from the point of view of Community legislation ?
<2en> Is there nothing the Commission can do about this during the course of its duties ?
<sp>
<2en> As you said , this is a matter in which it is very difficult for the European Commission to intervene .
<2en> The registration of companies , which is the top priority for a country as far as its tax system , that is , its revenue is concerned , and as far as its social security system , that is , pensions are concerned , is obviously a priority for the Member States and I do not think that any recommendations are needed along these lines .
<2en> I can only hope , from the information at our disposal , that the computerisation of the Social Security Institution , the law on regional companies and certain reforms along these lines will bring in results .

<en> Question No 47 by ( H-0015 / 02 ) :
<en> Subject : Transfer of unemployment entitlements Under the provisions of Regulation ( EEC ) 1408 / 71 , employees who are nationals of EU Member States may acquire unemployment benefit entitlements in any Member State .
<en> Immigrant workers , from non-Community countries , who wish to receive unemployment benefits in an EU Member State other than their country of residence are not entitled to do so under the terms of the Regulation , which does not allow them to transfer their entitlements .
<en> How can you justify the fact that employees from non-EEC countries are not entitled to unemployment benefits if they change their country of residence despite having paid contributions like other employees ?
<en> Why are they not allowed to make use of forms E301 and E303 to transfer unemployment entitlements ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to endorse the thanks expressed by my colleague , Commissioner Bolkestein , to the European Parliament and especially the draftsman , Mr Berenguer Fuster , for their cooperation and efficient handling of this file .
<en> As you know , the Commission supports the Council common position because it is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission proposal .
<en> It also takes account of the most important amendments at first reading .
<en> The Commission would like to confirm that it accepts Amendments Nos 1 , 3 to 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 and 16 .
<en> With regard to Amendment No 17 , the Commission can accept it , although it considers that a minor redrafting is needed to avoid any legal misinterpretation .
<en> The Commission cannot , however , accept Amendments Nos 2 , 9 , 13 , 14 and 18 , for the following reasons : Amendment No 2 excludes from the proposal a large number of insurance intermediaries , which minimises the scope of the directive .
<en> It cannot therefore be accepted .
<en> Amendment No 9 introduces transitional provisions to safeguard the acquired rights of existing insurance intermediaries .
<en> The Commission has already accepted Amendment No 15 , which expresses the same objective in better terms and , in addition , meets all the concerns of the directive .
<en> The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13 , which introduces the principle of best possible advice .
<en> It creates great legal uncertainty and would in practice be a source of legal conflict .
<en> Amendment No 16 , which the Commission accepts , goes in the same direction as the common position and improves it .
<en> Amendments Nos 14 and 18 put in jeopardy the key objective of high consumer protection , something that the Commission cannot accept .
<en> Indeed , if they were accepted they would deprive the customer of the basic information requirements .
<en> Amendment No 18 in particular would leave the customer in a position of uncertainty , as he would not be provided with the written advice on the appropriate insurer 's product recommended by the intermediary .
<en> The objective of achieving a true single market with a high level of consumer protection would not be achieved .
<en> The Commission strongly opposes this amendment .
<en> I thank you for your rather limited attention .
<en> ( Laughter , applause )
<sp>
<en> I apologise for the noise .
<en> Regarding Amendment No 17 :
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in accordance with the Commission 's comments , I would like to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 17 saying the same thing , but in a different place .
<2en> So instead of being at the end of the recital , the paragraph proposed in Amendment No 17 would be after ' other professional activity ? , so that the amendment would read : ' This Directive should not be applied to persons who conduct another professional activity , for example , a tax expert or accountant who advises on insurance incidentally as part of that other professional activity " , and here the paragraph proposed in the Amendment would be included , " or to those simply providing general information on insurance products ? .
<2en> The rest of the recital would remain as it was drawn up in the common position .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I want to point out again that there is an error in the French translation of Amendment No 4 in which the phrase , " both safe and acceptable " has been translated as " both healthy and acceptable " .

<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) We have before us a draft directive which is intended to establish the principle of a system of initial qualification and of compulsory periodic training for drivers in all Member States , distinct from the training required in order to obtain a driving licence .
<2en> This is an issue which has a great impact on most Member States , both current and future , given that this training is currently only compulsory in France and the Netherlands .
<2en> Having studied the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism 's proposal , which we are now discussing , it is clear that this has taken account of the Council 's observations on the Member States ' having a choice with regard to complying with the basic training requirements , viz. the introduction of course attendance followed by an examination , or of an examination only .
<2en> This will be followed by an initial period of eight years , after which , the Commission will undertake an evaluation of the equivalence of the various systems and of their efficiency with regard to the level of qualification required .
<2en> It is extremely important that the entry into force of this directive should not be retroactive and , consequently , that no provision derived from this act can be applied to drivers already working in the profession .
<2en> On the other hand , we fully understand that this directive should apply to all drivers entering the profession at least four years after its entry into force .
<2en> These aspects have been crucial in ...

<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) The adoption of any measure intended to improve road traffic safety is greatly to be welcomed .
<2en> These measures , incidentally , present an urgent challenge - road accidents are the greatest cause of loss of human life in Europe .
<2en> I therefore believe that the compulsory periodic training of drivers of heavy goods vehicles in all Member States is entirely appropriate .
<2en> With regard to goods transport , I have been calling for a long time for priority to be given to re-establishing rail transport and to revitalising short-sea maritime transport ( or cabotage ) and inland waterways , instead of focusing attention on the more than overloaded road system .
<2en> For this reason , and in addition to the proposal before us , I support all the measures to encourage this re-balance between means of transport and a better use of transport networks at European level .
<sp>
<2en> This is a report by Mrs De Sarnez on Erasmus World .
<2en> The phrase ' Erasmus World ' reminds me of Fantasy World , Adventure World and Future World , in other words of Disney World .
<2en> This is a programme for young people , but when will we have a Methuselah World programme - EUR 200 million appropriated not just for culture and cooperation through aid to young people but also for exchanges of culture between the elderly , who travel throughout the world in such large numbers ?
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) The European Union must meet the needs of a society that is based on knowledge and open to the world .
<2en> The Erasmus World programme will enable us to respond to these challenges by stimulating the quality of higher education and by promoting cultural exchanges in cooperation with third countries .
<2en> Hence the importance of this report , which I support .
<2en> European higher education must be acknowledged to be of high quality and in line with the needs of the labour market .
<2en> The success of this programme will only be assured by a budget increase that will provide the various projects with appropriate funding , and also by the rigorous selection of the candidates , establishments and teaching staff .
<2en> Scholarships that are awarded must enable all categories of candidates to participate in these exchanges .
<2en> It is particularly important to publicise this programme through communication and information projects and by drafting common working instruments that do not constitute barriers to the movement of candidates .
<2en> Lastly , the name ' Erasmus Mundus ' is particularly felicitous , because it gives the programme a more global dimension without favouring the language of any Member State .
<sp>
<2en> - ( FR ) We voted for this text and the majority of the amendments insofar as they can encourage improvements in higher education in Europe and further greater openness in higher education to other cultures and languages for students in both the European Union and third countries .
<2en> Of course , however , we rejected the amendments which sought , openly or indirectly , to further private higher education institutions or allow employers , whatever the pretext might be , to increase their hold over university education .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) I voted against the Cunha report , which broadly approves the Fischler proposal , which , disguised as a midway review of Agenda 2000 , proposes a radical reform of the CAP based on decoupling and modulation of aid and on eco-conditionality .
<2en> I cannot support this reform , which clearly aims to further liberalise agricultural policy , continue to lower the prices of agricultural products and to dissociate farmers ' income from what they produce , in order to anticipate the possible requirements of the WTO .
<2en> In short , it is organising the destruction of European agriculture and first of all of French agriculture in the name of misguided globalism .
<2en> While it should have been aiming for a more stable CAP , increasing the responsibility of those involved , based on profitable prices , this text is going to take agriculture further along the road towards greater concentration , along with a form of State control of an agriculture sector that is condemned either to over productivity , or to becoming simply paid gardening .
<sp>
<2en> I have a great deal of understanding and admiration for the tremendous amount of work that all our rapporteurs have done under Mr Daul 's excellent presidency .
<2en> I know how difficult it was to obtain majorities for these reports .
<2en> I regret therefore that I cannot give Mr Cunha 's report my unconditional support , because the proposed solution of partial decoupling would place a considerable burden on the existence of multifunctional agriculture in the less-favoured region of Luxembourg , with very familiar economic , social and environmental consequences .
<2en> This is a responsibility that I cannot and do not wish to assume .
<2en> Problems with the transfer of payment entitlements will arise whether decoupling is full or partial .
<2en> I fear that the proposal which concerns transfer of payment entitlements with leased land will lead to big problems of a financial and legal nature , as well as to unpredictable speculation at the expense of active farms .
<2en> The fundamental problems with modulation also remain , even if the percentages of reduction are set at a low level .
<2en> Reducing aid through modulation leads to an unreasonable drop in agricultural income .
<2en> For our farmers , the figure of EUR 7 500 is too low .
<2en> That is why I have tabled an amendment to raise this to EUR 10 000 .
<2en> Otherwise , practically all of Luxembourg 's farmers would suffer losses in income of up to 20 % , which would be catastrophic .
<2en> ( Statement of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<2en> ( NL ) Since industrialisation , food prices have been kept artificially low , which has also enabled industrial wages to remain low .
<2en> Since then , farmers have been forced to produce more and more for ever decreasing rewards .
<2en> The EU subsidy system was a means of achieving greater economies of scale and increasing production per hectare .
<2en> Revenues from taxes go some way towards compensating farmers for their lack of income .
<2en> The survival of small-scale farmers and villages in southern Europe has become highly dependent on this subsidy policy .
<2en> They therefore regard the current common agricultural policy as the best the EU can offer , even if they would like to see funds allocated more fairly .
<2en> They regard every change as a brutal , neoliberal attack .
<2en> They are afraid that a new system will only serve as a subsidy on land ownership and land speculation and will not be able to stop the depopulation of the countryside .
<2en> In northern Europe , on the other hand , most of the small farmers have already been ' cleared away ' , and public opinion regards the agricultural funds as a kind of bureaucracy , a waste of money and environmental pollution which must be brought to an end as soon as possible .
<2en> I did and do agree with the demand to switch from production subsidies to income guarantees and the protection of the landscape .
<2en> The current proposal , however , seems to be primarily aimed at winning over the Americans in the WTO with a view to exporting other EU products .

<en> The vast majority of reports we have just voted upon I can support and agree with .
<en> Jeggle and Souchet often cause me little problems but Mr Cunha 's report is different .
<en> The current CAP , which has been reformed on many different occasions down the years , has become top-heavy with red tape and bureaucracy , and I rather feel that what we are proposing is to heap more misery on top of what already exists .
<en> What do we have now ?
<en> De-coupling , modulation , degressivity and cross-compliance in place of good farming practice and an honest return for honest endeavours .
<en> I sincerely believe that partial de-coupling will prove to be the worst of all worlds and provide no encouragement for the industry in the future , or do anything to streamline the industry or encourage young people to make a career in agriculture .
<en> This will immediately mean more controls and inspections and less time for the farmer to tend his stock .
<en> I will vote against to ensure that in the longer term the Northern Ireland agriculture industry is not destroyed in the name of efficiency .
<sp>
<en> The British Conservatives voted against the Commission proposal as amended , but in favour of the legislative resolution .
<en> We did this , not because we support the contents of Parliament 's report , but because it is imperative that Parliament gives an opinion so that Council may proceed to a decision .
<en> Europe 's farmers must be given a clear direction for the future .
<en> We support Commissioners Fischler 's proposals to reform the CAP and believe it is long overdue .
<en> We are completely behind the plans to decouple payments away from production , and welcome the freeing up of agriculture .
<en> We also believe that the Fischler proposals will ensure the future of European agriculture in an enlarged Europe of 25 Member States .
<en> The proposals as they are in Parliament 's text would only confuse and complicate an already over-bureaucratic system , and force agriculture into even further decline .
<en> The Commission reforms will put us in a strong position when we sit around the table at the WTO talks in Cancun .
<en> We hope that Commissioner Fischler sticks to his guns , and pushes ahead with his plans in Luxembourg next week .
<en> We , and European farmers , wish him every success !

<en> Question No 54 by Ari Vatanen ( H-0470 / 03 ) :
<en> Subject : NATURA 2000 site designation
<en> The rules of Article 4 of the Habitat Directive 92 / 43 / EEC
<sp>
<en> The Commission has , on several occasions , looked into the correct transposition of the habitats directive and the birds directive into Finnish legislation .
<en> At present the Commission is of the opinion that the Articles referring to the procedure of establishing the Natura 2000 network have been correctly transposed .
<en> As the Natura 2000 network has caused a considerable amount of controversy in Finland , the Commission has looked into the national procedure for site selection and has in past years notified Finland of some shortcomings , both in the number of sites to be protected and the quality of the data .
<en> Finland has endeavoured to address these shortcomings .
<en> The present quality of the data is acceptable to the Commission .
<en> The complaints from Finland seem to contain some misinterpretations of the evaluation principles .
<en> The Commission bases its evaluations on the latest submitted data , not on the oldest information .
<en> The Commission is aware that some landowners in Finland have been dissatisfied with the Natura 2000 proposals .
<en> The Commission has been informed that all landowners have had the possibility to see the proposals and to lodge complaints against them before Finland officially submitted the proposals to the Commission .
<en> The Finnish courts have examined the complaints on a case-by-case basis , considering each time the validity of the data .
<en> The majority of the complaints have been rejected by the courts .
<en> The directive does not establish any requirements for consultation at the national level and thus , in respect of the principle of subsidiarity , it has been for individual Member States to exercise their responsibilities , taking account of national laws and procedures .
<en> The Commission 's concerns are therefore limited to respect the scientific selection criteria as set out in the directive .
<en> Although the Commission can understand that in these cases the dissatisfaction might persist , it cannot conclude that the Finnish authorities have arbitrarily misinterpreted the rules or proceeded in a way that has been contradictory to those rules .
<sp>
<en> Commissioner , I appreciate your answer and your effort generally regarding the environment in Europe , but what you say is simply not coherent with everyday facts .
<en> When this was implemented in Finland it was mainly based on old protection schemes , which do not meet directive criteria for Natura 2000 sites .
<en> Therefore , you must understand the position of the private landowners .
<en> Their right to use their own land was wrongly prohibited and in fact , contrary to what you say , the appeals in the Finnish courts were handled en bloc .
<en> 99 times out of 100 they were rejected outright .
<en> People therefore feel frustrated and powerless .
<en> We believe in Europe , but how do we convince ordinary European citizens or the Finnish farmer if they feel they have been steamrollered by Europe and , in this case , by the Finnish authorities ?
<en> They have simply been the victims of injustice .
<sp>
<en> The honourable Member has raised a very valid question .
<en> How do we communicate Natura 2000 and the creation of this important network , when the original motives have been lost in the debate in the years that followed the introduction of this directive ?
<en> I hope that we will also be better able to assist Member States in giving good examples of how to communicate the directive , but I am not convinced that we will ever be able to solve this problem of the Finnish Government and authorities having to introduce a consultation process with , for example , Finnish landowners .
<en> We will never be able to solve that from Brussels , but hopefully we can do better in giving good examples of how this consultation process can be implemented and carried out in different countries .
<en> It is important that we also make clear where the responsibility lies with the Commission and where there is a case for subsidiarity and we will thus have to rely on a Member State - in this case the Finnish Government and authorities - to also organise work on this .
<en> From a formal point of view , we have not found any wrongdoings in the Finnish having , for example , arbitrarily carried out this work .
<en> We cannot find any such formal mispractice at all .
<sp>
<en> As the time allocated to Question Time to the Commission is at an end , Questions Nos 55 to 85 will be answered in writing
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) This proposal for a regulation consolidates a long-established practice which , according to the specialists , works extremely well .
<2en> In fact , the Economic Accounts for Agriculture ( EAA ) form an essential instrument for monitoring and assessing the CAP .
<2en> As we all know , these have traditionally been compiled by the Member States on the basis of a common methodology and supplied to the Commission ( Eurostat ) under a gentlemen 's agreement .
<2en> I therefore agree with the Commission 's vision of upholding and improving the quality of data and of establishing a framework for data transmission , which will provide economic actors with greater transparency and better access to information .
<2en> I believe that , in this area , as in many other spheres of Community action , the coordinated compilation of data and the sharing of such data as well as comparisons and exchanges of experience constitute an enormous advantage for the efficiency and economy of action , both of the European Union and of the Member States .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for Mr Koukiadis ' report , Mr President , because what it asks and calls for is one of my long-standing dreams , when I manage to dream - which is not very often nowadays , given the approach of 13 June - for I sleep well .
<2en> Why is that ?
<2en> Because I would genuinely like European law to be genuinely a primary source of law .
<2en> It appears , for example , that Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam is being breached in Italy .
<2en> There is discrimination against elderly people and people with disabilities , who are given - or not given - financial support just because they are over , or under , 65 years old .
<2en> I therefore welcome this report and I look forward to when European law is made a primary source of law .
<sp>
<2en> ( EL ) Behind the ostensibly neutral title ' on legal bases and compliance with Community law ' , the own-initiative report by the Committee on Legal Affairs hides the complete subjugation of national law to Community law .
<2en> Fully aligned with the philosophy of the ? U , the report maintains that the Community should have the facility to force the Member States to impose specific criminal sanctions in the event of infringements of Community law .
<2en> The term ' criminal sanctions ' carries a great deal of weight , which distinguishes it from the administrative or financial sanctions which the rulers of the ? U already impose .
<2en> The report also proposes that the Commission should be able to appear in national criminal courts in order to bring civil actions and even to force the Member States to impose prison sentences decided by the Community .
<2en> All we need now are Community gaols to carry out Community sentences !
<2en> This is yet another infringement of national sovereignty and the so-called ' rule of law ' of the bourgeoisie , in that a supranational body is being instructed to exercise criminal jurisdiction and to decide on the type and level of sanctions .
<2en> Of course , the anxious search for legal bases hides the ambition to serve the interests of the unifying monopolies in all sectors and the sweeping away of democratic achievements .
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) The report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market takes as its starting point the principle that its proposals are not intended to ' lay down criminal-law rules or achieve criminal-law harmonisation ' .
<2en> This - which we believe to be the right place to start - is the fruit of preparatory work and serious reflection by the Committee on Legal Affairs , which has placed especial reliance on hearings of experts in the criminal law , who confirmed that such harmonisation would give rise to upheavals and major problems .
<2en> Unfortunately , the rest of the report takes us in precisely the opposite direction by relying on the extensive interpretations of the Court of Justice , by calling on the Commission , in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties , to lodge complaints and by asking the Intergovernmental Conference to define Community competence in criminal law .
<2en> The Members belonging to the ' Hunting , Fishing , Nature and Tradition ' delegation within the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities have therefore voted against this report , which , using a technique familiar to us in this area , ends up requiring us to do what we have said we do not want to do .
<sp>
<en> As is explained in the report , there are a few instances in which criminal sanctions are imposed via Community law .
<en> They are the exception rather than the rule , and it is most important that the Community , in responding to paragraph 10 of the report , does not acquire any general competence in criminal matters which should be left to the Member States .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , if referring to the nature of the rules whereby our Assembly arranges to hear Heads of State speak is not a procedural motion , then I do not know what is .
<2en> In any case , I shall be brief .
<2en> I think that , of the foreign Heads of State received by our Parliament , many – beginning with Mr Bouteflika – have not , to say the least , been the representatives of completely democratic regimes …
<sp>
<2en> – Mr Gollnisch , I had warned you .
<2en> I do not see to which rule of procedure you are referring .
<2en> This is not a procedural motion ; it is a political remark , and you do not have the floor .
<sp>
<2en> Updating and harmonising social security systems are crucial issues for the Member States and hence the need to support initiatives that will help them to achieve these aims .
<2en> The Social Protection Committee , which is intended to promote cooperation on social security policies between the Member States , the candidate countries and the Commission is one such initiative and therefore won my vote .
<2en> The committee must monitor the social security situation in the Member States and changes in this situation .
<2en> It must present reports , specifically on situations of poverty and social inclusion – deliver opinions , establish contacts and cooperate with the relevant bodies in this field .
<2en> I would stress that greater priority must be given to Parliament ’ s role .
<2en> The committee should inform Parliament in an efficient way so that Parliament can follow up this issue and Parliament ’ s position must be taken into account in all the activities of the Social Protection Committee .
<2en> Lastly , I would emphasise that the gender balance must be respected in the composition of the Committee Delegations .
<sp>
<2en> This amendment on the Social Protection Committee , which was established by Council decision of 29 June 2000 , is of a basically procedural nature .
<2en> It was brought about by the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice , on 1 February 2003 , in particular by the new legal basis set out in Article 144 thereof , with the Commission and Parliament having taken the opportunity to make some changes to the approach they had adopted previously .
<2en> One of the proposals that the EP has adopted and which I tabled in the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs seeks to ensure that the joint report on social protection pays ‘ particular attention to poverty issues and to progress in social inclusion within the EU Member States and in the accession countries ’ .
<2en> Proposals seeking to incorporate the gender dimension horizontally into the committee ’ s duties , and to report on problems specifically affecting women were also adopted , particularly on the feminisation of poverty and the changes in family models .
<2en> I therefore believe it is important to establish indicators broken down by gender and to focus on the individual rather than on the household .
<sp>
<2en> The Treaty of Nice provides for establishing a Social Protection Committee , with consultative status , to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between Member States and between these and the Commission .
<2en> A Social Protection Committee , with a similar status and aims , was established by Council decision of 29 June 2002 , and has been operational since that date .
<2en> The purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural : to establish the committee in accordance with the new legal basis .
<2en> Nevertheless , we must welcome the fact that this council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation , of promoting the exchange of good practice and of establishing appropriate contacts with management and labour .
<2en> Equally to be welcomed is the call for an annual report to be drawn up on social protection and for this to be presented to the Council and to Parliament .
<2en> In this regard , we believe that an effective process of informing Parliament must be established to enable it regularly to monitor social protection issues , in particular those related to poverty .
<2en> For these reasons , the report won my vote .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I support the Pittella Report including Amendments 3004 [ amp ] 3005 , which restore € 12 million of the 2006 funding for PEACE 11 to the technical assistance / innovative actions budget-heading .
<2en> The Member States must ensure the budgetary flexibility required in no way endangers continued full funding of PEACE 11 , as envisaged last year when funding for that programme was guaranteed into 2006 .
<2en> The Socialist Group played a key role in securing € 108 million for Ireland 's Peace 11 programme for 2006 , and continues to pledge its full support for the programme .
<2en> John Hume , a former member of the Socialist Group was the architect of the PEACE programme and its contribution to reconciliation has been enormous .
<2en> If we are to succeed in bringing communities together from both sides of the sectarian divide continued funding for the PEACE programme is crucial
<2en> We must also support the SDLP campaign for a PEACE 111 programme by earmarking € 200 million in the 2007-2013 budget .
<2en> I hope Minister Noel Tracy takes this up urgently and all Member States ensure smooth administration of arrangements for finalising the PEACE 11 funding , and guarantee continuing funding for a PEACE 111 programme for 2007-2013 .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the scrapping of tobacco production subsidies .
<2en> I feel that tobacco production , a key component in the tobacco industry , should no longer be subsidised .
<2en> The harmful impact of tobacco use on public health ( over 500 000 deaths per year due to illnesses linked to tobacco use ) , and in turn on the economies of the Member States and the EU , leads me to conclude that the EUR 100 000-plus spent on subsidies to these producers under the CAP is morally , politically and economically indefensible .
<2en> To my mind , tobacco production and the tobacco industry should not only lose our support but should gradually , but quickly , be eliminated .
<2en> Parliament must exert pressure on the Member States and the Commission to effect such a change , through the EU budget that it adopts .
<2en> Naturally , I am sensitive to the problem of the 3 500 jobs that depend on tobacco production in Portugal .
<2en> I therefore believe that efforts to convert this industry must be redoubled , in order to guarantee jobs and the economic survival of producers in Portugal and all of the European tobacco-producing countries .
<2en> In this regard , I support all of the financial backing that can be given to them , on the part of Community or national institutions .
<2en> To persevere with the policy of European subsidies , however , represents ...
<sp>
<2en> The purpose of this explanation of vote is to condemn the hypocrisy of the majority in Parliament , which , having previously approved plans to set up a ‘ Community programme ’ with ‘ adequate resources ’ for the textiles and clothing sector , ‘ especially ’ designed to help the ‘ least favoured regions ’ , with support for ‘ research , innovation , vocational training and the SMEs ’ , has now rejected a clear proposal aimed at putting this programme into practice under the Community budget for 2006 .
<2en> In other words , the majority in Parliament is guilty of shameless inconsistency .
<2en> From our perspective , we are bitterly disappointed at the rejection of proposals which we tabled and which enjoyed the support of various Members of this House .
<2en> They were aimed at :
<2en> - creating a pilot project for action in the textiles and clothing sector with a view to the future creation of a Community programme ;
<2en> - creating recovery plans for fisheries resources , in light of the social and economic impact of the closed seasons ;
<2en> - and promoting multilingualism , not least in the ACP-EU parliamentary assemblies .
<2en> We also campaigned for the adoption of other proposals that we tabled , aimed at reforestation and forest fire prevention , the preservation of cultural heritage , and support for cooperation amongst SMEs .
<sp>
<2en> In the budget vote I voted for CAP reform , for cuts in Tobacco subsidies , for the end of the transport of lives animals over 8 hours , against cuts in the Northern Ireland peace programme and for assistance to ACP banana and sugar producers .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for Heading 3 of the Budget Vote today because I want to add no less than 200 million euros in payment appropriations to a range of budget headings for the Lisbon strategy which the Council reduced at first reading .
<2en> The main areas which would boost EU competitiveness include increases for programmes to support small and medium-sized companies , but above all for the 6th framework research programme .
<2en> The payments for education programmes are also increased , by 35 million euros for Socrates , 20 million euros for Leonardo da Vinci and 3 million euros for e-learning , which I fully support .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The implementation of the Community budget , that is , ensuring that political decisions are actually implemented , is an extremely important issue .
<2en> Unfortunately the budgetary process is increasingly less transparent and more scattered , making it difficult to ascertain the final destination of funds .
<2en> The budget savings imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact and by the major contributing countries has meant that , following adoption of the annual Community budget , many priority areas are underfunded , which has led to a policy of redistribution and cuts across the budgetary headings and countless amending budgets .
<2en> In other words , non-execution is encouraged in certain areas to finance others , regardless of the adopted budget .
<2en> There are also policies and instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact , that are factors in non-implementation .
<2en> In this regard , the Commission and the Council cannot wash their hands of their responsibilities , in view of the constant reduction in payments in respect of authorisations .
<2en> National implementation must go hand in hand with the definition of national priorities on the ground , especially when it comes to the Structural Funds .
<2en> Irrespective of the instruments that have just been proposed , we do not think that the negotiations on the new financial perspective should be contingent on the proposals being adopted .
<sp>
<2en> The motion for a resolution on which we have just voted highlights the need for new management measures to be taken for the Mediterranean .
<2en> Care must always be taken to uphold the principle that the sustainability of fishery resources must be guaranteed in order to ensure that fisheries activities are viable , that fleets can continue to operate , that jobs can be maintained and that fishing communities can be developed .
<2en> We therefore feel that the Council must adopt the management regulation on which Parliament has now given its opinion .
<2en> Given that the current situation may result in discrimination among fishermen operating in other waters , however , we believe that there must be effective decentralisation and that the main stakeholders , namely the fishermen and their representative bodies , must be involved in management decisions , given that practical measures must reflect the specific realities of each fishing area or region .
<2en> We also feel that the management regulation should be accompanied by the necessary measures to compensate for the social and economic impact caused by the regulation itself , with Community funding .
<2en> All measures must be based on scientific fisheries research .
<sp>
<2en> There are many instances where an EU of 25 states does not make sense , and one-size-fits-all does not work any more – if it ever did .
<2en> There is no reason why I as a Scottish Member of this house should have a say over the Mediterranean , and I have accordingly abstained on this vote .
<2en> The EU needs to find new ways of working to ensure legitimacy of our decisions .
<2en> Continuing the notion that everyone is equally interested in everything is untenable and discredits the EU itself .
<sp>
<2en> That concludes the explanations of vote .
<sp>
<2en> I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .

<en> As the author is not present , Question No 4 lapses .
<en> Subject : Aid for trade
<en> The Finnish and German Presidencies are to be congratulated on the priority they assigned to aid for trade .
<en> What steps will the Portuguese Presidency take to ensure that spending on trade-related assistance from the Commission , and in particular Member States , continues on the correct trajectory toward the target of € 1 billion annually by 2010 ?
<en> Indeed does the Presidency have , or will it seek , clarification of the individual countries ' financial commitment toward the € 1 billion target ?
<en> How will the Portuguese Presidency ensure that the Member States and the Commission deliver adequate assistance in those aspects of aid for trade identified by the WTO aid for trade taskforce in 2006 , such as trade-related adjustment and trade-related infrastructure , which fall outside of the definition of trade-related assistance and therefore outside of the € 2 billion target ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The Portuguese Presidency is firmly determined to continue the work successfully undertaken by the Finnish and German Presidencies and to implement the conclusions on aid for trade approved by the Council on 15 May 2007 , in particular as regards the finalisation of the EU aid for trade strategy in time for it to be included in the WTO 's next global evaluation of aid for trade due to take place in November 2007 .
<en> One of the Presidency 's objectives is actually to reach an agreement on EU aid for trade strategy at October 's General Affairs and External Relations Council , including an outline of the specific steps envisaged for attaining the EUR 2 billion agreed for trade-related assistance by 2010 , notably the EUR 1 billion from the Member States to meet the needs identified by the developing countries .
<en> The Presidency is confident that that will be achieved .
<en> The strategy also aims to make a contribution to the broader agenda of aid for trade and to the definition of the measures to be implemented .
<en> Therefore , on 5 July 2007 , the Portuguese Presidency presented a draft EU aid for trade strategy which is under discussion in the relevant Council formations .
<en> The draft strategy should be seen in the context of following up the recommendations put forward in 2006 by the WTO Aid for Trade Task Force .
<sp>
<en> I am very encouraged by the President-in-Office 's response and wish him well for the October meeting .
<en> I hope he gets a successful package .
<en> If he does , will he consider publishing towards the end of this year how much each of the individual Member States has contributed in the form of aid for trade ?
<en> We know the Commission EUR 1 billion is very transparent , and it is very obvious how it is being spent .
<en> It is not so clear where the EUR 1 billion from the Member States is supposed to come from , whether this is actually happening and who it is coming from .
<en> Would the Council consider publishing that in November or December ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I thank the honourable Member for his words of encouragement and confidence .
<en> The Presidency and the Council will take the appropriate action on this matter in line with the applicable practices , conditions and legislative provisions .
<sp>
<en> Subject : Northern dimension policy
<en> The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has stated that it will seek to promote EU cooperation with the Mediterranean countries .
<en> As the EU also has a northern dimension , how will the Council Presidency simultaneously promote the EU 's northern dimension policy and its implementation ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I am in favour of cofinancing by the European Union of the ' Ambient Assisted Living ' programme , since it would benefit not just older people but also other population groups , such as those with disabilities .
<en> It is precisely because of the major demographic change in the European population and the rising life expectancy over recent decades that we must support new information and communication technologies that would make it considerably easier for older people to cope with the everyday hurdles facing them .
<en> In regard to the general cost reduction in the health sector as a result of the use of these new technologies , I would also draw your attention to the research into ' mobile health monitoring ' systems , the use of which would reduce annual health costs by EUR 1500 million in Germany alone .
<en> Let me underline that one of the benefits of cofinancing is that it would also have a positive impact on the private sector , as it would indirectly assist small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> I strongly support the AAL Joint Programme because the use of new technologies means continued respect for the private life of older people and allows them to grow old with dignity .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I back Nina Gill 's report ' Enhancing the quality of life of older people ' .
<en> In pooling resources and coordinating research and development on a European level we are more adequately able to assess how to improve the lives of our older citizens .
<en> By setting a minimum contribution we ensure the participation of all Member States in this cause .
<en> I would like to commend the rapporteur on her report and support the recommendations contained within .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We have chosen to support the report in its entirety since , in our view , the EU must prioritise action on unhealthy tax competition in the fuel sector , in particular with a view to enabling the EU to achieve its climate objectives .
<en> The tax harmonisation proposal would also not prevent individual Member States from raising their CO2 taxes on petrol and diesel .
<en> This is a further important reason for supporting the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) This proposal for a directive seeks to narrow the price differences on fuel among the various Member States that lead to distortions in terms of competition and the environment in road transport activity .
<en> The difference in prices of gas oil used as motor fuel and unleaded petrol are indeed significant .
<en> Hence its importance for Portugal , one of the countries in which this situation is making itself felt , bearing in mind the price differences between our country and Spain : Portuguese enterprises suffer competition from Spanish enterprises because the latter benefit from lower fuel prices - fuel representing around 30 % of costs - due to lower fuel tax ( and VAT ) .
<en> Portuguese enterprises have justified the stagnation of workers ' fixed wages by this pressure on costs , with serious consequences for the labour force .
<en> The European Parliament 's proposal is more positive because it eliminates the transitional periods under Article 18 , a very important aspect in the current situation , in the hope that it will make it possible to reduce the difference between Portugal and Spain in 2010 , since the latter will have to increase its fuel tax from EUR 302 to EUR 330 in the case of gas oil .
<en> The approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015 .
<en> In the case of unleaded petrol , unfortunately , there will be no change by this means .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted against the Schmidt report because what the European Parliament has engaged in here , instead of supporting the Commission initiative , is a sort of conjuring trick playing off the old against the new Member States .
<en> In any event the decision will ultimately rest with the Ministers alone and it will have to be unanimous .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We believe that the original purpose of the programme - to distribute intervention stocks to the most deprived persons - was strangely worded right from the start .
<en> Mixing agricultural policy with social policy may be commendable , but it gets complicated .
<en> Recently , the proportion of goods not coming from intervention stocks has steadily increased .
<en> At the last reckoning , around 85 % of the food was bought on the open market .
<en> We believe that the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Community should be abolished .
<en> The circumstances of the most deprived persons in the Member States should be dealt with by the Member States or the municipalities .
<en> It is these political levels of responsibility which should ensure , via their social policy , that all citizens get their right to a minimum level of subsistence .
<en> Whether this is done via social security benefits , the distribution of food or by other means should be their decision .
<en> The European Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes that the food aid be funded in full by the EU .
<en> The views that are put forward in this committee simply to get agricultural products on the market are astounding .
<en> As usual , the June List observes that , in this situation , it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU 's agricultural policy .
<en> Otherwise , the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to various groups within agriculture .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) The Dutch People 's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) delegation in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Siekierski report , as we support food distribution to the poorest population groups in the EU .
<en> However , the VVD MEPs do not agree with the provisions of the report that state that the food distribution programmes must be funded exclusively from the EU budget .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because the food programme whose extension is being considered is a key instrument for helping the deprived who are suffering a great deal in the current economic crisis , even when it comes to meeting basic needs .
<2en> In addition , it is a sensible measure in terms of using the EU 's food resources effectively because it distributes the products which have been left unused to those who need them , while , at the same time , boosting demand on the EU 's food market .
<2en> I am in favour of such food aid assistance programmes receiving full funding from the EU budget as applying cofinancing rates would significantly impede the process and hamper the implementation of the measures in good time and the achievement of rapid results .
<2en> However , I think that national authorities must be granted more functions with regard to administering the aid on site because they are more familiar with the situation at local level and with the population 's specific needs .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Liberal Party 's MEPs have voted against the European Commission 's proposal on food distribution to the most deprived persons because the proposal has been tabled with a legal basis in agricultural policy , even though it is not an agricultural policy instrument .
<en> The agricultural budget should not be used to implement social policy .
<en> This is the responsibility of the Member States .

<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski 's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
<2en> I believe that the problem of poverty is highly relevant as , even in affluent Europe , more than 80 million people are at risk of poverty and the vast majority of these live in the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 .
<2en> I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to expand the range of products provided through this food aid programme and on the fact that the primary source of supply should be represented by reserves deriving from intervention in the agricultural markets , thus constituting an important aspect of the common agricultural policy .
<2en> I also welcome the rapporteur 's call for the entire funding for the food aid programme to be provided by the EU , since the Commission 's co-financing proposal could lead Member States to limit their participation in the programme , particularly at times of economic hardship such as many states are currently experiencing .

<en> Mr President , I want to raise the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos , who is in prison in Greece .
<en> His family , who are my constituents , are convinced of his innocence .
<en> At the beginning of this year , I wrote to the Minister of Justice in Athens raising the case .
<en> I did not get a reply , so in a one-minute speech here in May in this Hemicycle I raised the question .
<en> Immediately after I had spoken , the Greek Permanent Representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the Minister in person .
<en> Four months later : nothing .
<en> If the Greek Permanent Representation is listening to us now in the Hemicycle , I would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened .
<en> Would they please get me a reply from the Minister and look at the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos again ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 , a Turkish journalist photographed 14 Cypriot soldiers surrendering to the Turkish army .
<en> This photograph became the symbol of the search for the fate of the missing persons .
<en> The soldiers ' bodies were identified through DNA a few weeks ago after they were killed 35 years ago and thrown down a well in the occupied northern part of the island .
<en> This demonstrates the blatant violation of the Geneva Convention by the Turkish Army , who were responsible for prisoners who surrendered to them .
<en> I urge this Parliament to call on Turkey to cooperate with the UN Committee on Missing Persons by providing its records and by opening two recently designated plots in Lapithos , called ' restricted military areas ' , where another 800 prisoners are believed to be buried .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this Parliament will have many important discussions , and decisions to make , on budget matters .
<en> Currently we are , of course , looking at the 2010 budget , and there are still a lot of issues to be resolved before we can agree that .
<en> This Parliament will also soon start discussing the new financial perspective for the period post 2013 .
<en> But there is also the mid-term budget review , and it seems to me we have almost forgotten about that .
<en> We should not forget about it , because this will give us great opportunities in the future .
<en> It will give us the opportunity to look again at what our priorities are .
<en> It will give us the opportunity , for example , to put more funds into a new economic regeneration plan for Europe .
<en> It will also , perhaps , give us the opportunity to put extra funding into the measures which come out of Copenhagen at the end of this year .
<en> I believe that this Parliament should not take its eye off the ball .
<en> This Parliament should continue to press the Council and the Commission to make sure it looks again at that mid-term review and to give us the opportunity to put forward our priorities .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Freedom of speech , Mr President , including the freedom to choose the language you wish to speak , is a fundamental human right .
<en> A language is a symbol of paramount importance to the people who speak it , the basis for their self-identity .
<en> Anyone who thinks this of their own language must respect the language of every other community .
<en> However , one of the EU 's official languages , Hungarian , has recently come under attack in Slovakia , in a way which goes completely against the European mindset .
<en> Its language law blatantly discriminates against the right of the half a million-strong Hungarian community to use its own language .
<en> In some cases , a fine of EUR 5 000 may also be imposed .
<en> The European Union is committed to cultural and linguistic diversity , and a commissioner for multilingualism was even appointed with this in mind .
<en> The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which has also been ratified by Slovakia , guarantees the right of citizens to use their mother tongue at every education level , for administrative matters , in public institutions and official documents .
<en> The only mainstay of the EU institutions cannot allow one of the Member States to blatantly contravene fundamental EU norms and launch an attack against minority rights without speaking out .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) The House debated the situation of the Polish shipbuilding industry a few months ago .
<en> Agreement was reached .
<en> Mr Schulz , the chairman of our political group , confirmed on behalf of the group that Parliament did not consent to doing away with tens of thousands of jobs in shipyards and at the undertakings supplying them .
<en> Mr Schulz confirmed that the House did not agree with closing down this industry in Poland , or with the consequent reduction in Europe 's industrial capacity .
<en> Six months have elapsed and the situation is as follows .
<en> The government has been unable to privatise the shipyards , the Commission has taken no account whatsoever of Parliament 's position , the yards are not producing , the future is uncertain , people have lost their jobs and have been left in limbo .
<en> We must surely all agree that this Commission lacks any concept of a European industrial policy , and has failed to understand that ships were needed in the past , that they are needed now and that they will continue to be needed in the years to come .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The coordination of certain provisions laid down by law , regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the broadcasting of television programmes is vital for the creation of a media space where the main theme is unity in diversity .
<2en> It is just as important for us to be able to make European legislation as accessible as possible to all citizens .
<2en> The report on the proposal for the Audiovisual Media Services Directive in its codified form , tabled before the plenary session , is purely a technical and legal measure whose benefits are , however , unquestionable .
<2en> Codifying legislation which is constantly changing is a measure that gives Community law greater clarity and transparency , making it easier for EU citizens to understand .
<2en> In this case , the codification proposal involves replacing the old 1989 directive with a new directive ( without modifying the content ) to which the acts that have supplemented it over the years have been added .
<2en> I supported this initiative because , apart from its technical nature , we cannot overlook its value in supporting the proper operation of audiovisual media services , not to mention in terms of transparency as well .
<sp>
<2en> I concur with the text of this report since pluralism of information ought to be a fundamental principle of the European Union .
<2en> Diversification of mass media leads to a proliferation of points of view , which is an essential feature in a democratic society .
<2en> This argument also has an economic element .
<2en> Conventional audiovisual media services ( such as television ) and those which have recently emerged ( for example , video on demand ) offer major employment opportunities in Europe , particularly through small- and medium-sized enterprises which will , in turn , boost economic growth and investment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This concerns the codification of legislation concerning the protection of workers from exposure to asbestos .
<en> I am in favour of such codification and have hence voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> Like the majority of my fellow Members , I voted in favour of making Community legislation clearer and more transparent .
<2en> Indeed , by adopting this resolution , the European Parliament has supported the European Commission 's desire to ' clean up ' the texts by codifying the legislation on the protection of workers against asbestos .
<2en> This resolution will mean that these rules , which are necessary for workers , can be applied better .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This concerns the codification of legislation concerning veterinary checks on animals entering the EU , and I have therefore voted in favour .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> One of the prime objectives of the next European Council will be to ensure the success of the UN Conference on climate change , which will take place in Copenhagen in December .
<2en> The Council 's conclusions on the EU 's position in the Copenhagen conference are fundamental for ensuring that the EU speaks with one voice .
<2en> It is important to keep an ambitious negotiating position .
<2en> The EU should demonstrate that it is united and set an example of leadership , especially by helping developing countries , which will face costs of about EUR 100 billion per year from 2020 in order to adapt to the impacts of climate change and reduce their emissions .
<2en> Establishing the structure of a funding system for developing countries , particularly the least developed , is of paramount importance , along with defining the sources and amounts of this funding , so as to ensure an agreement in Copenhagen .
<2en> This agreement will allow a protocol to come into force that will replace the Kyoto Protocol from 1 January 2013 and will ensure an effective reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , while allowing European industry to remain competitive in global markets .
<sp>
<2en> We are hoping that by the final October session of the European Council at the latest , the final obstacles will have disappeared preventing the Treaty of Lisbon from coming into force .
<2en> This agreement may , in many respects , inspire the European Union to have a more efficient decision-making process .
<2en> I would like to highlight one example : energy security .
<2en> One sign of progress is that , unlike up until now , energy policy has been given a separate section in an EC Treaty .
<2en> Based on the events of the last few years , I think that the new chapter will set out the guidelines in the EU 's energy policy .
<2en> The objectives to be supported include the development of energy efficiency , support for the use of renewable sources and the interconnection of networks .
<2en> As an MEP from a new Member State , I am particularly pleased that the concept of solidarity also features in the new energy chapter .
<2en> However , the Treaty of Lisbon does not in any way , at least when it comes to energy policy , present us with a ready-made solution .
<2en> The inclusion of the new chapter acts much more as a warning : Europe needs to take urgent steps to reduce its dependency and promote its environmental views .
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon in itself offers absolutely no guarantee , just an opportunity .
<2en> This is an opportunity for Member States to consolidate the foundations of a common EU energy policy , while being aware of their own interests .
<2en> The development of alternative supply routes , the interconnection of networks or even the provision of protection against external purchases cannot be conceived in the future without a suitable degree of political determination and cooperation from Member States .
<sp>
<2en> The impact of Ireland 's approval of the Treaty of Lisbon is making itself felt across the whole European continent .
<2en> The purpose of this Treaty is obviously to simplify the decision-making process after the EU 's expansion towards the east .
<2en> Against this background , the message conveyed by our partners in Ireland is in support of solidarity among Europe 's citizens .
<2en> We are also talking about one of the last European Councils to be held under the EU 's rotating presidency system .
<2en> This fact is all the more significant in that the selection has to take place of the occupants of the main posts that will be held in the coming years .
<2en> This is an issue which has triggered lively debates , involving countless political sensitivities .
<2en> In my opinion , our task is to deal with an issue where clear-cut principles must take priority over any feelings of pride of the moment .
<2en> It is our duty to offer the European Union consistency , efficiency , a long-term future and balanced development for all regions so that it can face up to the challenges on the global political stage , whether we are talking about the economic crisis , climate change , our common identity , etc .
<2en> Indeed , the European Union will acquire the strength it deserves only when we are on the same wavelength at a global level and when we can be identified as an entity that takes united action .
<2en> ( The sitting was suspended for a few minutes )

<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the various political groups on their excellent work on this report , which I fully support .
<2en> Within the report , I would like to focus attention on the negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement .
<2en> In fact , such agreements should take account of varied critical aspects , such as the effects of the financial crisis , the increase in migratory flows and , above all , in illegal immigration .
<2en> I am convinced that only an adequate assessment of economic cooperation would make it possible to control the negative impact of the crisis and its consequences , both for the economy of ACP countries , which are losing that workforce and that qualified labour that are necessary for development , and for EU countries that are the worst hit by illegal immigration .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - It is important that all aspects of the Cotonou Agreement are reviewed in the light of recent developments which are having a significant impact on ACP countries .
<en> But I would particularly like to add my voice to the concerns about regional integration , which is relevant not just to ACP countries but also to Latin American countries and particularly the Andean Community .
<en> The effect of some trade agreements ( agreements which are , according to Commission officials , supposed to promote development ) can be to jeopardise trade between countries in a given region and therefore run contrary to the stated development objective of promoting regional integration .
<en> The European Union must constantly re-evaluate its trade policies and the impact they have in this regard .
<en> Failure to do so , or to act appropriately , risks negative effects on long-term development .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I will vote for this report but I must make the point that certain organisations supported by the Commission , given the responsibility of delivering projects under EU-ACP partnerships , have been mired in corruption and have orchestrated a campaign of discrimination and victimisation against the members of staff who brought the said corruption to light .
<en> I refer , of course , to the organisation known as CDE , who , with Commission support , have dismissed all whistleblowers from office and have done little to put right failings in the governance and senior management of this organisation .
<en> When the OLAF investigation into CDE found that corruption had taken place and that the Commission had failed to exercise due diligence as members of the management board of the CDE at the time the fraud was taking place , one would have expected action and certainly protection for the whistleblowers concerned .
<en> Neither has happened , to the ultimate shame of the European Commission .
<en> Whilst I vote in favour today , I wonder whether there is an urgent need in future to examine in more detail what appears to be the inability of the EU side of these partnerships to exercise proper financial control .
<sp>
<2en> The Cotonou Agreement , dating from 2000 , which regulates the cooperation between the EU and the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) countries , is revised every five years .
<2en> Its objectives are the eradication of poverty and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the global economy , whilst adhering to the objective of sustainable development .
<2en> This revision is taking place against the background of a global financial crisis , rapid climate change , strain on food and energy prices , and a discussion on land use and the sustainability of foreign investment .
<2en> It is high time we strengthened parliamentary control of the country strategies and the European Development Fund ( EDF ) and strove for consistency in our trade , foreign and development policies .
<2en> It is time we took a holistic approach to tackling climate change and put the maximum focus on renewable energy .
<2en> It is time we combated illicit financial flow from developing countries and reformed European Investment Bank ( EIB ) policy in the direction of greater transparency with regard to tax havens .
<2en> It is high time we recognised that land ownership and clean water are fundamental rights .
<2en> It is time we admitted that fair access to natural resources really can help lift people out of poverty .
<2en> The report emphasises this , and thus receives my support .
<sp>
<2en> I abstained on Mrs Joly 's report on the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement .
<2en> This report contains a large number of specific proposals on the renegotiation of this agreement - more commonly known as the Cotonou Agreement - which I support .
<2en> For example , the need to take account of the situation of the world 's poorest countries , in the light of their particular characteristics with regard to climate change , democracy and human rights , brain drain , corruption , and the particular features of their economy , particularly their agricultural economy .
<2en> However , the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) adopted in plenary alter the report completely .
<2en> A particular example is Amendment 3 , which denies populations the right to define their own agrarian policies .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the second revision of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement ( the ' Cotonou Agreement ' ) .
<2en> This agreement , which regulates the political , trade and development cooperation relations between the European Union and the 77 ACP countries , and which relates to the period 2000-2020 , was already revised in 2005 .
<2en> In the provisions forming the subject of the second revision , it is rightly requested that ad hoc provisions relating to climate change be included , that the provisions relating to renewable energy be reviewed , that the provisions relating to rural development and food safety be enhanced , and that greater efforts be made to curb illegal financial flows and tax havens .
<2en> I am certain that this revision will be able to strengthen the partnership relations between the EU and ACP countries and to ensure greater synergy and cooperation in view of the common objectives to be achieved .
<chp>

<en> The debate is closed .
<en> I said earlier that it is not possible to give the floor to others .
<en> If there is a request on a point of order , I can give the floor .
<en> Please proceed .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would just like to understand one thing : if only one or a few language versions are available , then I would like to know the language skills of the Members of the Commission and the Council who signed the agreement and who decided on it on 30 November - so it must be available .
<sp>
<en> That was not a point of order , but we allowed it because Mrs in ' t Veld was so polite in her request to take the floor .
<en> Please proceed , Minister .
<sp>
<2en> I repeat what I said .
<2en> I will check the information given to me by Mrs Harms , I think it was , regarding the document .
<2en> I am not sure because I do not have it with me , of course , and I will let her know what happened on this matter .
<2en> In any case , I repeat , on 25 January , you will have the agreement and we will be able to discuss it as much as you like .
<2en> The Spanish Presidency , the government and the Council are at your disposal to talk for as long as you like , in depth , about this agreement whose future entry into force will depend on the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> One exception soon becomes many , and I cannot deny Mr Schulz the floor .
<en> Please proceed , Mr Schulz .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) Mr President , following the Copenhagen fiasco , we could sit on the sidelines pitifully weeping and wailing , but that would be a waste of energy .
<en> Let us continue to put our own house in order .
<en> Europe is the only continent to have specific , ambitious legislation for reducing CO2 emissions .
<en> This must be implemented in the coming months and years .
<en> We must not forget that this also has a direct impact on other superpowers , not least China .
<en> All the consumer products China wishes to sell in Europe in the near future will have to comply with the strictest European environmental standards .
<en> This obliges Chinese manufacturers , too , to change course .
<en> ' Hopenhagen ' may have largely failed , but we must set to work again , as next year will see new opportunities , first in Bonn and then in Mexico .
<en> In the meantime , Copenhagen has undoubtedly made sure everyone is alert , greatly heightening our environmental awareness .
<en> That is not enough , but what makes me optimistic is the realisation that investing in the climate is also good for our own pockets , for the economy and thus also for employment .
<sp>
<2en> The environment summit in Copenhagen has been described by many as a resounding failure as its outcome was a vague agreement without any clear assumptions and deadlines .
<2en> However , if we look more closely at what happened in the Danish capital , we can see that the foundations were laid here for a new global climate order which we are going to achieve , but after years and years of hard work and negotiations .
<2en> This was the first time that 115 Heads of State or Government met to discuss climate change .
<2en> This is an important sign .
<2en> The fact that the summit took place under the aegis of the UN highlights that even the developing and poorly industrialised countries realise that they need to play an active role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions .
<2en> The importance of bilateral discussions between powerful industrialised states and developing states has grown , especially in light of the next summit on environmental issues in Mexico .
<2en> The EU has all the data available to play an important role in bilateral discussions with states such as China , India or Brazil .
<2en> The time has come when no effort will seem too great when we are talking about the future of the planet we all share together .
<sp>
<2en> For the last month , ' failure ' has been the word most used to describe the Copenhagen Summit .
<2en> The summit 's unsatisfactory outcome is due to both the reticence shown by the large industrialised countries and the system 's complicated rules based on the UN 's consensus .
<2en> Furthermore , the European Union 's inability to assume the role of catalyst for the global efforts to restrict the effects of climate change should be examined .
<2en> By announcing unilaterally a year before this conference its intention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by 2020 , the EU had the moral upper hand to provide a fillip to the negotiations in Copenhagen .
<2en> However , we did not know how to make our voice heard in a meeting dominated by the positions of the US and emerging countries .
<2en> A more restricted format of discussions is required so that we can hope for negotiations ending in success .
<2en> The ministerial meetings in Bonn and Mexico City in June and December must be used as effectively as possible to leave the way open for adopting a new treaty .
<2en> Member States must coordinate their actions so that we speak with a single voice on the global stage .
<sp>
<2en> The fiasco of the climate summit has exposed Europe 's weakness and the naivety of its political elite .
<2en> It has shown that we are only one of many players on the world stage .
<2en> Why did the proposals concerning CO2 emissions turn out to be unacceptable ?
<2en> It was because they threaten the interests of many developing countries , do not take account of competition based on the military economy worldwide , unfairly distribute the right to use the common good , which is the Earth , and are based on the not very credible hypothesis put forward by the IPCC on the harmfulness of CO2 , while , as it turns out , the so-called ' proofs ' have been manipulated ( Climategate ) .
<2en> Science must not be politically controlled , but should take account of all circumstances and answer every possible question .
<2en> Has anyone asked , for example , what would happen if there were not enough CO2 in the atmosphere ?
<2en> We should be glad about the warm period in the contemporary history of our planet and that , at the moment , we have around 370-380 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere .
<2en> In physics and chemistry we know Le Chatelier 's principle of equilibrium , which predicts development of the ideal conditions for photosynthesis .
<2en> The Earth is becoming greener , a fact which has been confirmed many times , and this guarantees greater harvests and better conditions for development .
<2en> Let it continue this way , although , unfortunately , there are many signs that , in the next two decades , the world will get cooler .
<2en> Conclusion : the European Union should immediately review its restrictive climate and energy package , because it reduces the competitiveness of the EU economy .
<sp>
<2en> The current liberal trade regulations encourage higher carbon dioxide emissions .
<2en> By introducing emissions trading , supporting renewable sources of energy and through investment aimed at improving energy efficiency , developed nations are making considerable efforts to curb their carbon dioxide emissions .
<2en> These measures result in additional costs for businesses .
<2en> What is more , energy consumption is increasingly taxed in these countries .
<2en> Meanwhile , many developing countries do nothing to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases .
<2en> They even constantly increase their carbon dioxide emissions .
<2en> Instead of giving the largest industrial users incentives to embrace energy efficiency , they provide them with electricity at subsidised rates .
<2en> Many say that nowadays , the most important comparative advantage of these countries is no longer cheap labour but cheap energy .
<2en> This is why new international trade regulations need to be put in place that prevent trade from leading to further carbon dioxide emissions .
<2en> We need not only ' fair ' but also ' green ' trade .
<2en> To this end , we need to ensure that if a country fails to fulfil its commitments made in climate change agreements , there are effective legal sanctions in place .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The housing situation in the EU is critical .
<2en> What we need is a European policy of decent housing for all , a binding and ambitious EU social housing policy .
<2en> Of course , it was essential for Parliament to adopt a position on the renovation of insalubrious housing and the replacement of slums with decent accommodation , but it is just as essential and just as urgent for the EU to make the availability of decent accommodation a fundamental human right .
<2en> It has a duty and the means to ensure this .
<2en> The EU cannot allow itself to become a socially underdeveloped region .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The adoption of this report is very important , because it makes an amendment to the European Regional Development Fund that will help marginalised members of the public , whether or not they live in urban areas .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report and I want to emphasise that such regular reviews of the texts regulating the use of European funds are welcome .
<2en> Many of the restrictions stipulated by these regulations are no longer suited to the current economic and social situation , thereby necessitating new forms of intervention .
<2en> Another example in this regard is the relaxation of the conditions for using ERDF funds to improve energy efficiency in housing , approved by Parliament last spring .
<sp>
<2en> The current worldwide economic crisis represents a difficult challenge for the European Union , which is in need of policies offering rapid , flexible and efficient responses .
<2en> With its total financial resources of EUR 347 billion for the programming period 2007-2013 , the European Cohesion Policy is the greatest source of investment in the real economy , able to help Europe and its regions to recover from the crisis and to regain confidence and optimism .
<2en> I agree with the need to deal with the question of housing for marginalised communities , in the context of a change in the ERDF regulation .
<2en> Since the current laws cannot be applied to marginalised communities , the proposed change would fill a gap in the legislation , in order to cope with the problem of these people 's precarious conditions of life in a more appropriate way .
<2en> This measure respects the principle of subsidiarity , increasing the ability of Member States to provide support and housing aid for marginalised communities , in whatever way they judge to be most appropriate , and , at the same time , maintaining the integrated approach as a minimum condition for implementing the aid .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate Mr van Nistelrooij on the excellent text he proposed , which has been further improved by numerous amendments tabled within the Committee on Regional Development , allowing this measure to be extended to all the European Union Member States .
<2en> Today 's text will enable us to make the dreams of many people who wish to own their own homes come true .
<2en> I am certain that , in doing this , we will show our citizens that Parliament is capable of finding solutions to the challenges posed by opening up borders and by the free movement of people .
<2en> And for this reason , I will vote in favour of the report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Given the importance of an integrated energy policy , not only in combating climate change and reducing CO2 emissions , but also in ensuring efficiency and less energy dependence within Europe , communication and transmission of information about investments and energy infrastructure projects is crucial .
<2en> It is vital for European energy policy that the Commission has a current view of trends in energy investments within the Member States so as to be able to develop integrated policies to promote greater energy efficiency and investment in cleaner technologies , thus ensuring progressive energy independence in the face of external suppliers and fossil fuels .
<2en> In view of this , I support the proposal for a regulation , particularly with regard to its necessary implementation , which did not happen with the regulation that it seeks to replace .
<sp>
<2en> This proposal for a regulation contributes to establishing a European energy policy that aims at efficiency , reliability and security .
<2en> Energy efficiency is a priority policy for the European Union given the need to preserve and maximise resources and fulfil the commitments that it has made in combating climate change .
<2en> I would remind you that before moving on to new projects , the EU 's objective of achieving the target of 20 % for energy efficiency must be taken into account .
<2en> This means that investment projects in energy infrastructures must be compatible with the aim of achieving a minimum of 20 % of energy from sustainable , renewable sources by 2020 .
<2en> The energy policy that is being advocated must ensure low carbon emissions and be based on solidarity and sustainability .
<2en> The reliability of the system is important , as operation must be continuous .
<2en> It must take account of the deterioration of the energy sector in terms of supply , which can be seen both inside and outside the EU .
<2en> It is also worth paying attention to crucial investment in infrastructure that manages to avoid security problems in terms of energy supply .
<sp>
<2en> The rapporteur considers that this is indeed an important piece of the puzzle in the EU energy policy , reasoning that we cannot effectively promote a European energy policy at EU level without having adequate information about our energy infrastructure .
<2en> Yet , beyond our fundamental disagreement about European energy policy , this report can also be placed within a legal context , or within the framework of the internal market .
<2en> However , some positive aspects are also considered here , particularly when it states that it is essential that the confidentiality of information is ensured and that any resulting proposals are neutral and do not amount to market intervention on a political level .
<2en> Furthermore , the reporting requirements should be easy to fulfil , so as to avoid any unnecessary administrative burden on undertakings , and the administration of Member States or of the Commission .
<2en> Hence our final decision to abstain .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Vălean report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community .
<2en> Indeed , it is crucial to have a sufficiently detailed overview in order to strike a better balance between the supply and demand of energy at European level and to decide on the shrewdest investments in terms of infrastructure .
<2en> This will also make it possible to increase transparency on the markets ( while protecting corporate data ) and to prevent the phenomena of energy dependence with regard to one particular source or site of supply .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Despite the disappointment of Copenhagen , the EU cannot allow the lack of international consensus to slow down our own efforts in effecting a sustainable energy policy .
<en> The Scottish Government is continuing to pioneer in the field of renewable energy and the EU has an important role , too , in driving forward the agenda .
<en> The effective promotion of our energy policy requires adequate information on infrastructure and I voted accordingly today .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me firstly congratulate and thank the rapporteur , Mr Giegold , who has proposed a work of high quality and has shown himself ready to listen to the rapporteurs from other groups .
<2en> This report , the European Parliament 's response to the European Commission annual statement on the euro area and public finances , is rich in analyses and proposals .
<2en> Of course , it is , to a great extent , marked by the big event of 2009 , the economic and financial crisis , which is without any doubt the most serious crisis the European Union has faced since it was created .
<2en> I have learnt two main lessons from this crisis .
<2en> On the one hand , the Economic and Monetary Union has shown how useful it is .
<2en> The euro , a stable common currency , has played the part of a real monetary shield .
<2en> Belonging to the euro area has enabled more than one country to avoid a devaluation of their national currencies , which would have further exacerbated the consequences of the crisis .
<2en> The euro area has therefore become more attractive , as the case of Iceland shows .
<2en> Moreover , the active and flexible monetary policy conducted by the ECB , increasing its injections of liquid funds into lending establishments , has played a significant role in keeping European banks afloat .
<2en> The first lesson then is that while we often say that Europe was built on crises , this one has shown that economic Europe is both effective and necessary at the same time .
<2en> From this I draw the second lesson , which is that we should strengthen European economic governance .
<2en> Today , the only genuine European economic policy is monetary policy .
<2en> There is limited coordination of budget policies .
<2en> However , the euro area , which - as mentioned again by this report - is intended to integrate all the Member States of the European Union , must establish effective governance in every aspect of economic policy .
<2en> It must begin with macro-economic as well as financial monitoring , something we are busy working on in the European Parliament .
<2en> It must be carried forward within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact as a real instrument of fiscal coordination .
<2en> At this time of crisis , the considerable drop in revenue , the tax incentive measures taken within the framework of the recovery plan and the operation of economic stabilisers have led to a deterioration of the budget balances of the Member States .
<2en> Reducing public debt remains a fundamental commitment , as it concerns our children 's future .
<2en> Let us be austere , but let us also be inventive .
<2en> Let us think about a new European fiscal policy , let us think about eurobonds , and let us be bold in European economic governance .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Giegold 's report is particularly significant given the current macro-economic debate .
<2en> This report is all the more relevant given the fact that its author is a German MEP who wanted to draw the attention of Europeans to the distorted effects , for the countries of the euro area , of the German strategy of reducing labour costs in the single currency system .
<2en> The German Government is , in fact , about to drag the euro area and the whole of the European Union into generalised wage deflation with damaging macro-economic consequences .
<2en> Particularly in the absence of consistent structural funds and sufficient budgetary resources , and faced with the impossibility of devaluation , Member States with current accounts in deficit are condemned , in order to resist , to trim their wages and reduce the perimeter of their social security systems .
<2en> The result is firstly a slowdown in internal demand which , since the second quarter of 2008 , has led to negative growth , and this was even before the start of the liquidity crisis .
<2en> Secondly , we are seeing a rise in the personal debt of households with modest incomes and means , whose purchasing power is no longer increasing .
<2en> Their debt to acquire homes was fed by the whole deregulated financial machinery , in Spain , in the United Kingdom and in Ireland , with the disastrous consequences we have observed in the subprime crisis .
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , listening to the debates in committee , a significant number of MEPs would seem to be forgetting the lessons of this crisis .
<2en> This crisis is far from behind us .
<2en> The current recovery is all the more fragile given the fact that Europe is continuing with wage deflation and the Commission , but also the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the European Central Bank - whom we heard on Monday - are calling on the Member States to prematurely adopt exit policies that are comparable to real austerity plans .
<2en> These policies risk nipping growth in the bud when it has barely become positive again , even though capacity utilisation rates remain low .
<2en> These policies will fail to reduce the deficits in Greece , in Spain and elsewhere , because the expected tax revenue will fail to materialise also .
<2en> They will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions .
<2en> The Giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro-economic imbalances .
<2en> Unfortunately , the final version , amended by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , refuses to condemn wage deflation .
<2en> However , on the whole , the debate opened by Mr Giegold may be beneficial at a time when neoliberal dogma thrown into doubt by the crisis is back in force in Parliament , in the Council and in the Commission .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs Mr Scicluna - who knows a great deal about central banks - and Mr Giegold .
<2en> We held long discussions with them and in the end , agreed on many compromise amendments .
<2en> I would like to talk to you today about the euro .
<2en> I would like to point out to you all that I am new to politics : until nine months ago , I was giving classes on macro-economics at the University of Barcelona .
<2en> In the autumn of 2008 , my family and I were living in London for academic reasons and I was a direct witness of the pound sterling 's sudden drop of 30 % over the course of a few weeks .
<2en> All of a sudden , all my English colleagues had become poorer , and the pound has still not recovered today .
<2en> In light of how much the pound has dropped , I do not even want to imagine what the value of the peseta would be today if we still had that in our wallets .
<2en> These two years of terrible global economic crisis have shown that the euro has firmly anchored us to stability .
<2en> It is , in fact , the only major Western currency that has not made its users poorer .
<2en> The euro has been a secure port against the huge waves of the global financial storms , to borrow the evocative image of the British financier David Marsh .
<2en> A convinced Eurosceptic for many years , 12 months ago , this respected public financier published a book praising the euro , acknowledging it as a success and as the future global currency .
<2en> The euro is not in crisis today : it is the fiscal crises of certain Member States that are causing the single currency difficulties .
<2en> The euro is a shining example of monetary union that is being studied and admired by the economic elites of China , India , Brazil and Russia .
<2en> The euro poses no risk to the Mediterranean economies .
<2en> The euro is the opportunity for their economies to be permanently integrated into the good , reforming and advanced practices of the countries of Central Europe .
<2en> The report that we are debating today includes severe criticism of the practice of state intervention in the Chinese currency .
<2en> Its artificial devaluation has contributed to the creation of the huge global imbalances that are one of the causes of this crisis .
<2en> We in the euro area must not penalise the countries that export the most .
<2en> The history of financial crises shows us that , once financial health has been achieved , economic recovery comes hand-in-hand with exports .
<2en> It is true that Germany needs to begin consuming again and do more as the motor for European economic growth .
<2en> Nevertheless , under no circumstances must its export strength be weakened .
<2en> I am a liberal Member from Catalonia , and my region - which is the source of 28 % of Spain 's exports - also has a very high ratio of exports to gross domestic product : almost 30 % .
<2en> Those who do best cannot be penalised .
<2en> Finally , the euro now has a great deal of prestige worldwide , but it needs to make a little more effort to be transparent .
<2en> Mr Trichet , the verbatim records of the debates of the European Central Bank should be published , as is the case in the United States , Japan and Sweden .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , since I would like Commissioner Rehn to understand me loud and clear , I will speak in English .
<en> I would like , starting from where we are today , to take a look forward .
<en> Where are we ?
<en> We have huge and unsustainable public deficits and , mind you , the Greens do not support this kind of deficit .
<en> Second , we cannot ignore the fact that we already have huge and deepening social inequalities .
<en> 16 % of Europeans below the poverty level is not a small figure ; 40 % of young Spaniards under 25 unemployed is not a small figure , and I could carry on .
<en> Then we are facing climate change and resource scarcity , and all this means there is a need for investment in infrastructure , in education , in research and innovation , etc .
<en> So what we believe is that we should really switch gear .
<en> Herman Van Rompuy said , after the February summit , that coordination of macro-economic policy needs to be considerably increased and improved .
<en> Of course .
<en> What does that mean ?
<en> It means , of course , that in terms of budgetary expenditure , we need to have more peer review , more ex ante control .
<en> Greece has 4 % of its GDP going to military spending .
<en> They have got an air force that is as big as the Luftwaffe .
<en> I mean , how come ?
<en> It is such a tiny country and they are arming themselves like hell .
<en> But if we just look at the expenditure side , we will not succeed .
<en> We need to look , and to take a hard look , at coordinating our tax revenue because , what do we need to do ?
<en> We need to rebalance tax income away from labour income towards other forms of income , including capital income .
<en> We need to make sure that we have an effective corporate contribution - effective , not just on paper - and that means CCCTB country-by-country reporting , etc .
<en> We need to implement the financial transaction tax ; we need to implement the carbon tax , both to shift behaviour and to provide income .
<en> And we cannot do that just by asking countries to coordinate their policies .
<en> We need more integration .
<en> If we do not do that , our governments will prove incapable of reconciling the need to balance budgets and to meet social needs and investment needs .
<en> So I believe that Europe is now at a critical juncture .
<en> The choice is between a higher degree of integration , not just coordination , and decline .
<en> The lesson that I take from Copenhagen is not just that we missed the climate agreement .
<en> It is that Europe has proved to be irrelevant if it is not acting together .
<en> We spend too much time coordinating , too little time acting together .
<en> So that would be our contribution to this debate .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , coming from a non-eurozone Member State , I am not sure whether my opinion holds much weight with my colleagues in this debate .
<en> Currently , many would claim that the eurozone problem is one which should be solved by eurozone members .
<en> However , the euro does not sit in isolation .
<en> It sits in the global market and has been affected by the global financial and economic crisis just as those outside the eurozone have .
<en> How we manage our states ' finances during the good years entirely affects how we are able to react and recover today .
<en> As many have pointed out , there is a reason why Germany faces a very different government deficit to Greece .
<en> While they may be united by a common currency , attitudes towards saving and spending vary considerably .
<en> Joining a monetary union did not unite completely different cultures and traditions of fiscal policy .
<en> The UK perspective has a lot to say on differences in fiscal policy .
<en> We also bloated our public sector , spent and spent in the good years , borrowing more and more to create debts we could not even admit to when it looked as though the good times were gone forever , and creating a culture where a supposedly respected economist from the UK even last week stood up in front of one of our committees and claimed that governments can magic money .
<en> Fundamentally , money to fund the public sector does not magically appear .
<en> It comes from tax receipts from the private sector .
<en> Germany realises this .
<en> Its policies in the recent past have focused upon using government spending and incentives to help stimulate the private sector .
<en> Hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
<en> Ultimately , the public sector has done its job in the crisis .
<en> It bailed out the banks and stepped up when the private sector failed .
<en> Now it is the turn of the private sector to replenish the coffers .
<en> The downside of austerity measures , which will put hardworking people out of public sector jobs , must be turned into an upside for start-up companies , taking advantage of entrepreneurial spirit by reducing start-up costs for businesses so that they can create the profitable private sector that is required to dig all of our countries out of the holes we now find ourselves in .
<en> All of those countries that have practised unsustainable economic policies for the past few years - including my own - need to realise that change is essential and inevitable .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The fact that the Treaty of Lisbon did not enter into force in time to be immediately applicable to the elections for the 2009-2014 term of the European Parliament led to a problem that has ended up , I believe , being resolved sensibly and in a way that reflects the inevitable difficulties of transition periods .
<2en> Therefore , while it would not make sense or be legitimate to strip elected Members of their mandates , it would also not be reasonable to prevent the Member States that are benefiting from an increase in the number of their representatives from appointing them in accordance with the legislation governing their respective electoral systems .
<2en> The exceptional circumstances fully justify the exceptional solutions adopted .
<sp>
<2en> An increase in the total number of MEPs by 15 ( from the 736 stipulated in the Treaty of Nice to 751 ) , with 18 additional seats to be distributed among 12 Member States , has been adopted .
<2en> Germany has been allocated three fewer seats in view of the maximum number laid down in the EU Treaty .
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon had not entered into force before the 2009 European elections , so the latter were held in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Nice , meaning that the European Parliament currently has 736 Members rather than 751 .
<2en> On the other hand , the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon means that the 18 additional MEPs from the 12 Member States concerned can legitimately take their seats .
<2en> It is not possible to curtail an MEP 's mandate during a parliamentary term or , therefore , to reduce the current number of MEPs in the German delegation by three .
<2en> I therefore take the view that the amendment of Protocol No 36 requested by the European Council stems directly from the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon , and is a valid solution that will enable all those Member States entitled to additional seats to designate the MEPs concerned .
<2en> These 18 MEPs must take up their seats in Parliament at the same time in order not to upset the balance of nationalities in the House .
<sp>
<2en> As we have been asserting and as can be seen from this report , the Treaty of Lisbon not only implements neoliberal , militarist and federalist policies but is an instrument full of ambiguities and contradictions , such as those expressed in Protocol ( No 36 ) on provisions concerning the composition of the European Parliament .
<2en> The arrogance of those promoting the Treaty was so great that it prevented them from making these provisions flexible , because they had done everything to avoid referendums from being held in order to escape a vote by the peoples of the EU 's countries and a repeat of the No by the French and Dutch peoples to the so-called ' Constitutional Treaty ' .
<2en> The Irish people also said no to this travesty of a text , and it was only after much pressure and blackmail that their vote was obtained , but already after the European elections .
<2en> This report has shown the attempt by some MEPs to entrench the EU 's federalist trajectory by invoking a democratic legitimacy that the Treaty does not have .
<2en> These Members are also attempting to further subordinate national legislations to the EU 's interests with proposals that seek a uniform electoral procedure in all Member States , which is a sovereign competency of each Member State , and are demanding that a Convention be convened charged with the reform of the European Parliament to prepare for the revision of the Treaties .
<sp>
<2en> Whether the Treaties are revised by way of an Intergovernmental Conference or by way of a Convention changes absolutely nothing as far as the crux of the problem is concerned .
<2en> Whether through incompetence , negligence or political miscalculation , one single country , France , refused to anticipate the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for its representation in the European Parliament , in spite of the repeated demands of several political groups , including my own .
<2en> Consequently , today , France is the only one of the 27 that intends to appoint two new MEPs by the indirect means of a decision by a national parliament of which the voting system is thoroughly unjust .
<2en> All of this is in violation of the Treaties themselves , and in violation of the Act of 1976 , which provides for the election of MEPs by direct universal suffrage .
<2en> Moreover , complicit in this is the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , which , despite having been dealt a severe blow in the 2009 elections , will inherit one of the two extra seats .
<2en> This is scheming between friends , with the support of this Parliament .
<2en> Unfortunately , in order to pass off this anomaly , the rapporteur is hiding behind the temporary nature of the measure .
<2en> Temporary ?
<2en> The new French MEPs will sit for four years , which is more than 80 % of the parliamentary term .
<2en> I would have expected our fellow Member to have been firmer in terms of both the value of words and the defence of democratic principles .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for several amendments aimed at underlining the unacceptable nature of the choice made by France , which is appointing members of its national parliament to sit in the European Parliament alongside 16 others , who for their part stood in the election of 7 June 2009 .
<2en> In my opinion , this choice , which was clearly made amid a total lack of preparation , runs counter to fundamental democratic principles and raises important questions about the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament .
<2en> On the other hand , we must not block the arrival of the other MEPs , whose appointment is perfectly in accordance with the spirit of the Treaties .
<2en> This issue demonstrates just how necessary it is for us to provide ourselves in future with a uniform method of appointing MEPs by direct universal suffrage , with this reform to be carried out by means of a convention .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Road transport safety has always been a concern of the EU .
<2en> The adoption of this resolution is another step towards eliminating serious infringements of the social rules in this area .
<2en> Greater cooperation between Member States is necessary in order to create an easy communications network for all the sector 's professionals whenever they are working in a Member State that is not their own .
<2en> A financial effort is also necessary in order to establish an appropriate infrastructure , including a sufficient number of safe parking spaces and services , on the European road network so that drivers can , in fact , comply with the provisions on driving times and rest periods .
<2en> That is why I voted as I did .
<sp>
<2en> Statistics show that heavy duty vehicles in particular are involved in a high proportion of traffic accidents .
<2en> It is therefore that much more important the vehicle be in faultless condition .
<2en> Drivers ' attentiveness falls almost as much as a result of tiredness as it does under the influence of alcohol .
<2en> Consequently , in the name of general safety , we need to ensure compliance with these regulations .
<2en> It is important , in this regard , that the same conditions apply to employees and the self-employed so as not to push ever more people into fake self-employment , who are then utilised up to or above the limits of their tolerance .
<2en> Fines , however , are often an unsuitable way of guaranteeing compliance with rest periods , which can only be possible when a vehicle is immobilised .
<2en> As no expansion of these road safety measures is planned , I voted ' no ' .
<sp>
<2en> The report by Mrs Ranner , whom I congratulate on account of her work , sheds light not only on the differences between fines in different Member States , but also on differences surrounding the types of penalty in highlighting the unsatisfactory nature of this situation for drivers and transport enterprises .
<2en> I agree with the approach of the Parliamentary report , which underlines the importance to the internal market of fully implementing social regulations , by applying more frequent checks if necessary , establishing a European coordination instrument and harmonising infringements and their associated penalties .
<2en> Only by having a uniform arrangement will it be possible to ensure the rapid recovery of sums due for infringements .
<2en> I therefore voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> This report by my colleague in the Committee on Transport and Tourism is an excellent initiative towards solving some of the existing problems regarding the road transport penalties applicable to serious infringements .
<2en> The rules applicable in the case of serious infringements against the social rules vary considerably in each Member State with regard to the value of fines and the nature and categorisation of penalties , making greater harmonisation necessary .
<2en> I welcome the solutions proposed for such differences in the report , not least the necessary harmonised categorisation of serious infringements , and the implementation of a system of checks - coordinated at European level by a body with the appropriate characteristics - the purpose of which would be to improve cooperation on the implementation of social rules and ensure the training of inspection bodies charged with applying these rules .
<2en> I would also stress the importance of developing initiatives to provide adequate information about social rules , and create adequate infrastructure and car parks to ensure respect for the rules .
<2en> For the above reasons , I voted for the report brought before Parliament today .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - Mr President , I know colleagues do not like people speaking at this particular time , but I beg their indulgence for a few short minutes .
<en> Firstly , because this was not debated in the House , it is important that something should be said about it , particularly because of the part played by the European Union International Fund for Ireland .
<en> Secondly , most people in Ireland - and beyond Ireland - think this fund was largely funded by the USA .
<en> Of course , the USA played a huge part - and I would like to thank them for that - as did Canada , Australia and New Zealand , but it is important to point out that , in the period 2006 onwards , the European Union is actually funding 57 % of the Fund .
<en> That is not something that is widely known and , of course , having no debate on it here in Parliament meant that we kept it a secret .
<en> So I would like to highlight the part played by the European Union in helping to create contact , dialogue and reconciliation in Northern Ireland , which thankfully , though still fragile as a peace process , is still holding .
<en> I would like to pay tribute today to all the people who contributed to peace in Northern Ireland - there are so many - and particularly , I suppose , on the extremes .
<en> Parties like Dr Ian Paisley 's party - he was a member of this House for many years - and Gerry Adams ' party , who would never have been seen to come together 20 years ago , have come together in the peace process and power sharing .
<en> The European Union must take credit for this - at least its due share - and I want to highlight that today .
<en> I would like to pay tribute to all those who have taken risks for peace in Northern Ireland , and I hope that peace will continue .
<en> ( GA ) I hope that this resolution will be passed unanimously , and I applaud each person involved for the part they played in the peace process in my own country .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , I have noticed that , between the election of the Vice-President and these last few votes , 150 Members have disappeared .
<en> I do not know whether their disappearance is due to a stomach upset or a problem with the air conditioning .
<en> Perhaps we ought to investigate .
<sp>
<en> No , they did not disappear .
<en> We will give you a very clear explanation of what happened on the vote for Pastor Tőkés , but it was not divine intervention .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The International Fund for Ireland is a good example of transnational and international cooperation .
<2en> The fund , which is managed by an independent international body , is financed by several countries : the European Union , the United States , Canada , New Zealand and Australia .
<2en> Both in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic , the projects foster contact , dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists .
<2en> This international support will , however , be coming to an end in 2010 .
<2en> We should therefore consider how the fund 's action priorities might be financed after this date , especially those relating to promoting economic and social progress and encouraging the peace dialogue .
<2en> The projects covered by the International Fund for Ireland already complement the actions under the EU PEACE programmes .
<2en> It would be useful to establish what will happen to these projects in the context of the forthcoming EU budget planning .
<2en> I therefore call upon the European Commission to look into how the Structural Funds might continue the role of the International Fund for Ireland , particularly within the framework of the ' European territorial cooperation ' objective .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Following numerous years of instability in Ireland , a fund referred to as the IFI was set up for the purpose of ensuring economic and financial stability in the region .
<en> We have seen that the report looks into the plans for the fund in the future and establishes some key goals that need to be tackled .
<en> I agree with the conclusions reached by the rapporteur and hence decided to vote in favour of this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the Kelly Report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning EU financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( IFI ) .
<en> Such inter-regional cooperation and reconciliation projects should be supported , in particular , with a view to furthering social and economic progress .
<en> The IFI has been a key part of cross-community reconciliation and recognition needs to be given to the key role played by the EU in this area .
<en> Lessons can be learned from the successes of the IFI initiatives , which may be applied to other areas of the Union where there is community marginalisation and tension .
<en> The use of EU funds to support the IFI 's ' Football for Peace ' project is a point that I wish to highlight .
<en> The promotion of reconciliation and mutual understanding amongst young people through the medium of sport is an initiative which should be lauded .
<en> Indeed , the use of sport to empower individuals and combat social exclusion should not be underestimated .
<sp>
<2en> The peace process in Northern Ireland is an example of success that has deserved , and should continue to deserve , the support of the European institutions .
<2en> As with European integration , in post-conflict situations like this one , the path to stability can be forged by establishing de facto solidarities which facilitate and increase cross-border and inter-community relations .
<2en> I hope that other parts of the European Union plagued by the phenomenon of secessionist terrorism can look to the Irish process and learn lessons from it that will allow them to eradicate violence and construct a society in which everyone can feel that they belong , while respecting the law , traditions and human rights .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the extension of the International Fund for Ireland , as I believe that it is important to emphasise the European Union 's mission of peace between peoples and communities as a key factor for economic and social development , as well as for enhancing human dignity and quality of life for citizens .
<2en> This can be seen in the specific case of Ireland .
<2en> The European Union should continue to play a key role in maintaining peace and eliminating regional , ethnic and cultural tension , and thus promoting conditions for social and economic progress .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted in favour of the agreement between the European Union and the United States to share financial data for the purposes of terrorist finance tracking .
<en> We are well aware of the threat terrorism poses to our own security as well as that of our partners across the Atlantic .
<en> I do not need to remind you of all the terrorist attacks that have taken place on European soil throughout the last decade .
<en> It is also obvious that our American partners represent a very important strategic ally , not only in the area of global security , but also economically and in other areas as well .
<en> The commitment to such a strategic partnership was clearly expressed by Vice President Joe Biden in this House just a few months ago .
<en> We should therefore be proud that we finally gave consent to the agreement that is so important for efforts to track terrorist activities , especially since the new agreement contains significant improvements , and clarifications made by the European Parliament have been largely taken into account .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , there are many reasons to vote against this resolution but too many to cover in just 60 seconds .
<en> We must of course oppose terrorism but that must not be used as an excuse for governments to spy on their citizens .
<en> The confidential information concerned belongs to the citizen , not to the European Union , the Parliament or indeed the nation state .
<en> Any such agreement should be concluded between sovereign nation states , answerable to their own people through the democratic process .
<en> In any case , this is a one-sided agreement and we have no reason to believe that the United States will honour it .
<en> The agreement breaks UK data protection law , which bans the sharing of information without consent between overseas third parties .
<en> The British Government has an opt-out clause on this , and I hope they overcome their usual spinelessness and oppose and vote against it in the same way I did .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) I endorsed the Alvaro report .
<en> In order to be effective , we must have workable instruments for fighting terrorism .
<en> One very important preventative tool involves monitoring and reducing the financial resources which reach and belong to terrorists .
<en> Very often , in fact , money is the fuel for terrorist activities .
<en> If there is no money , terrorist activity is held back , and that is , of course , the aim of our efforts .
<en> Better monitoring of the flow of money can be a fundamental hindrance to terrorist activity and preparations for acts of terror , so I am very glad that we have managed to reach an understanding and that we have adopted both the agreement and the report .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report by Mr Alvaro .
<en> I think it is very important that we can fight terrorism together , and it is very important that nations that have the same values can work together .
<en> It is important to strengthen transatlantic relations between the European Union and the United States of America , and , as we know , our values are the same .
<en> Obviously , data protection legislation has to be respected here , but there must be a limit : we cannot hide behind data protection in cases of terrorism .
<en> In this respect it needs to be very clear .
<en> I believe and hope that in this way we can continue the fight against terrorism and thereby bring peace to this world .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , there is always a delicate balance to be drawn between civil liberties and security .
<en> Several times since the twin tower attacks nine years ago I think we have got that balance wrong .
<en> We have got it wrong because of a false equation in politics , whereby politicians think that their action needs to be in proportion to the extent of public outrage , rather than in proportion to the need to remedy an identified problem .
<en> This Chamber has made that mistake , but it has not been alone .
<en> National parliaments have done the same thing on both sides of the Atlantic .
<en> On this occasion , though , I believe we have got the balance right .
<en> We have taken our time , we have put in sensible safeguards , and I think that we are enabling the security forces of the world to collaborate effectively in the fight against terror without an unacceptable price in terms of civic freedom .
<en> This is exactly the kind of thing the European Union should concentrate on : a cross-border issue which cannot be left to the Member States .
<en> If it did this kind of thing all the time , the rest of us would not have such a problem .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am against the concept of 20 weeks at full pay and voted against that particular amendment .
<en> Nevertheless , I decided to vote in favour of the final text as amended because of the insertion of a clause that was negotiated by the PPE , allowing for a degree of flexibility during the last four weeks .
<en> I have thus decided to support my political group in the attainment of this compromise .
<sp>
<2en> I am pleased that the European Parliament has made progress on this matter since the debate on the demographic challenge for which I was the rapporteur in 2007 .
<2en> This vote proves that it is still possible these days to achieve new social acquis : with mobilisation and political action we can protect the achievements of past victories , but also obtain new rights .
<2en> Today , we have strengthened women 's rights , but also those of men , with this paternity leave .
<2en> The latter represents a real change in attitudes and , over the years , will contribute to improving the allocation of roles between parents .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Regarding Amendment 9 : UKIP voted in favour of this amendment which merely stated that ' All parents have the right to care for their child ' .
<en> UKIP by no means supports the legitimacy of this directive , as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies .
<en> However , the UK Government is far too cavalier in taking children into state care , so voting in favour of this recital will be a shot across their bow .
<en> Regarding the proposal in general : UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies .
<en> This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government , which we can ill afford at this time .
<en> This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are , especially for small businesses , which are the backbone of the UK economy .
<en> UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt .
<en> However , the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so .
<en> UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report because it is very important for gender equality and to the defence of the rights of workers - men and women - in terms of maternity and paternity rights .
<2en> This is an important step forward in defending and promoting women 's rights and equality in general in the workplace , given that , according to the report , ' the vulnerability of pregnant workers and of workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding makes it necessary for them to be granted the right to maternity leave of at least 20 continuous weeks , allocated before and / or after confinement , and renders necessary the compulsory nature of maternity leave of at least six weeks allocated after confinement ' .
<2en> I also voted in favour of the report on the basis of an additional , very important element in it : the recognition of the father 's right to two weeks ' paternity leave .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Regarding the proposal in general , UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies .
<en> This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government , which we can ill afford at this time .
<en> This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are , especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy .
<en> UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt .

<2en> This report has our support because it emphasises the strengthening of relations between the EU and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean .
<2en> The European Union 's specific task is to act as an economic and commercial player on the international stage , overcoming competition from its partners , the United States and China , which have a foothold in the Latin American market .
<2en> Few sectors benefit from these trade relations .
<2en> Eighty-five per cent of the imports into the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean ( LAC ) are industrial products , whereas 40 % of exports to the EU are commodities .
<2en> In the medium to long term , trade relations should be intensified in accordance with clear and transparent rules .
<sp>
<2en> The European Union is , first and foremost , an advocate of respect for human rights .
<2en> This is why I believe that we must focus very closely on respect for human rights in Colombia before liberalising trade with this country .
<2en> On the other hand , on the subject of food imports from Latin America , we must ensure that these countries comply with the same standards in terms of quality and animal protection which our own producers also comply with .
<sp>
<2en> European common trade policy is an integral and important part of the Union 's general external action .
<2en> It could play a very positive role in wealth-creation goals , and in economic and political relationships between the people and countries of Europe and Latin America .
<2en> I have no doubt that closer integration of the economic spheres could be a win-win situation for both parties , notably in terms of creating more and better jobs .
<2en> However , I know the effects that the bilateral trade agreements signed between the European Union and the countries of Latin America could have on the economies of the outermost regions .
<2en> In the region that I am from , Madeira , the consequences are particularly visible as regards banana production .
<2en> I therefore argue that this productive sector and the other strategic and traditional sectors of the outermost regions should be preserved .
<2en> To this end , and in accordance with the commitment made by the European Union to them , the outermost regions must be compensated adequately , with particular attention paid to their vulnerable economies .
<2en> There is provision in this report for such safeguards for these regions , so I voted for it .
<sp>

<en> in writing . - With this vote , Parliament has followed AFET 's position in welcoming the Commission 's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1717 / 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability , as part of a wider review of the external financial assistance of the EU .
<en> Among other things , AFET , and now Parliament as a whole , agrees that a revision of Article 3 ( 2 ) ( i ) and Article 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the original regulation are necessary in order to bring it into line with the ruling of the European Court of Justice of 20 May 2008 , which found that measures against the proliferation of small arms and light weapons may be implemented by the Community under its development policy .
<en> The Presidency , on behalf of the Council and along with the Commission and Parliament , is invited to develop a ' Declaration on a European Consensus in support of EU Action on SALW ' , which takes into account the respective competences of all institutions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the report on the financing instrument for development cooperation ( DCI ) because I believe that Parliament has closely monitored the way in which the DCI 's provisions have been implemented since it came into force in 2007 .
<en> In its legislative proposal for the mid-term review of the DCI , the Commission only suggested a technical amendment to allow the costs relating to taxes , duties and other charges related to the financing of the actions covered by the DCI in beneficiary countries to be financed from the DCI budget .
<en> I believe that this amendment will make it possible for these costs to be financed in exceptional circumstances , thus creating greater flexibility in the implementation of programmes and projects .
<sp>
<2en> I abstained from voting on this specific report , despite the fact that I agree and support the proposed amendments , especially those which restore the controlling role of the European Parliament .
<2en> I abstained in the final vote on the financing instrument for development cooperation , because the money has been used , directly or indirectly , to arm and train the police and the military in various areas of Africa .
<2en> In my opinion , financing for development should not , under any circumstances , be used for military or politico-military purposes .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) We are all aware that the Development Cooperation Instrument ( DCI ) does not provide for any exception to the principle of non-eligibility for Community financing .
<en> As a result , this allows a certain degree of flexibility on a case-by-case basis .
<en> The authorising officer can , if appropriate , decide to fund these costs to ensure the smooth running of the programmes and projects .
<en> However , this flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because tax exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical .
<en> In these situations , the rigid formulation of the DCI instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult .
<en> This is why I support the proposal to submit a request to the Commission to table legislative proposals for alignment with the RPS procedure and to ensure that this instrument complies with the new comitology requirements .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I am voting overall in favour of the proposal presented in this report .
<en> The financing instrument for development cooperation ( DCI ) improves the European Union 's previous development cooperation framework by combining the various geographical and thematic instruments into a single instrument .
<en> In conjunction with the technical amendments related to the financing of the actions covered by the DCI , which aim at greater flexibility in the implementation of their projects and programmes , the mid-term review of this instrument provides an ideal occasion for adapting the DCI comitology procedure to the new comitology requirements .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis .
<2en> The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or , following the 2009 amendment , on account of the economic crisis , in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
<2en> Today 's vote concerned a request for assistance for 598 workers made redundant by eight companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 58 ( publishing activities ) in the two NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland , amounting to a sum of EUR 2 326 459 financed by the EGF .
<2en> Lastly , I must emphasise that today 's adoption of the six reports shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome this report and the support the European Globalisation Fund is giving to workers made redundant .
<en> This proposal is for EUR 2 326 459 to assist 598 workers , from 8 enterprises in the printing and reproduction media , who are losing their jobs because of the economic crisis .
<en> This is an important example of European solidarity .
<sp>
<2en> The EU is an area of solidarity , and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is a part of that .
<2en> This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world .
<2en> An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries , particularly China and India , with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers ' rights .
<2en> The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses , and it is crucial in facilitating their access to new employment in the future .
<2en> The EGF has been used in the past by other EU countries , so it is now appropriate to provide aid to the Netherlands , which has submitted a request for assistance in respect of 598 redundancies in eight companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 58 ( publishing activities ) in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Noord Holland and Zuid Holland .
<sp>
<2en> During the nine-month reference period from 1 April 2009 to 29 December 2009 , there were 598 redundancies in a total of eight companies in Noord Holland and Zuid Holland .
<2en> Each one of these workers was a victim of globalisation .
<2en> The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) was established to cushion the impact of social injustices of this kind .
<2en> I have voted in favour of the report , because all the requirements for the mobilisation of the EGF have been met .
<sp>
<2en> Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund would benefit eight different enterprises and save 598 jobs .
<2en> I have therefore voted in favour of this report .

<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the signs look very promising for the EU-Africa summit .
<en> The summit will revolve entirely around an equal partnership for a better common future .
<en> Two months after the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York , we have the unique opportunity to take further specific , binding steps in the fight against poverty in Africa .
<en> We are , of course , following all of China 's extensive activities on the African continent to safeguard its own supply of raw materials with great concern .
<en> It is very much reminiscent of the behaviour of colonial states .
<en> The European Union must , therefore , press for a regulation that promotes the common good of , and social progress in , the African countries .
<en> That will create work that is sustainable .
<en> I therefore expressly welcome the Commission 's proposal to employ effective controls in the context of raw materials management .
<en> Together with the African partners , we need to support a structural policy that promotes growth and climate protection in order for the African people to escape from the poverty trap .
<en> We support the Commission 's proposals for social cohesion , because they will help to create jobs .
<en> We must put the people of Africa in a position where they can achieve the goal of earning a living wage through their own work .
<en> Finally , I would like to provide a summary of the following priorities .
<en> Firstly , we need to strengthen the African Union and its representations in all international bodies - the Security Council , G20 and the Pan-African Parliament .
<en> The Millennium Goals must be achieved in Africa by 2015 by means of further initiatives .
<en> We must ensure that the social standards stipulated by the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) are laid down and made binding in any economic and trade agreements between the EU and Africa .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , the Action Plan for the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership includes a section on democratic governance and human rights , which are regarded as ' key for sustainable development ' .
<en> However , we have been very poor at implementing such objectives .
<en> A prime example has been the failure to bring about real change in Zimbabwe .
<en> In 2007 , in the lead-up to the first EU-Africa summit , we complained bitterly about the EU 's hypocrisy in imposing a travel ban and asset freeze on Mugabe and his ilk with one hand , while inviting him to a summit in a European capital - Lisbon - with the other .
<en> Now we find that Mugabe is yet again invited to an EU-Africa summit , albeit in Libya , and we meekly trot along as if none of this mattered .
<en> To rub shoulders with Mugabe is an affront to our principles and is in direct contradiction to the EU 's own , stated position .
<en> It is a failure of our diplomacy in Africa that any African government still has any regard for Mugabe .
<en> Madam President , may I put two questions to the Council and the Commission ?
<en> In Libya , will EU representatives voice their disapproval of Mugabe 's presence ?
<en> Secondly , what is the EU doing to actively promote good governance ?
<en> Without it , there is little hope for a prosperous , democratic future for Africa .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , in just a few weeks the European Union has played a leading role in a large number of summits , beginning with China , then Asia , the United States and the G20 .
<en> Soon we will go to Cancún and next week to the EU-Africa Summit .
<en> We could see this as being simply a question of our schedule , a routine succession of summits that we encounter every year or every so often .
<en> We could , however , see it as being a series of summits in which we need to move forward on the issues , in which we need to introduce the necessary reforms in order to face up to a world that is changing in terms of its problems , its responses and its players .
<en> This is how we must see the forthcoming EU-Africa Summit .
<en> There are 80 countries meeting together , representing a third of the United Nations countries and 1.5 billion inhabitants , which is one in every four .
<en> Unfortunately , we cannot say that we have the same proportional gross domestic product , as the 53 African countries include some of the poorest countries in the world .
<en> What do we need to do in order to improve the action that we are taking ?
<en> Firstly , we need to focus our priorities on more infrastructure , greater food security and more support for governability .
<en> Secondly , we need to focus our aid instruments , support civil society , support private initiative and strengthen the role of the European Parliament and of the Pan-African Parliament .
<en> Finally we need to unite with Africa in a series of strategic relationships , for example , regarding international financial institutions .
<en> The reform of the World Bank has given greater powers to the emerging countries , but it has taken power away from Africa .
<en> The President of the World Bank said in April that now the concept of the ' third world ' has been consigned to the history books .
<en> Unfortunately that is not the case , but we can do something to ensure that it becomes a reality in the near future .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all we must remember that Africa is the tenth world power , even in a year in which we remember an important issue - poverty - which certainly affects Africa as it affects many other continents .
<en> We need to strengthen the association agreements and take action for economic sustainability , particularly through infrastructure , education , health and water resources , with real controls on the adequacy of the financial measures decided upon for African countries , remembering that Africa varies greatly from region to region .
<en> There are regions with particular needs , which often give rise to flows of illegal immigrants , for example .
<en> Instead , we need to adapt migratory flows to the effective needs of the labour market .
<en> A constructive dialogue can certainly protect fundamental rights and support governance in this extremely important continent .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , at the upcoming EU-Africa summit in Libya , EU leaders will face Meles Zenawi , the prime minister of Ethiopia .
<en> Ethiopia is not only the second most populous country in Africa and the headquarters of the African Union , it is also the partner - in terms of the Cotonou Agreement - which has prevented the delivery of the EU election report in Addis Ababa in 2005 , and more recently in 2010 , in order to avoid exposing the irregularities and the manipulation of the elections .
<en> What good is the talk of democracy , human rights and good governance , which the EU is going to have with African interlocutors , if Meles Zenawi , the dictator of Ethiopia , is the interlocutor for Africa ?
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , somewhat by way of a complement to what the Commission has just told us and by way of a conclusion , I should like to tell you that the third European Union-Africa summit in Tripoli must send an important political signal aimed at deepening our cooperation with Africa in the years to come .
<2en> It will be about better cooperation on the challenges faced by the two continents , about better exploitation of the possibilities offered by the combination of their enormous potential and about better coordination of our positions on the international stage .
<2en> African and European leaders will not fail to find pointers for the road to follow .
<2en> In this debate , we have heard a number of specific pointers , which we shall obviously not fail to pass on .
<2en> All contributions , particularly those made by parliamentarians , are welcome .
<2en> I should also like to reply to one question in particular .
<2en> A number of you have specifically mentioned the economic partnership agreements which , it is true , are a sensitive issue , and which were already a significant cause of disagreement at the 2007 Lisbon summit .
<2en> Given the strong reluctance on the part of Africa to conclude economic partnership agreements , it is true that certain players have asked for a political signal that we are taking account of the African position ; others argue for a much more proactive and positive approach on the nature of our proposals .
<2en> At the summit , our genuine feeling is that it will be best as far as this issue is concerned to look for an agreement to reopen these negotiations in any case .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place during the next part-session in December .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 149 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The Africa-EU strategic partnership established in 2007 at the Lisbon Summit allowed the two continents to define common interests and strategic objectives , going beyond traditional EU development policy .
<en> The objectives outlined were put into practice with the adoption of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy and the 2008-2010 action plan which sets out eight priority areas : peace and security ; democratic governance and human rights ; trade , regional integration and infrastructure , the millennium development goals , energy , climate change , migration , mobility and employment , science , information society and space .
<en> The third Africa-EU Summit , to take place in Tripoli , the capital of Libya , will have ' Investment , economic growth and job creation ' as its theme , with the aim of outlining long-term joint guidelines in these areas , while safeguarding the priorities set out in the EU 2020 strategy .
<en> I believe that this is an opportunity for Portuguese traders to make closer connections in the African market as part of their business networks , but the issues of insecurity and the high levels of crime perpetrated by the Portuguese community , particularly the Madeiran Community resident in South Africa , must nevertheless be addressed .
<en> It is therefore vital to strengthen and develop concrete and concerted cooperation , and simultaneously adapt it to new challenges in international relations .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Parliament , after having acquitted itself well in the negotiations with the Council on the 2011 budget , on the conditions for the drawing up of the next multiannual financial framework and the question of the Union 's own resources , has lost the battle .
<2en> By adopting the 2011 budget , during the December part-session , we showed the Council was right .
<2en> Our concerns were not about figures but rather about political demands .
<2en> We have not forgotten our seven demands adopted during the previous part-session .
<2en> The positive thing is that the Commission will also present a proposal in the spring of 2011 on the question of own resources .
<2en> Parliament will be included in these discussions as it will in those needed for producing financial perspectives .
<2en> But the terms remain to be defined , and therefore the fight for codecision to be respected in this area has only just begun .
<sp>
<2en> The adoption of the EU 's 2011 budget by Parliament indicates that when dialogue is established between the Commission and the legislative , matters can be arranged for their mutual benefit .
<2en> The Commission has realised that the European Parliament now has a greater say in the Union 's finances , and has decided , albeit later on , to respect this situation .
<2en> In practical terms , the budget remains within the limits set by the Council but , at the same time , it also includes some of the legislative 's priorities .
<2en> Before agreement was reached , we were in the odd situation of having all kinds of strategies and programmes which did not feature at all in the budget forecasts for next year .
<2en> These strategies and programmes cannot just remain on paper because they would only serve to highlight inconsistency and a lack of confidence in the acts adopted by the European Union itself .
<2en> It is obvious that you cannot develop programmes supporting young people , innovation and research and you cannot claim to be an active player in global foreign policy without the funds designed to finance all these plans .
<2en> Parliament has argued successfully with the Council for the need to carry out regular evaluations of the benefits of new legislation and its funding .
<2en> As representatives elected directly by the European Union 's citizens , it is important for taxpayers to see that their money is being well spent .
<sp>
<2en> I am pleased with the budget approved today , as it retains the priority lines adopted by Parliament in October , which strengthen key areas such as education , youth , research and innovation .
<2en> It is essential to provide the EU with a sustainable budget that may be implemented in a full and foreseeable manner from the start of the financial year , in contrast to a system of provisional twelfths that would put the implementation of its policies at risk .
<2en> It is equally important to strive for a budget that is visionary in times of crisis and which strengthens areas that contribute to economic growth and to more and better jobs , such as science and innovation .
<2en> Only through an ambitious budget will economic recovery be possible in Europe .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The 2011 budget was voted with responsibility , bitterness and conviction .
<en> Responsibility : the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and Parliament assumed their responsibility by voting in favour of this budget to avoid an institutional impasse and recourse to the provisional twelfths system .
<en> Bitterness : codecision in budgetary matters is a losing battle .
<en> Despite the concessions made by Parliament , some Member States who , unlike me , do not believe in the added value of the European budget , have remained inflexible .
<en> Conviction : the future of the Union depends on new own resources and a tax on financial transactions .
<en> We need the Commission and we need it to be committed to this , if we are to make this fundamental objective a reality .
<en> We need a Trade and Transport Facilitation ( TTF ) , and also a 2011 budget and therefore I abstained on the amendment retabled by the Greens on this issue , which was symbolic but irresponsible .
<en> The TTF is a topic which is too important to be trifled with , within the political strategies of tabling amendments for which one is not the original author , with a budget line at zero .
<en> What was originally a socialist amendment was intended to move this debate forward during the budgetary procedure , but had it been adopted today it would have meant choosing a Union with no budget .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of a budget with a near zero increase on 2010 , to show that Parliament could display maturity and responsibility in the context of an economic crisis that is crippling national governments .
<2en> It is not right to start increasing the 2011 budget at a time when most Member States are entering a period of tight budgetary control .
<2en> I am delighted that the tough negotiations that took place between the various institutions on this matter led to a compromise and that we have avoided budgetary crisis for 2011 .

<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , today is the moment of truth for us when it comes to solidarity with Belarus .
<en> As we are all aware , Belarus is the last dictatorship in Europe , and we should show our full solidarity .
<en> As we are also all aware , the US is providing only limited funds in this area , and the proposal which we would like to put forward today is a very significant programme of funding aimed at supporting both the opposition , the media and non-governmental organisations , but also , and above all , the young elite .
<en> I am talking here primarily about the hundreds or even thousands of Belarusian students who are currently unable to continue their studies , and I would like to make a very specific proposal , namely , that a special Erasmus programme be prepared , within the already functioning Erasmus system , targeted exclusively at Belarusian students .
<en> We know that we can make huge savings by using this programme , and that it will not require much effort , but the creation of a modern young future for a democratic state may prove effective in the long term , and I would ask the Commissioner to ensure that this is the case .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I very much wish to thank you and all the honourable Members who have participated in this very important , focused and well-considered debate today .
<en> I will , of course , study Parliament 's resolution on this important and challenging issue .
<en> It is now still only a month since this crisis began , and events move quickly .
<en> My hope is , of course , that they will now move in a positive direction , in line with the goals that we all share .
<en> The detainees should be released and Belarus should lay the foundations to embark on an inclusive reform process .
<en> I stress my hope that parliamentary cooperation will continue to have an important role to play in that process .
<en> Many honourable Members have endorsed the ideas that I set out in the beginning : the need to be absolutely clear about the unacceptability of what has happened , to be clear that we wish to take steps on this , and to be clear that we wish to support civil society , young people , the media and students - the categories that many honourable Members have talked about .
<en> I will take great heart from the comments that have been made .
<en> We will now move forward to make sure that we do this .
<en> Finally , when I met the families and the opposition leaders who came to meet with me , I was absolutely clear with them that we expected to see people released from prison and Belarus move forward , in the way that we would all wish , towards real democracy .
<en> I also made very direct comments to the Foreign Minister .
<en> It is in their hands to reverse their position and to do what they know that they must .
<en> If they do not , then the international community will and must act .
<sp>
<en> I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 110 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Thursday , 20 January 2011 .
<en> Madam Vice-President / High Representative , I understand that you have been in the Chamber since 15 : 00 and now it is 18 : 15 .
<en> Would you like us to take a five-minute break just to relax ?
<en> It is up to you , otherwise we can keep going .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Council / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Mr President , I have to leave to start travelling to Turkey for the talks with Iran , so my dear colleague and friend , Stefan Füle , will take the last part of this debate .
<sp>
<2en> The situation in Belarus is extremely worrying and the EU needs to take appropriate steps .
<2en> In this respect , I would like to tell you about a conspiracy theory that is circulating , told to me yesterday by a Belarusian businessman .
<2en> He claimed that this situation is not what President Lukashenko himself wanted after the elections but that it was a result of collaboration between the Belarusian and Russian secret services aimed at undermining any attempt at cooperation between the EU and Belarus .
<2en> Of course , it is impossible to prove theories such as this , but we should nonetheless consider the fact that by imposing sanctions on the Belarusian parties responsible , we may also be harming Belarusian citizens , civil society and so on .
<2en> Considering the likely , albeit silent , involvement of Russia in this situation , I would like to repeat something I have already said to this House before : Ceterum censeo , France decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia , and I am convinced that it will regret its action .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> On the issue of the report on competition policy for 2009 , I would like to reiterate the importance of the follow-up actions to assess the effectiveness of the State aid provided .
<2en> It is vital for the European single market that the Commission conduct an in-depth analysis of the consequences of the review of the state assistance mechanism carried out in response to the crisis , and with regard to healthy competition and ensuring a level playing field in the EU , financial reform and job creation .
<2en> We must not forget that the process of reviewing the mechanisms for providing state assistance was initiated for one purpose only : to help the Member States ' economies recover from the crisis .
<2en> By monitoring the outcomes of the provision of state assistance , the Commission must satisfy itself that the measures taken do not exceed the initial aim , because the essence of EU competition policy is equal participation in the single market .
<sp>
<2en> We have voted on a crucially important document on EU competition policy .
<2en> Competition is essential for the healthy functioning of the economy .
<2en> Competition should be looked at worldwide as well as inside the Union .
<2en> In the worldwide approach , we have to concentrate , among other things , on the rules of play in the market , and also at the cost side of competitive producers from outside the European Union .
<2en> This concerns Chinese and Korean producers in particular .
<2en> I welcome the call for completion of the single railway market throughout Europe .
<2en> Healthy principles of competition can contribute to revitalisation of the railways and increase their share of the transport market .
<2en> This may bring us closer to the idea of a European railway system , similar to the road or aviation system .
<sp>
<2en> The year 2009 was a difficult year for the European Union , marked by the especially serious financial and economic crisis , and it was not alone in this .
<2en> The negative effects of this crisis hit the economy and business environment hard , as well as decision makers .
<2en> While decision makers have tried to draw up policies that will minimise the impact of the crisis on the real economy , the European Commission , together with Member States and central banks , has worked hard to stabilise the financial system .
<2en> This year 's report pays particular attention to these issues and notes with satisfaction the rapid response from the Commission and its successful application of competition policy measures .
<2en> I voted in favour of this report as I think that the European Union needs a strong competition policy , founded on the principle of a free market and fair competition in all sectors , which will generate a successful internal market and will favour the creation of sustainable , knowledge-based jobs .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this Report and particularly want to draw attention to paragraph 105 which calls on the Commission to seek the completion of the single railway market .
<en> A call I strongly endorse .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because , based on a positive evaluation of the action taken by the European Commission again this year , it strongly supports a more active role for Parliament in the shaping of competition policy .
<2en> We are therefore asking for a ' colegislative ' role and for Parliament to be regularly informed of any initiatives in this field .
<2en> We wish to emphasise that an EU competition policy based on the principles of open markets and a level playing field in all sectors is a cornerstone of a successful internal market and a precondition for the creation of sustainable jobs .
<2en> We therefore underline our call for greater consistency between all EU policies and the priorities set out in the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs .
<2en> It is necessary to draft clearer competition rules that encourage the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises , which are a driver of growth in all our economies .
<2en> At the same time , we call on the Member States to cooperate actively with the Commission in developing and evaluating the temporary rules established in response to the financial and economic crisis by providing accurate , detailed reports on their implementation and effectiveness .

<en> I would like to pass on five pieces of news by way of preliminary remarks .
<en> I would firstly like to touch on the situation in the Mediterranean , which , as we all know , is changing very rapidly .
<en> The European Parliament was and is ready to lend its support to democratic changes initiated by the citizens themselves , who are our European neighbours .
<en> When we hold our debate today on Tunisia , we will be discussing a partner country which has already taken the first steps on the path towards true democracy .
<en> Just a short while ago , I met the Tunisian Foreign Affairs Minister , and I was accompanied by five other Members of the European Parliament .
<en> The situation in Egypt is different , and it is less certain which direction is being taken by the changes , which are already irreversible .
<en> These changes must not lose their momentum , however .
<en> Both countries have one thing in common : all the democratic forces urgently need to make every effort to undertake political reforms , and subsequently economic and social reforms .
<en> They also need to lay the groundwork for free and democratic elections , so that the people 's demands for democracy do not go unanswered .
<en> We must also make it known - and we will do this during this part-session , both today and tomorrow during voting time - that democracy in neighbouring countries is just as important to the European Union as their stability .
<en> There is no choice between democracy and stability ; both are imperative .
<en> The second matter is that 20 January 2011 was the 20th anniversary of the Latvian ' Bloody Sunday ' , as the day is historically known .
<en> On this day , the pro-Soviet OMON units attacked strategic buildings in the capital of the newly-reborn state .
<en> Seven people lost their lives on the barricades defending Latvian independence , and many were injured .
<en> On 29 January 2011 , after a trial which was an affront to international standards , the Dutch and therefore EU citizen Zahra Bahrami was hanged in Iran .
<en> I would call on the Iranian authorities to clarify the charges made against Mrs Bahrami , and the opaque judicial procedure .
<en> The European Union holds the position that the death penalty can never be regarded as an act of justice .
<en> On 26 January 2011 , David Kato , a defender of human rights and civil rights activist , was murdered in Uganda .
<en> I would call on the Ugandan authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of this crime .
<en> We all deplore the fact that homosexuality continues to be regarded as a crime in this country .
<en> Finally , my last piece of news : in connection with today 's debate on preparation for the European Council on 4 February , I would like to inform you that on 8 February , or in other words next week , a meeting of the Conference of Presidents will take place that is open to all Members of Parliament .
<en> Mr Van Rompuy , President of the European Council , will be a guest at this special meeting , when he will present the conclusions of Friday 's summit in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon , which states that the President shall report on such matters to us .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I hope that the House and you will allow me this short indulgence to congratulate you on the statement you have made on behalf of David Kato who was murdered in Uganda .
<en> He was , as you said , a human rights defender and he defended the rights of lesbian , gay and bisexual people .
<en> I just wanted to say that here in this House we have passed a motion on what is happening in Uganda .
<en> It is vital that we support Ugandan civil society and remember that David was a giant who stood above those who preached hatred and discrimination , and we should remember his family at this sad time .
<sp>
<en> Thank you .

<2en> The waste crisis afflicting Campania and other regions of Italy illustrates the danger of having our environment managed by companies that are driven solely by profit .
<2en> This is even more true when those companies are aided by governments that protect their interests .
<2en> The underworld , contemptible as it is , is profiting from the loopholes created by this system without anyone standing in its way .
<2en> Meanwhile , it is the people and our entire ecosystem that are paying the price for the Eurocrats ' complicit silence .
<sp>
<2en> The waste crisis in Campania has been unsustainable for a number of years and goes against the rules adopted by all EU Member States .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to quickly implement a waste management plan under which , in accordance with Directive 2008 / 98 / EC , respect for the waste cycle hierarchy is fundamental .
<2en> The European Parliament must be kept informed of how the situation develops , especially regarding the implementation of a waste management plan , pursuant to the 4 March 2010 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union and to EU legislation .
<sp>
<en> in writing.- ( HU ) The waste crisis afflicting the province of Campania has caused serious problems in Italy recently .
<en> Consequently , the observation of EU legislation on waste management must be strictly enforced in the region .
<en> I believe it is regrettable that the authorities have taken violent action against people peacefully demonstrating against the opening of new landfills .
<en> The Italian authorities must ensure that all the necessary measures are taken to guarantee that waste is properly collected , separated and treated .
<en> In my opinion it is not taxpayers who should pay for cleaning the polluted area but , applying the principle of the ' polluter pays ' , those who caused the pollution .
<en> However , a sustainable solution to the problem can only be found through the active involvement of citizens in the entire process .
<en> I oppose , however , politicising the matter and using it as an excuse to attack the Italian Government .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this motion for a resolution because I agree that a solution should be decided on urgently that is sustainable and respects EU rules , with the application of a waste management plan under which respect for the waste cycle hierarchy is fundamental .
<2en> As a member of the Committee on Petitions , I have dealt with numerous petitions on the waste crisis and the counterproductive measures employed by the Italian authorities .
<2en> I am pleased that Parliament has adopted this resolution which , as well as being an important step towards solving the specific problem in Italy , is a mechanism for strengthening European legislation and preventing similar controversies in the future .
<2en> I welcome the regret expressed in the resolution at the Italian authorities ' treatment of their citizens who made use of their rights to demonstrate peacefully , with violence even being employed in some cases .
<2en> I also believe that the call on the Commission to amend the necessary directives in order to ban the locating of landfills in protected natural areas , natural parks , Natura 2000 sites and United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation heritage areas , or the expansion of existing ones into such areas , is of great benefit .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I abstained on the resolution .
<en> I would like to add that this is not a political but a technical issue .
<en> It is strange that Members of European Parliament have to make an appeal for solving purely household issues .
<en> If the trend continues in the same way , then it is possible that the EU will call on the public to stop swearing , smoking , drinking , sunbathing , eating unhealthy food and sleeping for a long time .
<en> The fire brigade will be asked to extinguish fires faster ; medical personnel will be asked to treat people more attentively ; policemen will be asked to arrest criminals more effectively and teachers to teach children better .
<en> If we carry on making such calls , the citizens of the EU will wonder why they need the European Parliament - to ask citizens to do things ?
<en> Or there are real problems to be solved ?

<en> ( NL ) Mr President , the Netherlands is once again having to clean up Greece 's mess !
<en> First , Dutch taxpayers had to pay billions of euro to bail out this nearly bankrupt country , and now we are saddled with two thousand asylum seekers from Greece whom we are not allowed to send back .
<en> The Netherlands does not want those asylum seekers .
<en> The Netherlands has suffered enough , and continues to suffer , from mass immigration and the failed multicultural experiment .
<en> The Netherlands wants fewer immigrants who have no prospects and Europe has to start pursuing a much more stringent immigration policy .
<en> Otherwise , Europe will end up becoming Eurabia .
<en> However , Greece is also the victim of its bad neighbour , Turkey .
<en> Greece should therefore build a wall to keep out Turkish emigrants and emigrants which Turkey is allowing to transit its territory .
<en> We should punish Turkey , of course , for providing illegal immigrants with a passage to Greece .
<en> Finally , the European asylum legislation should be a great deal more stringent .
<en> Let us be honest : 99 % of asylum seekers are , in fact , not asylum seekers at all , but economic fortune seekers abusing our asylum laws .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I shall continue the debate with the following hypothesis : we have seen the unrest in the Mediterranean and Arab countries .
<en> We know that many citizens of these countries hope to find a better fate in Europe .
<en> This is already a fact of life and I fear that the hypothesis I am about to develop will soon become another fact of life .
<en> Citizens leave these third countries for Europe .
<en> They arrive in Lampedusa - we have seen the problems that have arisen there - or try to reach Greece via Turkey , exploiting the facility not to apply for a visa based on the agreements which many of these third countries have with Turkey .
<en> Others go to Malta , some probably go to Portugal and Spain .
<en> Then some of them apply for asylum .
<en> It goes without saying that here again , Dublin II will be applied .
<en> We know that , even though some asylum seekers then appeal on these issues , again there will be convictions , just as we have had to date , by national courts , before we even get to a European Court ruling .
<en> So let us not pretend otherwise .
<en> Then there is this : some are arrested and will not be entitled to asylum .
<en> I am sure you know that , based on the agreement on which the Commission has just announced the end of negotiations , in order for those who enter via Turkey to be returned to Turkey under readmission , we will need to wait two years for the agreement to apply plus three years , which is the transitional period for third country nationals , giving a total of five years .
<en> In other words , those arrested during that period , based on the crisis we are facing , will need to wait until 2016 or 2017 for Turkey to take them back .
<en> Allow me to say that , with this sort of management , I fear that Europe is not up to the job at the moment .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , I think that it is always useful to remind ourselves of a number of commitments , and particularly the one made in October 2008 , via the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum , which announced that it was time to take new initiatives to complete the introduction of a common European asylum system , and thus to offer a higher level of protection within the European Union .
<en> More than two years after this promise , the Commission 's proposals are on the negotiating table .
<en> One cannot help but notice , however , that this European asylum system and the harmonisation process are struggling somewhat to see the light of day .
<en> The recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights is an important turning point , in my opinion .
<en> Obviously , it highlights the failures of the Greek asylum system , but it also sends a strong message at a time when Greece is starting to reform its asylum system and , at the same time , to take other types of initiatives .
<en> Aside from this particular situation , however , this decision more generally calls into question the European asylum system as a whole , particularly regarding one of its fundamental components - the Dublin regulation - and its main premise , the equivalence of national asylum systems within the Union .
<en> This decision shows how , paradoxically , the common European asylum system has created a kind of injustice , both for asylum seekers and for the Member States .
<en> Following this decision , clear measures are now needed immediately .
<en> Pending an operational asylum system in Greece , the Member States must suspend returning asylum seekers to Greece and use the sovereignty clause of this regulation which allows them to take responsibility for examining an application .
<en> The European Court of Human Rights ' ( ECHR ) decision also sends a signal to all parties concerned .
<en> I think that this decision should serve as a catalyst in the process of harmonisation and redrafting , in particular , when it comes to the Dublin regulation .
<en> First of all , this is , of course , about the mechanism for suspending transfers that I have just mentioned , which is being proposed by the Commission .
<en> The ECHR 's decision sheds new light on this mechanism , on the one hand , and on intra-European solidarity , on the other .
<en> The suspension should restart discussions on the need for a suspension mechanism , as I mentioned , under conditions which are clearly specified .
<en> Secondly , aside from this mechanism , the suspension must also serve as a lever - or at least , I hope it will - to provide support , during the negotiations , for the other amendments to the regulation that are being proposed by the Commission , as well as those on the guarantees given in this instrument , among others .
<en> Finally , the suspension by the ECHR should allow us to start thinking about the inherent vulnerability of the situation that asylum seekers find themselves in .
<en> It should also make it necessary to bring in an appeal mechanism to suspend transfer of asylum seekers who are subject to a transfer decision resulting from the application of the Dublin regulation .
<en> Today , many of the warning lights are red ; they are telling us that it is time to reform this regulation and to construct a true common asylum system founded on solidarity and responsibility .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Malmström , we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights .
<en> This is ultimately about Belgium , but it concerns every Member State of the European Union .
<en> Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece .
<en> As one of my fellow Members has mentioned , we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum , something which I , as a Liberal , strongly support .
<en> However , this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process .
<en> We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone .
<en> Because of their geographical position , these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees .
<en> In Lampedusa , this is because of current events in Tunisia .
<en> However , this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with .
<en> The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago .
<en> We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly .
<en> Therefore , if we really want to retain this right to asylum , we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future .
<en> Dublin II cannot continue in its current form .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Afghan citizen referred to in the judgment of the Court of Human Rights was not an immigrant , was not abusing the system and was not a victim of human trafficking .
<en> Moreover , he was not covered by the Geneva Convention because he was not persecuted .
<en> He was an asylum seeker , so he would have had subsidiary protection and international protection .
<en> The judgment is therefore important due to the precedent that it sets .
<en> How many people could be awaiting judgments having appealed against denied asylum applications ?
<en> How many people could apply for compensation due to delays in proceedings ?
<en> What would happen if there were more than a thousand judgments by the Court of Human Rights against Member States ?
<en> What would happen to Europe 's reputation ?
<en> Can we continue to consider ourselves to be champions of fundamental rights if we treat asylum seekers who are fleeing wars worse than if they were criminals ?
<en> Commissioner , asylum seekers can be awaiting proceedings in detention centres - if they are refugees or receiving subsidiary protection - for up to seven months , with no procedural rights .
<en> Is this humane ?
<en> The asylum package has been stalled for too long , and the common asylum system does not exist , Mr Weber .
<en> Nor do all the Member States have the same procedures .
<en> There is a lack of solidarity , which is the cause of the situation that we are experiencing .
<en> The Afghan citizen was compensated for non-material damage , not based on the Dublin regulation , but how much compensation can be applied for due to non-material damage by those fleeing wars who spend years going back and forth between camps ?
<en> We are tired of talking about abuse and traffickers .
<en> Will it not be the case that we want to look the other way and deny the existence of a situation that we seek to deny time and time again ?
<en> Dublin can indeed be perfected , but a great deal more needs to be done .
<en> This is urgent , Commissioner .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The H1N1 influenza was extremely instructive .
<2en> First , it taught us how to throw money down the drain .
<2en> The cost of this ' swine ' influenza ( EUR 900 million according to the Court of Auditors ! ) is not due to the number of victims .
<2en> There were 10 times fewer H1N1 influenza victims than victims of ordinary seasonal influenza .
<2en> Yet it is true that those 2 000 annual victims , most of whom were elderly or already ill , are of no interest to anyone .
<2en> They are much less exotic .
<2en> Next , it taught us how to completely disguise a lack of judgment with alarmist speeches and arm waving .
<2en> Tens of millions of doses were ordered unnecessarily .
<2en> We had what was meant to be a mass vaccination programme organised without any regard for common sense .
<2en> The communication was so exaggerated and contradictory that the people of France turned their backs with suspicion , and rightly so , on the orders that were given to them .
<2en> There was a suspicion of common interest between those who took the political decisions and those who benefited from them financially .
<2en> Finally , the H1NI influenza taught us that , in France , however error-prone , negligent or incompetent a minister , nothing would force him or her to resign .
<2en> And the daily events within the French Government are proof that , on this matter , nothing , absolutely nothing , has changed !
<sp>
<2en> There was a lack of transparency in 2009 and 2010 in the way in which we dealt with the H1N1 strain of influenza , designated by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic .
<2en> This is dealt with in the ' Report on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU ' .
<2en> I welcome this report particularly because it provides for complete transparency in relation to the medicines used in the event of urgent medical intervention and a pandemic .
<2en> The Member States acted unilaterally in ordering and deploying vaccines .
<2en> The important issue in this context is to evaluate the strategy for stockpiling vaccines and to work towards the joint procurement of the vaccines by the Member States in future .
<2en> Improved coordination between the responsible authorities in the Member States and the European agencies is also important .
<sp>
<2en> Thanks to the amendments tabled by my political group ( the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) ) , this report contains constructive proposals to help us learn from the health crisis caused by the H1N1 virus , notably , by enhancing European coordination .
<2en> Indeed , the initial report contained a number of inaccuracies and could have discouraged people from having the inoculation .
<2en> However , the report as adopted today seeks to restore the confidence of our fellow citizens in health crisis management .
<2en> Health professionals will need to be more involved in drawing up and implementing a strategy for preventing and combating a pandemic .
<2en> We can no longer allow such confusion and suspicion to surround immunisation campaigns .
<2en> It will be essential to improve communication by taking into account how easy it is for rumours with no scientific basis to circulate on new media and the Internet .
<2en> Fortunately , the influenza was less serious than anticipated , but it would be dangerous to underestimate the degree of unpredictability and potential severity of future pandemics .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because the World Heath Organisation should urgently revise its definition to include the severity of a disease in its definitions on the stages of a pandemic to allow for more appropriate responses .
<2en> Better cooperation is needed in the response to pandemics .
<2en> There must be a review of prevention plans , a clarification and , if necessary , review of the roles and responsibilities of key actors , and reinforced cooperation between Member States in order to ensure coherent risk management in response to a pandemic in compliance with the International Health Regulation , as well as more serious coordination on the part of Member States with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control .
<2en> A procedure must be introduced enabling the Member States to make group purchases on a voluntary basis .
<2en> Manufacturers have to bear full liability for the authorised indications of their products , and this should be fully applied by Member States in all contracts for the procurement of vaccines .
<2en> The prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics must be revised in order to be more effective , coherent and sufficiently autonomous and flexible to be adapted as swiftly as possible , and on a case-by-case basis , to the actual risk , based on up-to date relevant information .
<2en> I agree with the opinion that vaccination strategies should rely on three conditions to be successful : efficacy of the vaccine , a positive benefit-risk balance for the vaccine , and targeting of risk groups .
<sp>
<2en> I believe the resolution on evaluation of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 in the EU clearly reveals the mistakes made and , at the same time , lays the foundations for fresh , effective management of influenza pandemics .
<2en> It is well known that the reaction to the spread of H1N1 influenza was exaggerated in comparison to the real scale of the problem .
<2en> Precisely for that reason , I believe that Europe 's influenza pandemic prevention plans need to be reviewed in order to provide rapid , consistent and effective responses .
<2en> In that respect , it is essential , in my view , to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the Member States in order to arrive at a truly European strategic approach to the problem .
<2en> Furthermore , I believe it would be useful , as mentioned in the text of the resolution , for independent scientific experts not linked to the pharmaceutical industry by any kind of interest to be involved in that process , alongside operators from the pharmaceutical sector .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the report , as it does not guarantee that a tax on financial transactions would be used for the purpose for which a true Tobin tax should be used , namely , developing countries and investments in the climate .
<2en> The report is unclear about whether the tax will accrue to the EU 's budgets , which opens up the possibility of more problems .
<2en> Firstly , I am fundamentally opposed to increasing the EU 's own resources .
<2en> Secondly , we will be wasting an opportunity to have a genuine Tobin tax if the EU has the right of disposal of the tax - see the Commission 's proposal that the tax should finance EU projects and gaps in the EU budget .
<2en> My vote should not be construed as opposition to a tax on financial transactions in the EU .
<2en> I fully support a genuine Tobin tax .
<2en> I also support the positive elements of the report , such as the fight against tax fraud , the ' polluter pays ' principle and the call for energy efficiency .
<sp>
<2en> Today , I once again voted in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) and agreed that , if we fail to impose an FTT at a global level , the EU should take the first step , anyway .
<2en> We have to take advantage of this momentum and restrain the greed of the financial and banking sectors .
<2en> After all , a global crisis requires global solutions and Europe , as the largest financial market , can play a pioneering role in this regard .
<2en> A financial transaction tax could provide Member States with sufficient revenue to balance their budgets and keep their economies going .
<2en> Because the revenue potential of an FTT of 0.05 % amounts to nearly EUR 200 billion in the EU and USD 650 billion globally , this tax could also form an important part of the solution in the search for new and sustainable sources of income .
<2en> An FTT could limit speculation and stabilise markets , create incentives for long-term investments and , because each transaction is traceable , it could increase transparency and ensure that financial players accept their share of the cost of the crisis .
<2en> Moreover , the report calls for the possibilities of issuing Eurobonds and imposing a CO2 tax to be examined in greater detail .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - In contrast to my Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal colleagues , I have supported this report which addresses a variety of possible financing sources including a Financial Transactions Tax .
<en> It also calls for a debate on the use of revenue which could come from a FTT .
<sp>
<2en> I strongly supported the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at global level during the vote on the report on innovative financing at global and European level .
<2en> However , the possibility of applying such a tax exclusively at European level should first be the subject of a feasibility study by the European Commission .
<2en> Indeed , we should establish whether this tax could be implemented at European level without having adverse effects on European competitiveness internationally .
<sp>
<2en> The economic and financial crisis has revealed serious deficiencies in the regulatory and supervisory framework of the global financial system .
<2en> Responses need to be provided to the crisis through new instruments that can put a brake on speculation , restore the role of the financial sector , ensure an equitable distribution of the burdens , and create new , additional resources for facing global challenges , such as climate change , development goals and intelligent , sustainable , inclusive growth within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> This own-initiative report is the result of a desire to find new , innovative sources of financing .
<2en> Taxation instruments based on the receipt of income are not considered to be sufficient .
<2en> The document examines the following possibilities for innovative financing : taxation of the financial sector , Eurobonds and taxation of the energy sector .
<2en> In my view , it is essential to innovate in terms of alternative means of financing that are equal to today 's challenges and in line with the modern world , but it is inadvisable to do this without first studying its real impact .
<2en> Just as important as increasing income is bolstering the regulatory role of the market , creating mechanisms to strengthen its transparency , efficiency and stability .
<2en> For these reasons , I voted in favour of the document during the plenary session .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The Haüsling report was a good one .
<2en> Increasing the protein independence of the Union , promoting shorter supply routes and helping farmers contributing to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are all measures that I support .
<2en> However , the pro-GMO lobbies and their representatives have succeeded in converting this report into a plea for allowing contaminated food to enter Europe .
<2en> The report also advocates a return to animal meal , with all the risks that it involves .
<2en> It is time to relocate the production of plant protein crops .
<2en> In its new form , this report does not enable us to do that .
<2en> I will vote against this report if GMOs and animal meal are approved by this Parliament .
<sp>
<2en> It is essential to increase production of protein crops - plants rich in protein - with the goal of reducing dependence on imported soya , maintaining food security and benefiting the environment .
<2en> There are scientific studies available demonstrating the environmental benefits of protein crops in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , as well as of biodiversity and soil quality improvements .
<2en> It is of great concern that only 3 % of European agricultural output is of protein crops .
<2en> It is unacceptable that we import 80 % of our requirements .
<2en> It is therefore very important that measures be taken to change this situation within the framework of post-2013 common agricultural policy aid .
<sp>
<2en> The Häusling report on the protein deficit in Europe and the search for solutions introduces some positive elements such as aid to farmers that contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions .
<2en> Despite this , I voted against the report as the text clearly argues in favour of genetically modified organisms and totally opens the doors of Europe to contaminated food and animal-based meal on European territory .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The report asks the Commission to include in the CAP reform adequate and reliable measures and instruments to support farmers in improving crop rotation .
<en> It requests a legislative proposal which authorises processed animal protein from slaughter offal for the production of feed for monogastric animals ( pork and poultry ) .
<en> If such authorisation is provided , what will change ?
<en> It is impossible to control the banning .
<en> Why spend time on a report that is unnecessary and not easy to comprehend just to put a ' tick ' for a rapporteur ?
<en> I abstained since I do not vote for unclear , ' cooked-up ' initiatives .
<sp>
<2en> Protein crops are an important part of the animal feed industry and are therefore a significant economic factor .
<2en> However , the cultivation of protein crops is an issue that has generated little positive interest in Europe .
<2en> Over the last 10 years , there has been a decline of up to 30 % in such crops , the only exception being soya , where the decline has only been 12 % .
<2en> Only 3 % of arable land in the EU is used in the production of protein crops .
<2en> As studies show , this not only leads to significant economic disadvantage because it results in an 80 % import quota , but also brings disadvantages in the area of agriculture .
<2en> This is because the cultivation of protein crops enriches the soil with nitrogen , subsequently promoting fertility .
<2en> The research sector is also suffering under the low level of demand for seed for protein producing crops .
<2en> The downward spiral has already begun .
<2en> I voted against this report because I fear that it may hamper the cultivation of traditional seed .

<en> Mr President , of course I respect Mr Mitchell 's views .
<en> Like most , if not all , of the Members of this Parliament , I deplore the fact that in a number of societies in the world , female foetuses are aborted , whether with the consent of the mother or under coercion .
<en> However , I fear that , by mixing up this issue with the issue of reproductive freedom , Mr Mitchell is obscuring the issue .
<en> If the issue were limited to the fact that female foetuses are aborted , it might be easier for us to reach an agreement on it .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to thank the honourable Member for that point .
<en> If we were a bit more respectful of each other 's positions and tried to reach common ground , we would find that there is a lot we can do to roll back on this agenda , but please can we all open our minds ?
<en> I really do find it hard that Parliament would vote down an amendment not to fund coercive abortion , not to fund infanticide .
<en> Let us have this sort of discussion and see what we can do to stop this gender-based abortion .
<en> We can have disagreements in other areas .
<en> I personally have no difficulty with reproductive health support ; it is when it comes to the abortion area I have difficulty for very good reasons and I would be happy to debate them .
<en> I am not an ogre ; I am not something from the past .
<en> I have a well thought out view on this and I would be happy to discuss it with anybody .
<en> I thank the Members for what they have said .

<en> ( EL ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , the session of the Human Rights Council is being held this year in the shadow of events in North Africa and the Arab world in general , which have a great deal to teach us .
<en> We , as Europe , must make sure that we are up to the job .
<en> This is therefore an opportunity for us to make a fundamental evaluation of the Council , so as to further improve its working methods and emphasise our support for its independence and its role in defending human rights in the world .
<en> In these times of historic change in our part of the world , the message of the universality of human rights is more topical than ever .
<en> At the same time , however , all the international players need to work to eliminate the practice of double standards when it comes to citing human rights .
<en> We need to be fair and consistent .
<en> Just as we welcome the recent adoption of the resolution condemning human rights violations in Libya , we must take the same hard stand on the continuing illegal colonisation of the occupied areas in Palestine .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , I would like to pay tribute to Mr Mitchell 's speech , as of course , the primary human right for each girl and boy is the right to be born into this world .
<en> The Human Rights Council is the UN 's main body responsible for human rights , and now at last we must venture critically to assess its status and policies .
<en> The Council at its best could have a decisive role as a promoter of human rights and democracy .
<en> Unfortunately , its work is characterised by double standards , selectivity , politicisation and the creation of blocs in human rights issues .
<en> It is typical that the Council was very close to adopting the resolution on progress ( progress mind ! ) in the human rights situation in Libya .
<en> Among the countries giving Libya recognition were Iran , North Korea , Egypt , Sudan and Pakistan .
<en> Do declarations by these countries carry any weight ?
<en> Should these countries not be the next to be expelled from the Human Rights Council ?
<en> Just the fact that such a resolution was even considered shows just how ignorant the international community has been or has wanted to be concerning the situation in Libya .
<en> Over the last few decades , however , around two thirds of the condemnatory resolutions that the Human Rights Council has adopted have concerned Israel , which is nevertheless the sole democracy in that area of the Middle East .
<en> At the same time , it has ignored the poor state of the rights of women and minorities in all the surrounding Arab countries .
<en> The work of the Human Rights Council will lack credibility unless it changes that work and its ways of working .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I do not wish to repeat the important points already made by my fellow Members , so I will simply add that it is good to hear of Lady Ashton 's involvement in the Human Rights Council session held at this very important time .
<en> We hope that the session will constitute a step forward , allowing the European Union to make its actions more consistent and raise their profile , to reach common positions on all relevant human rights issues , and to use the Human Rights Council to build coalitions with countries , civil society and relevant international organisations , in order to make real progress in the field of human rights , as Lady Ashton said in her speech .
<en> We also hope that the European Union will be able to uphold the universal nature of human rights in the face of relativistic arguments and that it will finally achieve something that is within the compass of our generation ; to achieve something comparable with the universal abolition of slavery in the past : namely , the universal abolition of the death penalty .

<2en> Last year 's intense rainfalls resulted in a disastrous situation in Central European countries .
<2en> Overflowing rivers flooded streets and homes .
<2en> People became destitute , and many of them lost almost everything they had .
<2en> This is why a rapid assessment of the situation and quick assistance were crucial at that time .
<2en> Slovakia , Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Romania all requested assistance from the European Union in order to be able to help those in need by drawing on the Solidarity Fund .
<2en> I am very pleased to note that the European Parliament , too , recognised this situation , and it , too , intended to help these countries .
<2en> This is why I consider supporting this proposal for a decision very important , and I would like to use this opportunity to extend my gratitude to all who expressed their solidarity with my fellow Central European citizens at that time .
<2en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> Following the heavy rainfall in August 2010 , which caused rivers to burst their banks and forced people to leave their homes , the Czech Republic applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund in October 2010 .
<2en> The threshold of 0.6 % of Gross National Income was not exceeded , but the majority of the population suffered as a result and the economy of the region was on the brink of collapse .
<2en> Important areas such as tourism and industry were severely damaged .
<2en> This assistance will cover part of the cost of the immediate measures needed to rebuild damaged infrastructure .
<2en> Therefore , I support this proposal .
<sp>
<2en> Last summer , most of Romania 's territory was hit by severe flooding and landslides .
<2en> The damage was estimated at almost EUR 900 million , which is nearly 0.7 % of Romania 's GDP .
<2en> I welcome the assistance from the Solidarity Fund and it will help both to mitigate the impact of the disaster and prevent other incidents of the same nature occurring .
<2en> The Solidarity Fund is one of the specific examples which can be offered to our citizens showing the importance of joint actions at EU level .
<sp>
<2en> The Commission is proposing to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Romania , in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management ( IIA ) .
<2en> The IIA allows for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion .
<2en> Alongside this proposal to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Romania , the Commission also presented a Draft amending budget .
<2en> It is clear from the report that all the applications meet the eligibility criteria laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 2012 / 2002 .
<2en> I therefore voted in favour of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for the amounts of EUR 105 567 155 for Poland , EUR 20 430 841 for Slovakia , EUR 22 485 772 for Hungary , EUR 5 111 401 for the Czech Republic , EUR 3 825 983 for Croatia and EUR 24 967 741 for Romania , making a total of EUR 182 388 893 in commitment and payment appropriations .
<sp>
<2en> The direct costs of the floods which hit Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania in 2010 amount to EUR 5 512 719 662 .
<2en> I voted for this report so that the mobilisation of EUR 182.4 million from the EU Solidarity Fund intended for these floods is approved .
<2en> I disagreed with the source of funding , a ' negative reserve ' proposed by the Council .
<2en> However , I voted for the Council 's proposal as I think that citizens who were victims of the flooding cannot become victims of an interinstitutional battle between Member States and the European Parliament .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I would like to congratulate my colleague in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , Mr Ferreira ( PCP ) , on his report , which was adopted today by a very large majority in the European Parliament .
<2en> This report confirms the importance of fisheries management based on up-to-date , accurate scientific knowledge of stock status .
<2en> This is a sine qua non of sustainable fisheries development .
<2en> Some of Mr Ferreira 's amendments , for example , those enabling an increase in cofinancing rates ( from 50 % to 60 % ) in the area of collection , management and use of scientific data on fish stocks , were , regrettably , not adopted .
<2en> This report shows the contribution that the GUE / NGL Group can nevertheless make to debates in the European Parliament , and I know that we can count on Mr Ferreira to continue this fight for sustainable fisheries , giving priority to small-scale fishermen over industrial groups in the sector .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report by Mr Ferreira to improve the management of financial instruments for fisheries which govern the funding of a range of activities , among which are , typically , fishing controls .
<2en> I therefore consider the general agreement on the text between the Council and the European Parliament to be a good compromise in terms of the common fisheries policy and the Law of the Sea .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting for this report .
<2en> I believe that the purpose of this report is important , as it aims to extend the transitional arrangements for another 18 months , until 1 January 2013 , so that the new package of technical measures can be designed as part of the continuation of the common fisheries policy .
<sp>
<2en> Since agreement on the draft regulation to simplify and clarify the Community rules on the conservation of fisheries resources was not possible in 2008 , a regulation was adopted establishing a set of transitional measures for the period from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011 .
<2en> This report , which merited my support , is aimed at extending this transitional period until January 2013 , so that a new set of technical measures can be drawn up as part of the ongoing reform of the common fisheries policy .
<2en> It also calls on the Commission to take the initiative during this new extension period for the existing regulation and to proceed , alongside the involved parties , with an assessment of the impact that the measures currently in force have on the ships implementing them and on the ecosystems covered .
<2en> The results of this assessment should be considered when drawing up the new draft regulation .
<2en> It is equally important that the future Commission proposal on technical measures clearly establish the competences of the Council and Parliament , in line with the ordinary legislative procedure .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the proposal because the absence of an agreement on the conservation of fisheries resources may produce undesirable consequences .
<2en> The proposal to extend the validity of the 2009 Council Regulation on establishing transitional technical measures by 18 months , which means until 31 December 2012 , will enable the Commission to prepare a new package of technical measures which will become part of the reform of the common fisheries policy .
<2en> I think that the amendments are acceptable because the common fisheries policy must , on the one hand , conserve fisheries resources and , on the other , be beneficial to ordinary citizens , in this case , Ireland 's small-scale fishers .
<2en> This is precisely the reason why I think that a balance needs to be struck between catch limits , technical measures and the fishers ' needs .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon provides for exclusive EU competence in the area of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) .
<2en> This development , which has significant consequences , throws up a double challenge both for managing more than 1 200 bilateral investment treaties ( BIT ) already concluded by the Member States and to define a future European investment policy which meets the expectations of investors and beneficiary states while , at the same time , respecting the objectives of the EU 's external action .
<2en> When concluding BITs , the aim is to ensure that investors from developed countries have legal and financial protection .
<2en> I agree that when developing future EU investment policy , investor protection must remain the first priority of investment agreements .
<2en> The EU 's future policy must also promote investment which is sustainable , respects the environment ( particularly in the area of extractive industries ) and encourages good quality working conditions in the enterprises targeted by the investment .
<2en> Hence , the recent reform of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 's guidelines to promote responsible behaviour on the part of international enterprises should be promoted by the EU .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report .
<2en> We are all aware that , according to the Treaty of Lisbon , foreign investments are the exclusive competence of the EU .
<2en> Based on these new powers , both the Commission and Member States can devise , together with Parliament , a policy for promoting high quality investments , with a positive impact on economic growth and employment .
<2en> The crisis has led , as was only natural , to a reduction in the volume of foreign direct investments , which had reached EUR 1 500 billion in 2007 .
<2en> I also welcome the proposal to introduce the term ' EU investor ' and I believe that the protection of all EU investors should be the top priority of investment agreements .
<sp>
<2en> I share the rapporteur 's view that not all kinds of investments require the same high level of protection and that , for example , short-term speculative investments do not deserve the same level of protection as long-lasting investments .
<2en> Consequently , the scope of future European agreements must be limited to foreign direct investments ( FDI ) only .
<2en> This is the reason why I supported this report , which is among the areas coming under the exclusive competence of the European Parliament .
<sp>
<2en> Parliament wished to clarify the rules that the EU will have to introduce when negotiating future investment agreements .
<2en> In addition to investor protection , the Commission must include in all future agreements specific clauses laying down the right of the third party and of the EU to regulate in the technological areas associated with protection of national security , the environment , public health , workers ' and consumers ' rights and industrial policy .
<2en> This is a powerful signal , which has been conveyed to the Council and to the Commission on the eve of the opening of investment negotiations with countries such as Canada , India and , in the very near future , China .
<2en> European investors must adopt responsible behaviour abroad , while protecting the right of the European Union to regulate investments in the public interest .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report because I believe that the proposed investment policy will meet the expectations of both investors and the states involved , thus contributing to making the EU and its companies more competitive .
<2en> A coordinated European international investment policy could have an important impact on job creation not only in the EU , but also in developing countries .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that European political parties are basic instruments of parliamentary democracy , even if , at this stage , they are only umbrella organisations of the affiliated national parties .
<2en> I also support the idea that only those parties represented by at least one MEP are eligible for funding .
<2en> I believe that the idea of asking the Commission to propose a draft statute for European political parties , in accordance with the TFEU , is correct .
<2en> I advocate , along with the rapporteur , that we need changes to the financial regulations governing the funding of European parties and political foundations , and that funding must be allocated in full at the start of the year .
<sp>
<2en> It is a sentiment shared by all European citizens and , at this level , whether you are pro-Europe or against the integration of Europe changes nothing .
<2en> There is an urgent need to re-appropriate European issues .
<2en> Political parties at European level have considerable scope for action .
<2en> They must devise fresh perspectives and give fresh impetus to the instruments of a democratic Europe .
<2en> We must therefore relax the conditions under which political parties at European level exist in order to release energies .
<2en> We need to give a clear status to these new spaces for debate and , finally , a genuine perspective to the activity of political parties at European level in the forthcoming elections .
<sp>
<2en> I rejected this report for a number of reasons .
<2en> Many of the proposals on the direct funding and status of European political parties conflict with the national parties .
<2en> MEPs are elected by the various countries via national parties .
<2en> After their election , thanks to their national parties , they can form European groups , but while pursuing their party interests domestically .
<2en> This report does not support this idea .
<sp>
<2en> The development of European political parties is vital for generating public interest in EU affairs .
<2en> Dealing with the issue of regulating European parties is a deeper concern , linked to how to create a transnational civic space composed of free and equal citizens , and what a ' collective founding ' , in the form of a ' civic contract ' among diverse peoples , might entail for the future of integration .
<2en> Devising a reform package for European political parties as a means of mobilising the democratic energies of individual and organised citizens is not an easy task , not least due to the EU 's systemic complexity .
<2en> Strengthening European political parties is a means of enhancing participatory governance in the EU and , ultimately , of strengthening democracy .
<2en> The EU 's future rests on European political parties , complicated as it sounds .
<2en> Creating a safe and transparent environment for the operation and funding of European political parties marks a first step .
<2en> We need a European space where political parties actively put citizens at the heart of the European Union 's concerns and help them in their everyday life , at a time when it is noticeable that European citizens are detached from the Union .
<sp>
<2en> European political parties , which play an important role in shaping democracy in the EU , should be given a common and uniform legal statute .
<2en> European political parties should be bodies with legal personality , in order to be capable of overcoming the difference between European political parties and European authorities , from the perspective of taxation procedures .
<2en> As far as the establishment of European parties is concerned , it is right and proper that the statute of European parties regards European , national and regional elected representatives as being equal , as long as the regional representatives are elected members of regional parliaments .
<2en> In addition to this , every European political party should have at least one representative who is a Member of the European Parliament .
<2en> In the end , that is also a condition for a European political party to qualify for funding from the European Parliament .

<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament 's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency 's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency should consider making a Gantt diagram part of the programming for each of its operational activities , with a view to indicating in a concise form the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encouraging an approach geared towards achieving results .
<en> Furthermore , the Agency must implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts and improve performance monitoring and reporting .
<en> The Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year , so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency 's performance from one year to the next more effectively .
<en> In addition , a report must be attached to each year 's budget on the unspent appropriations carried over from previous years , explaining why those monies have not been used and how and when they will be used .
<en> The Agency still demonstrates deficiencies in staff selection procedures , which put at risk the transparency of these procedures .
<en> I agree that the Agency must inform the European Parliament on the actions taken to redress this situation and make selection procedures more transparent .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of discharge for 2009 for the General Budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency because , in spite of apparently dubious management of the funds available , the Court of Auditors has considered the accounts to be reliable and the underlying transactions legal and regular .
<2en> Moreover , I agree on the need for the agency to put in place more precise mechanisms for setting its objectives and for evaluating the results .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I welcome the decisions outlined in the report by the Court of Auditors that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> I welcome and agree with the rapporteur 's observations , and I congratulate the European Aviation Safety Agency on the work it does .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I endorsed this document , as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> However , it expressed concern about the lack of coordination between the needs , staff and financial regulation of the Agency and , in particular , that staff selection procedures made it difficult to recruit appropriately qualified personnel .
<en> I therefore believe that it is necessary to take the current observations into account .
<sp>
<2en> With today 's vote budgetary discharge for 2009 has been granted to the European Aviation Safety Agency .
<2en> Financial control of the implementation of the Community budget takes place at three levels : internal control , within each institution ; external control by the European Court of Auditors ; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament .
<2en> Clearly , every debate on discharge has its own specific context and today 's discharge has taken place at a time of economic and financial crisis , which has created both financial and budgetary problems for some Member States .
<2en> In spite of such conditions , I wish , nonetheless , to express satisfaction at the results achieved by the Agency and have therefore voted in the manner proposed by the rapporteur .

<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I abstained from voting on the discharge of the Euratom Supply Agency , which has the task of ensuring the European Union is provided with fissile materials ( including any stores ) .
<en> According to this report , there are currently inconsistencies as regards the present organisation of the Agency and its legal form .
<en> This raises the issue of whether the Agency needs to be maintained in its current form and with its current organisation .
<en> I would have liked to have seen this matter clarified , particularly in view of the current Europe-wide rethink on nuclear power .
<sp>
<2en> I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009 .
<2en> The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Foundation 's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<2en> I welcome the Foundation 's intention to set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year .
<2en> This will enable the European Parliament to assess more effectively its performance from one year to the next .
<2en> I believe that the ex-post assessment exercise of the Foundation 's 2005-2008 work programme is extremely useful for the Foundation .
<2en> This exercise gives the Foundation helpful lessons and recommendations with regard to the challenges facing its future programming phase .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that the Foundation must further develop its Eurofound Performance Monitoring System to ensure that the results of its performance monitoring are fed back into management decision-making and planning .
<2en> I also believe that the Foundation must take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure in the area of procurement to avoid future repetition of the assessment errors and inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors .
<2en> Furthermore , the Foundation must make sure that funds are only used when appropriations are approved .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions because the audit conducted by the Court of Auditors on the accounts and the underlying transactions shows that the Foundation has done correct , timely and transparent work .
<2en> Notwithstanding some weaknesses in recruitment and procurement procedures , I remain steadfast in my belief that there are good prospects for future improvement and that the Foundation is committed to putting them into action .

<en> The Court of Auditors found that under certain circumstances the EDPS may run the risk of making incorrect payments to staff .

<2en> This own-initiative report is devoted to the issue of the study mobility of young people , which arises from the 2020 strategy .
<2en> It is undoubtedly right to increase the competitiveness of young people by creating conditions within the framework of university education for them to spend at least one year in another Member State .
<2en> Mobility , a system of recognising credits and other measures will limit the growth in unemployment among young people , which stands at an average of 21 % in the EU today , which is an alarming figure .
<2en> Personally I very much welcome the appeal to the Commission and the Member States regarding support for voluntary activities , and for measures to be introduced in legislation that would make it possible to recognise voluntary activity by the unemployed as time spent working .
<2en> This measure will lead , particularly with young people , to a strengthening of work habits , to greater competitiveness and to greater motivation in seeking work .
<2en> In my opinion , it is no less important to have a permanent link between the requirements of the labour market and professional education , a link that has to be highly flexible in this regard , so that future graduates can be best placed on the labour market , bringing about a gradual reduction in unemployment among young people .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to emphasise my strong support for the ' Youth on the Move ' framework , aimed at improving education systems and vocational training in Europe .
<2en> I think that this is of paramount importance with a view to developing specific policies supporting youth mobility and facilitating a stable transition for them from the education system to employment .
<2en> An important factor which needs to be considered is that young people are one of the social groups hit hard by the global economic crisis .
<2en> We have a duty to support young people entering the labour market , both for their sakes and to support the European economy .
<2en> Today 's young people are the leaders of tomorrow .
<2en> This is why it is vital for them to have the opportunity to develop their skills , abilities and knowledge now so that , in the near future , they can make an active contribution to the European Union 's growth and development .
<2en> We must lay the foundations for concrete policies which will support young people and provide them with greater mobility and opportunities to study abroad .
<2en> The role of this mobility is not only to support the economy but , at the same time , to make an extremely important contribution to creating cultural cohesion at European level .
<sp>
<2en> I consider our discussion devoted to education and culture to be an important one , and would like to add an approach that so far has been missing from numerous important considerations .
<2en> Mutual understanding and respect for one another are fundamental conditions for traditional national communities , minorities and majorities living together harmoniously and prosperously .
<2en> Education plays a vital role here .
<2en> If the history and literature of minority communities were taught in majority schools , and if minority education efforts were to include majority culture , communities living together would get along with each other more harmoniously .
<2en> Language education also has a prominent role in cultural understanding .
<2en> This is true not only in the process of learning world languages , but also in the relationship between majorities and minorities living alongside each other .
<2en> I believe that it is not only minorities who should have to study the language of the majority , but also vice versa .
<2en> Everybody could live a richer life , allowing mutual respect for one another to manifest itself .
<2en> At the same time , in knowing each other 's language , generations growing up would develop a much more positive attitude towards each other , allowing them to create relationships with their peers of the same age more easily , which would be decisive with regard to the future of these regions .
<2en> And lastly , I find it important to mention the importance of a deep understanding of cultural heritage , so that communities living together can recognise and respect each other 's cultural values .
<2en> I believe that the concrete task of the Commission is to promote all of these issues , while that of Parliament is to strengthen theoretical and political support .
<sp>
<2en> Young people are the driving force of any society and its future .
<2en> Their education , vocational training , qualifications and integration into the labour market provide the basis for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives aimed at smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
<2en> This is why I firmly believe that Europe must continue to invest in their development and initiatives like Erasmus , Leonardo and ' Youth on the Move ' should be constantly developed further and made popular .
<2en> Improving the quality of education and training , as well as young people 's access to it , are important steps on the way to reducing unemployment and developing the European economy .
<2en> Unfortunately , Europe still has regions and social groups where there are limited conditions for this .
<2en> Efforts must be coordinated to resolve this problem .
<2en> It is also important for education and training programmes to be more closely linked to business needs and to stimulate young people 's potential and creativity so as to make them more competitive on the labour market .
<2en> I support the efforts to encourage youth mobility , both during their education and in connection with their professional life .
<2en> I think that this is an important condition for developing new skills and their self-awareness of their European identity .

<2en> The cultural dimension of the EU 's external actions is one which is important and very much needed .
<2en> Around the world generally , European culture is seen as attractive and desirable .
<2en> It is more difficult to find acceptance for European values .
<2en> Working in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly , I have repeatedly experienced cultural differences and their consequences .
<2en> As Europeans , we try systematically to promote values and principles which , for us , are fundamental and inalienable .
<2en> This quite often meets with a lack of understanding from our partners .
<2en> Some of them see in this nothing less than a kind of cultural imperialism .
<2en> This is precisely why it is so difficult to persuade our partners that the values promoted by the European Union are not an attempt to impose our way of thinking on others .
<2en> The fact that we try to spread our ideals , for example , in the field of human rights , follows simply from a moral imperative .
<2en> We respect difference and diversity , but we cannot give up principles which we consider to be fundamental .
<2en> We will not accept discrimination , and we will not give up the protection of human life and human dignity .
<2en> On this , the Union is united and in full accord .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The report we are discussing today is particularly important because it provides for the amendment of Directive 1999 / 62 / EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles .
<2en> I believe that the submission of this proposal for a new directive , the fruit of the compromise reached between the Hungarian Presidency , the Commission and Parliament , is very damaging to the Italian economy , since Italy transports around a third - or approximately EUR 200 billion a year - of all the traded goods hauled on Europe 's roads .
<2en> Once the directive has been implemented in Europe 's countries of transit , goods imported to and exported from Italy will be more exposed to the burden of additional charges .
<2en> I share the Italian Government 's highly critical view : it believes that , at a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now , the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is far from wise .
<2en> To my mind , the small breakthroughs that were achieved with the compromise have no real impact on a text that is highly detrimental to both the Italian system and the haulage industry .
<2en> What is more , the effectiveness of the measure has not been proven : road transport and its associated pollution costs will continue to increase until an intermodal infrastructure network has been developed .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted against this amendment as it is imperative that the Commission is not permitted to establish revenue-raising capabilities , even via an indirect charge , particularly without the unanimous assent of the Council .
<en> In the UK , we do not currently subscribe to the Eurovignette scheme .
<en> However , the Westminster Government is looking into rolling out HGV charges in accordance with European law by 2015 .
<en> The Commission , however , has reserved the right to make the carbon charge obligatory by 2013 .
<en> I do not wish to see UK citizens in any way contributing to any form of EU tax .
<sp>
<2en> The levying of a charge on heavy goods vehicles is a measure which penalises the outlying countries of the EU , such as Greece , Italy , Spain and Portugal .
<2en> In general , these are the countries hardest hit by the financial crisis , which has led to a fiscal and economic crisis .
<2en> In view of this , I am voting against the tabled report , as I believe the uneven application of such charges is unjust , given that outlying countries would generate most of the revenue , to the benefit of the countries of central Europe .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the El Khadraoui report on charging heavy goods vehicles as the proposal allows tariff barriers to be introduced , which will increase the costs for freight operators in the peripheral Member States .
<2en> The directive will also allow Member States to offer compensation in exchange for these charges , which could result in the distortion of competition between operators from different EU Member States .
<sp>
<2en> Parliament has just given its go-ahead for new rules on road transport charges , thereby making it possible to ensure the development and funding of a more suitable transport policy with regard to environmental requirements pertaining to pollution and noise .
<2en> While road haulage companies will now have to pay the cost of air and noise pollution generated by lorries , Member States will , in return , be obliged to reinvest the revenues obtained from these charges in pan-European transport networks and , especially , in more effective and less polluting transport systems .
<2en> These charges are a step forward , but they are not enough .
<2en> It is time that Member States committed to implementing a genuine freight development policy and thus to making consistent use of all rail and road transport infrastructure .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report presents a pragmatic approach to not wasting any more time on the adoption of the so-called Eurovignette III Directive on the levying of charges on heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures .
<2en> It is intended to achieve the best possible compromise between Parliament and the Council .
<2en> The proposed amendments are the result of consultations with the political groups .
<2en> In view of this , I voted in favour of this report , as it will allow the Member States , if they so wish , to also charge road users for some limited external costs , with the aim of introducing the ' polluter pays ' principle to road transport .
<2en> It will also give Member States more opportunities to make their respective national road pricing systems more efficient , which means a better instrument for transport demand management .
<2en> These objectives were confirmed by the Council 's position .
<2en> It is worth highlighting the proposal to earmark the revenue from charges on external cost and infrastructure to be used for sustainable transport and trans-European networks , in particular .
<2en> Effective earmarking of this revenue , which increases accountability and transparency , will not only increase public acceptance but will also ensure the reduction of external costs on road transport .
<sp>
<2en> Under the amended Directive 1999 / 62 / EC , Member States will also be able to charge road users for some ( limited ) external costs , so that finally , the ' polluter pays ' principle is introduced in road transport .
<2en> This offers Member States additional opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient , which means a better transport-demand-management instrument .
<2en> Road toll charges for the transport sector will therefore reflect the cost of noise and air pollution , as well as infrastructure costs .
<2en> These costs will still admit of some exceptions , provided that the Member State requesting them has a good reason for doing so .
<2en> There will be incentives to promote the renewal of the fleet of heavy goods vehicles , derogations for heavy goods vehicles fitted with less polluting engines and , finally , the toll charge may vary according to the time of travel .
<2en> This is to ensure that heavy goods vehicles can avoid certain road sections during peak hours .
<2en> The revenues generated from this toll charge increase will have to be reinvested in transport infrastructure , with at least 15 % to be earmarked initially for trans-European transport projects .
<2en> For these reasons , and for the sake of a better road system in Europe , I voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> This directive makes provision for Member States levying a toll on heavy goods vehicles which includes an amount equal to the cost of noise and air pollution as a result of traffic , in addition to the infrastructure charge .
<2en> I believe that the ' polluter pays ' principle is not a solution , as it limits itself to leaving the decision up to the market .
<2en> Authorising and legitimising pollution if it is economically viable for the company is not a path to sustainability .
<2en> I believe that the EU 's priority should be to impose more stringent measures on pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles and to commit decisively to rail freight .
<2en> Rather than solving the problem of pollution , this directive exacerbates the inequality between Member States by placing a greater burden on outlying countries such as Portugal , which are exporters but are not crossed by major transport routes .
<2en> I voted against for these reasons .
<sp>
<2en> The proposal for revision of the Eurovignette Directive , which is at issue here , is aimed at introducing the ' polluter pays ' principle to road transport , allowing the Member States to include the cost of noise and air pollution in national tolls , which means the levying of yet another charge on heavy goods vehicles .
<2en> This measure penalises the outlying countries of the European Union , which is particularly onerous in the context of the financial crisis that we are currently experiencing .
<2en> For these reasons , I voted against this report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this compromise on the revision of the Eurovignette Directive , which aims to set ' polluter pays ' road tolls for heavy goods vehicles .
<2en> Member States will then be able to integrate in taxes or tolls levied the actual costs incurred by traffic-based air and noise pollution , whereas up to now , only infrastructure-related costs could be charged .
<2en> The compromise deal falls short of the European Parliament 's ambitions and this alone will not revolutionise road transport , for which the industry and Member States are clearly not yet ready to shoulder the actual costs of their ecological footprint .
<2en> The average additional cost to hauliers should not exceed 4 euro cents per vehicle per kilometre , and the least polluting vehicles , driving during off-peak times , would be exempt .
<2en> And yet this reform had been consigned to oblivion before the Belgian Presidency put it back on the Council 's table .
<2en> I welcome the progress made as a positive first step towards a more sustainable road transport system .

<sp>
<2en> Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation , particularly by making data available on the environmental impact of economic activities .
<2en> Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making .
<2en> Recycling and the prevention of waste , air pollution and climate change , as well as sustainable consumption and production , could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors .
<2en> In my opinion , collection of the relevant data , which has been voluntary so far , should become mandatory .
<2en> Moreover , the introduction of a common framework in this area on the collection , processing , transfer and evaluation of European environmental economic accounts would facilitate the political evaluation of European environmental policy .
<sp>
<2en> Under the Treaty of Amsterdam , a great deal of attention was paid to the interaction between economic policy and environmental policy .
<2en> That is why factors such as sustainable transport and energy resources have become key elements in other sectoral policies , too .
<2en> Indeed , back in 2006 , the European Council called on the Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development , in order to provide the most consistent data possible .
<2en> I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation because I believe it can facilitate the work of national statistics offices by enabling them to compile harmonised and timely environmental accounting data .
<2en> In this respect , the adoption of a European legal basis for the collection of data on environmental economic accounts will mean that estimates can be provided at European level regarding the existing interaction between economic and environmental factors .
<2en> Lastly , I hope that this instrument will be seen as further confirmation of the leading role played by the European Union internationally with regard to environmental accounts .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the Leinen report which , in the guise of so-called environmental statistics , unleashes an avalanche of information requiring a huge amount of bureaucracy , and all this in the name of green evangelicalism .
<sp>
<2en> Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation , particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities .
<2en> Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making .
<2en> In its June 2006 conclusions , the European Council called on the EU and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development .
<2en> This Commission proposal for European environmental economic accounts is a valuable contribution to this political approach .
<2en> A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available .
<2en> Mandatory data collection by the Member States is therefore necessary .
<2en> Environmental data currently available at European level should be expanded in the medium term to facilitate policy assessment .
<2en> Recycling and waste prevention , air emissions and climate change , sustainable consumption and production could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors .
<2en> I abstained from the vote on this document because I do not believe that such information can be gleaned purely from environmental accounts .
<2en> It is essential to ensure the cooperation of all Member States and full harmonisation at EU level .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report .
<en> Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation , particularly by making data available on the environmental impact of economic activities .
<en> Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available .
<2en> Mandatory data collection by the Member States is therefore necessary .
<2en> We refer , in particular , to the collection of data regarding air emissions , environmental taxes applicable to various economic sectors and macro-economic material flow accounting .
<2en> In our view , environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation , particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities .
<2en> Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making .
<2en> We agree that a verification clause should be introduced and that the Commission should report regularly on the implementation of the regulation in practice .
<2en> We believe it is important to verify the reliability and comparability of the data in order to be able to make improvements and guarantee a high standard of environmental accounting .
<2en> Due account should also be taken of the development of new modules and experience acquired in the course of pilot studies .
<2en> The verification report should be regarded as an opportunity to adjust the regulation in the light of fresh developments and experiences .
<sp>
<2en> I believe that a better range of statistics on the environmental consequences of the policies of Member States and the EU is needed , as well as on accounting for certain taxes that support environmental policies .
<2en> It is unfortunate that statistics and taxes are lumped together under ' environmental accounting ' .
<2en> The aim of this assimilation is to implement the climate market and its stock rights relating to pollution .
<2en> The delegation of powers to the Commission is also heading in this direction .
<2en> I voted in favour as I support the idea of the necessary statistical instruments , although I reject the policies that they serve .
<sp>
<2en> There needs to be agreement on how to prepare model statistics on the environmental impact of EU and Member State policies as well as on tax accounting which supports certain environmental policies .
<2en> That much is obvious .
<2en> It is , however , regrettable that statistics and taxes are included indiscriminately in ' environmental accounting ' .
<2en> The reason behind such a lack of discrimination is the implementation of the climate package and its market trading in pollution rights .
<2en> The delegation of powers to the Commission is also moving in the same direction .
<2en> And yet I am voting in favour of it .
<2en> I want to validate the notion of necessary statistical instruments even if I reject the policies that they may serve .
<sp>
<2en> It is vital that environmental economic accounts contribute to policy evaluation , making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities .
<2en> Such information could be extremely valuable for the purposes of environmental policy making .
<2en> We need to know how to define the aim and purpose of this proposal for a regulation , together with its contribution to the overall ' GDP and beyond ' strategy .
<2en> This regulation provides only for the collection and compilation of data regarding air emissions , environmental taxes applicable to economic sectors , and economic material flow accounting .
<2en> This is a first step towards developing more comprehensive environmental accounting since , according to the competent European and national statistics offices , it is only in these areas that data for the whole of Europe is currently available .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to continue to make advances so that statistical data on the environment is increasingly reliable and forthcoming .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Recycling and prevention of waste , air emissions and climatic change , and sustainable consumption and production , could be monitored much more effectively if high quality data were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors .
<en> The relevant data collection , which , until today , was made on a voluntary basis at EU level , should become therefore mandatory .
<en> Moreover , environmental data currently available should be expanded in the medium term to facilitate the necessary policy assessment of the European environmental policy .
<en> I agree with the rapporteur 's position and I voted in favour .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( CS ) More than 400 petitions delivered to the European Parliament draw attention to the widespread misleading commercial practices employed by certain ' business directory companies ' , consisting of persuading businesses and also non-profit entities to register free of charge in a directory , only to discover that they have signed a contract that also entails a fee .
<en> However , directory companies are often established in a Member State other than the one in which their victims are based , making it difficult for the latter to seek protection or redress from national authorities .
<en> Regrettably , Directive 2006 / 114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising , which applies to business-to-business transactions , fails to provide a sufficiently effective remedy or is inadequately enforced by Member States .
<en> Since the Commission is obliged to ensure that this directive is properly implemented by Member States , it should take stock of the situation , and , where necessary , take appropriate corrective action .
<en> In particular , it has a duty and a responsibility to stop the misleading commercial practices used by ' directory companies ' .
<en> The production of some sort of blacklist of the misleading practices employed by these companies could be of at least some assistance here .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted against the motion for a resolution on misleading business directories as the UK operates its own misleading marketing regulations via the Office of Fair Trading , which controls the regulation of open and honest trade and contracts within the UK .
<en> However , such regulations do not encompass misleading contracts in other Member States .
<en> Yet homogenising EU law on the issue would undermine British competence in this area and also open up further channels for EU businesses to exploit the British market as they may be able to circumvent EU law .
<en> In the UK , the Chambers of Commerce and UK Trade and Investments offer access to secure business directories and networking opportunities through programmes such as the Overseas Market Introduction Service , Passport to Export and even the European Enterprise Network .
<en> It is paramount that these directories are given prominence in the UK market and are not expunged by allowing EU companies to flood the British market under the aegis of EU trade legislation .
<sp>
<2en> The misleading trading practices used by publishers of business directories chiefly affect small businesses , and so have substantial negative consequences for the sustainability and development of the economy .
<2en> Therefore , and taking into account the constant recurrence of this problem throughout the EU , I welcome the draft resolution proposing to tackle such activities .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - MEPs have received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies affecting thousands of mostly small businesses .
<en> The misleading business practices in question typically consist in luring businesses , as well as professionals and non-profit entities , into being listed in a business directory free of charge only for the signatories to later discover that they have signed a contract with a fee .
<en> Indeed , the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State , making it difficult for the victims to seek protection or redress from national authorities .
<en> I support this resolution .
<en> The directive on misleading and comparative advertising ( 2006 / 114 / EC ) , which applies to business-to-business transactions , is insufficient in providing an effective remedy and is also inadequately enforced by Member States .
<en> The resolution urges the Commission to verify Member States ' correct transposition , implementation and national enforcement of the directive and to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible , notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories .
<sp>
<2en> Misleading advertising and dishonest trading practices undermine consumer confidence and thus work to the detriment of the Internal Market .
<2en> It is therefore vital that European legislation should protect consumers and businesses against this kind of practice .
<2en> As regards misleading practices in business directories , which are common and have a disastrous effect on businesses , I consider it a good sign that the relevant legislation is being overhauled so as to put an end to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories , namely through the creation of a blacklist of misleading practices used by business directories .

<sp>
<2en> In the context of the current crisis that the European Union is going through , the recently introduced cohesion policy is one of the effective ways to kick-start the EU 's economy .
<2en> The Mikolášik report on the implementation of the cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 , which I supported , is in this respect a useful contribution for redefining the objectives of such a policy .
<2en> By calling for simplified , enhanced and transparent aid allocation within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy , this report seeks to stimulate the European cohesion programmes in order to address administrative burdens , the latter being the reason why most allocated funds are currently being withheld .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report on the implementation of cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 , as I believe that it is necessary to adapt cohesion policy to the challenges that the European regions are facing , supporting smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
<sp>
<2en> Cohesion policy remains one of the most important pillars of EU policy , as it is fundamental for realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> For this very reason , cohesion policy should continue to strongly support all the European regions , contributing to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
<2en> At a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented economic , financial and social crisis , which is particularly affecting certain regions that were already weaker , it is vital for the future that cohesion policy continue to play its fundamental role in balanced and sustainable development .
<sp>
<2en> This document , for which the rapporteur is Mr Mikolášik , follows the Commission communication entitled ' Cohesion policy : Strategic Report 2010 on the implementation of the programmes 2007-2013 ' .
<2en> This is the first rigorous assessment of the implementation of the some 450 operational programmes adopted by the Commission .
<2en> EU cohesion policy is part of a European framework of solidarity that encompasses the 27 Member States and their 271 regions , and aims to end existing economic and social disparities within the EU .
<2en> This report is of even greater importance given the economic and financial crisis that Europe is experiencing , so it should be an instrument for reallocating and maximising cohesion funding .
<2en> Indeed , given the low rate of implementation , there is a need to create mechanisms enabling the most disadvantaged Member States to make use of the funds allocated to them or risk them being forced to return these funds to the EU , which will redistribute them to richer countries .
<2en> I welcome the adoption of this report , for which I voted , not only because of the solutions it proposes , but also because of the structure that it suggests for future cohesion policy .
<sp>
<2en> This report acknowledges the existing problems with cohesion policy , beginning with the delayed conclusion of negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) and the legislative package , resulting in the belated implementation of the national strategies and operational programmes .
<2en> These factors are compounded by the inadequacy of the funds provided for the 2007-2013 period , particularly taking account of the enlargement of the EU , and the use of only 27.1 % of available resources in the current period , as well as the continuation of national cofinancing and the administrative burden .
<2en> This situation lays bare some of the errors and weaknesses of cohesion policy which we have always denounced .
<2en> Countries like Portugal are drifting ever further from the promised economic and social development that would move them closer to the EU average .
<2en> National cofinancing continues to be an obstacle to accessing funds , particularly for countries with weaker economies , which continue to see many millions of euro returned to the countries that benefit most from the main EU policies , specifically the Economic and Monetary Union and the internal market .
<2en> This increases the disparity between these countries rather than reducing it .

<2en> Mr President , I am speaking for my Group , since its chairman cannot be here at this time for reasons beyond his control .
<2en> And in expressing my Group 's view , I want to say that we agree with the proposal that reference should be made to the Cyprus problem on Wednesday in the statements by both the Commission and the Council .
<2en> Mr President , granted the experience we have , it is unthinkable to debate the situation in Turkey , to discuss whether and to what extent Customs Union has been implemented , without also mentioning the Cyprus problem which is absolutely linked with both those subjects .
<2en> In that way , the debate can be more complete and there can be a resolution which , of course , will refer to all three issues : the situation in Turkey , Customs Union , and the Cyprus problem .
<2en> The issue is different under the urgency procedure : in that case the Cyprus problem stands alone because of the murders that took place in the middle of August .
<2en> That is another matter .
<2en> We should not let one issue get in the way of the other .
<sp>
<en> So , we are agreed on the procedure .
<en> The groups will mention what they consider necessary on Wednesday , and you will decide on Wednesday morning whether or not to leave the item ' Cyprus ' on the list of topical and urgent subjects .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I hope the cancelling of Question Time to the Council is an absolute exception .
<en> I would like to point out to you that when it was decided to move Question Time from its late evening position to an earlier slot , we were assured that it would not be pushed off the agenda .
<en> So , may I have your assurance that this is an exception .
<sp>
<en> This is really only intended as an exception , Sir Jack .
<en> The group chairmen were agreed , however , that in the special circumstances which we have this week , Question Time could not be held for reasons of time .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , a small correction to Tuesday 's agenda as regards the Rocard report .
<2en> At the Conference of Presidents last Thursday , it was agreed to start the debate at 4.30 p.m. to comply with the Council 's request , but not that it should only go on for an hour , till 5.30 p.m.
<2en> Granted that the Rocard report will start at 4.30 p.m. , it could also continue into the evening if necessary , given the importance of the issue .
<2en> I think that simple correction is in line with the Group Presidents ' decision .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> This proposal has much merit and we will certainly look at it .
<en> There is not , as far as I am aware , a specific proposal under consideration in the Council of Ministers at present , but the Belgian Minister 's proposal has much merit and I would like to see it examined .
<sp>
<en> Question No 4 by Otto von Habsburg ( H-0720 / 96 )
<en> Subject : Political situation of the Principality of Monaco , the Principality of Andorra and the Republic of San Marino
<en> Has the Council given any consideration to the future development of the legal and political situation of the Principality of Monaco , the Principality of Andorra and the Republic of San Marino which are surrounded by territories of the European Union ?
<en> Would the Council be prepared to make these states an offer which would enable them to be more involved in the objectives and work of the Union without having to sacrifice their sovereignty or independence ?
<sp>
<en> The political and legal status of the three states in question does not undermine in any way the policies of the European Union .
<en> Andorra and San Marino have concluded agreements with the Community making them part of its customs area and of the regulation of issues of mutual interest .
<en> The day-to-day management of these agreements is regulated by decisions of the mixed committees established by the agreements .
<en> Monaco is also indirectly part of the Community customs area .
<en> Its association with the objectives and work of the Union is effected by means of the Guarantee Agreement of 1918 and the Customs Convention of 1963 between the Principality and France .
<en> If it were to arise that future developments going beyond the framework of the abovementioned agreements were to risk undermining the functions of the single market or other Union policies , the Council considers that the Commission and Member States , acting on issues pertaining to Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union , will take all necessary measures both at Community and Union levels .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to thank the President-in-Office for the detailed information he has provided on economic and financial matters .
<2en> However , I should also like to know whether there is a structured dialogue with these States , or whether such a structured dialogue might not serve a purpose , for example , in connection with questions of internal security , because there are wide aspects of internal security which concern these States in particular .
<sp>
<en> Structured dialogue only takes place with the associated states .
<en> But I can say that there is regular dialogue with these states and the European Union .
<en> I personally met with the Foreign Affairs Minister of San Marino within the last ten days and we had a very worthwhile exchange .
<en> I am not aware of any pressure from any of the states mentioned in the question for improved dialogue with the Union and I believe that the dialogues which exist are working reasonably satisfactorily .

<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I am just taking the floor briefly to point out that the Green Group and many other Members tabled amendments once again this year to mark the fact that , through its farm price support for the beef sector , the European Union is continuing to fund bullfighting .
<2en> Since we feel that this is totally at odds with the spirit of the Treaty , and with the sensibilities of most members of European society , we feel that we cannot go on subsidizing such a cruel form of spectacle , which has a coarsening effect on those who go to watch it and is cruel to the animals involved .
<2en> For these reasons , the House spoke out against this activity last year , at least in the form of a recital , leaving it to the Commission and the Council to take appropriate action .
<2en> Nothing was done .
<2en> That is why similar amendments have once again been tabled , and on behalf of the Green Group , I express my support for these , even though the House has unfortunately not seen fit to follow our approach .
<sp>
<en> We are abstaining from voting on this report because we think that the Common Agricultural Policy must undergo fundamental reforms .
<en> The current tightly regulated agricultural policy is bureaucratic , ineffective and unjustifiably politically divisive .
<en> We hope that agricultural policy will be drastically reformed in 1999 and will do all that we can to see that this happens .
<sp>
<en> With regard to amendment proposal No. 9 concerning fully grown cattle , it was with great disappointment that I noticed that the European Parliament did not approve the amendment proposal on bull fighting .
<en> I cannot understand how the European Parliament can approve the use of EU agricultural aid for animals which are used in bull fighting .
<en> This mad , barbaric manner of treating animals should not , in my opinion , be given any economic support .
<en> I personally supported the amendment proposals on this without hesitation .
<sp>
<en> The European Parliament has to consider sixteen regulations setting 1998 agricultural prices .
<en> The background for this annual - but today especially gloomy - agricultural mass can be summed up in three dates :
<en> 1999 the single currency and the ' year III package ' on five-year budgetary programming ; 2000 the opening of negotiations at the WTO ; 2002 the beginning of enlargement to the East .
<en> These three dates , three violent upheavals , give the Commission grist to its mill in its accountant 's view of a policy of austerity and rationing .
<en> That explains why 1998 farm prices have been frozen , with a reduction in compensatory aids and a lowering of cereal and oil-seed prices , together with a reduction in set-aside premiums - the 1998 setaside rate was already around 10 % , with a threat of a basic rate of 17.65 % .
<en> This rationing is justified given the levels of overproduction and excessive stocks .
<en> Brussels is showing one of those early 1990s disaster movies , threatening us with stocks of 58 million tonnes of cereals in 2005 , on the pretext of a good harvest of 202 million tonnes in 1996-1997 , 60 million in France alone .
<en> Yet the Commission obviously omits to state that world stocks are at all time lows , only 40 consumption days of stocks .
<en> So much so that , in order to maintain stocks on the European market , a 15 ECU per tonne surcharge is being levied on exports .
<en> It seems that we have gone back to the Ancien Régime , when cereal shortages were arranged to benefit a few people .
<en> In other words the real solution would be to abolish both ordinary and extraordinary set-asides .

<en> Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Funk , and Parliament as a whole for having effectively given priority to the Commission 's proposal setting the rate of compulsory setaside at 5 % for the 1998-9 season and introducing certain related measures concerning the sanctions provided by the support system for producers of arable crops if the basic area is exceeded .
<en> The extension of the 5 % setaside rate is justified in a market situation that is notable for the absence of substantial cereal stocks , both in the Community and on the world scale .
<en> The proposal for the 1998 setaside rate is supplemented by a further exceptional suspension of the setaside system in the event that the basic area is exceeded , and by a temporary adjustment of the sanctions system in the event that an irrigated ceiling is exceeded .
<en> As last year , the Commission 's proposal also provides for a reduced increase in compulsory setaside , in the event that one producer transfers his setaside obligation to another .
<en> Some Member States and the European Parliament had asked for a proposal for the month of June .
<en> I have duly noted the comments made by speakers on this subject .
<en> But the Commission wanted to wait in order to obtain a more reliable estimate of this year 's harvest .
<en> However , in order to arrive at a compromise on the price package - and God knows that , as the days and hours pass , the Commission is sometimes persuaded to support a compromise within the Council of Ministers - the Commission agreed to propose , sooner than intended , it is true , an exemption from the basic rate of compulsory setaside , fixed at 17.5 % by the 1992 Regulation .
<en> The impact of climatic fluctuations on arable crop production , however , is now forcing us to adopt a policy of caution .
<en> Regarding the possibility of using setaside land for the production of legumes , this would be contradictory to the setaside obligation contained in the present Regulation - and I do emphasize that , the present Regulation - applicable to the production of protein seeds .
<en> The idea , in itself , has advantages and disadvantages .
<en> However , the Commission considers that the proposal under consideration is not the appropriate framework for this discussion , which should take place within the context of Agenda 2000 .
<en> I hope this adequately covers the concerns expressed by the last speaker , in particular .
<en> I am convinced , therefore , that the Commission 's proposal will conform to the wishes of all interested parties , and the Commission is glad that , even if there has had to be a little improvisation , we have once again succeeded in reaching an agreement .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> We shall now proceed to the vote .
<en> On Amendment No. 1
<sp>
<2en> In order to comply with the formalities , I should like to make an oral addition to Amendment No 1 , reading as follows : ' This arrangement shall apply exclusively to voluntary set-aside ' .
<2en> This forms the third paragraph of the amendment .
<2en> I repeat : ' This arrangement shall apply exclusively to voluntary set-aside ' .
<2en> That is what was agreed .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I have no objection to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf 's proposal .
<en> We shall abstain , however , because in our view it should be discussed in detail in the Committee on Agriculture before we start bringing forward such issues from Agenda 2000 .
<en> I would prefer us to discuss first what should form part of Agenda 2000 .
<en> I would ask my group to abstain today , so that we can talk that over first .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , our group welcomes the fact that the Commission has endorsed the proposal made by the Council during the negotiation of the price package : a setaside rate limited to 5 % and the abolition of the extraordinary setaside , the retention of which would have been particularly absurd when cereal stocks are as unusually low as they are at present .
<2en> Farmers will , of course , retain the option of setting aside some of their land on a voluntary basis .
<2en> During the last plenary session , our group tabled an amendment , adopted by the House , calling for precisely this 5 % ceiling on the setaside rate , because the European Union , despite the GATT agreements , has to both preserve its export vocation and reconquer its internal market .
<2en> I would remind the House of the importance of European imports of cereal substitute products .
<2en> Our group has always opposed the structural institutionalization of setaside , and we are bound to say that the facts confirm that our analysis was correct .
<2en> Our group voted in favour of the amendment tabled by the Greens , following the speech just made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , calling for the development of legumes on setaside pastureland , because this is the part of the setaside land chosen on a voluntary basis by our farmers .
<2en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )

<en> The next item is the debate on the report ( A4-0203 / 97 ) by Mr CASTAGNEDE , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , on development problems and structural operations in France under Objectives 1 and 2 ( C4-0038 / 96 - C4-0039 / 96 - C4-0040 / 96 - C4-0041 / 96 - C4-0042 / 96 - C4-0043 / 96 - C4-0044 / 96 - C40045 / 96 - C4-0046 / 96 - C4-0023 / 97 ) .
<en> The floor is yours , Mr Castagnède .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report on structural operations in France is another opportunity to emphasize the major part played by Community action in favour of economic and social cohesion .
<en> In general terms , France can be regarded as one of the richer countries in the Union .
<en> However , the twenty-six regions that make up the country differ greatly in their level of development .
<en> In the Paris region we have a GDP per inhabitant equal to 165 % of the Community average , yet it is a French region - Guadeloupe - that is classified by the Commission as the poorest region in the Union .
<en> France is also seriously affected by the decline of certain sectors of industry , while a large part of her territory is made up of rural areas where the economy is fragile .
<en> In general terms , the unemployment rate is still a cause for serious concern .
<en> In recent years , Community activities have made an important contribution to mitigating or adjusting these imbalances .
<en> France benefits substantially from the structural funds , receiving about 10 % of all appropriations over the period 1994-9 .
<en> Six regions - the four overseas regions , French Hainaut and Corsica - receive contributions under Objective 1 ; twenty of the twenty-two metropolitan regions receive Objective 2 appropriations ; and nineteen regions benefit from appropriations to underdeveloped rural areas .
<en> To these forms of aid must be added appropriations under the horizontal objectives and Community initiative programmes .
<en> Without going into detail it is clear that this aid has played a critical part in , for example , opening up the overseas departments , compensating for the effects of industrial decline in northern and eastern France and reviving many rural areas .
<en> Although the balance sheet is broadly positive , it is not of course immune to certain imperfections associated with Community aid , while the experience gained does suggest certain guidelines for future programmes .
<en> Under the heading of imperfections of the existing arrangement , particular attention should be paid to delays in the implementation of Community credits , the complexity and rigidity of procedures , various ambiguities concerning the implementation of the principle of additionality , and inadequacies in the evaluation of schemes , especially with regard to net job creation .
<en> With regard to the desirable guidelines , some are essentially of concern to the national authorities .
<en> I am thinking particularly of the need for more in-depth partnership which , in the case of France , will have to comprise broader involvement of all the local actors - not only the regions but also other local authorities and economic and social actors - in defining and implementing regional policy .
<en> Other orientations are of more direct concern to the Community authorities and should be discussed in connection with the open debate on ' Agenda 2000 ' .
<en> In this context , we can welcome the proposal for greater geographical concentration of some forms of Community aid to benefit the least favoured regions .
<en> I am thinking here , for example , of the outermost regions of France .
<en> We are also keenly interested in the idea of strengthening aid to disadvantaged urban areas , on condition of course that such aid is not made subject to a criterion of GDP per inhabitant .
<en> The ravages of unemployment and exclusion are not confined to the poorest regions .
<en> The cohesion effort cannot be exclusively regional - it must be a social objective , too .
<en> The Community action can and must set an example , and that example is needed in our inner cities , too .
<en> On the other hand , it is a matter for regret that the Commission has apparently not adopted , at present , the idea of extensive territorialization of resources to promote employment , which , it seems , are to remain linked to a horizontal objective .
<en> It does seem to us , however , that action in favour of employment would be more effective closer to the root of the problem , allowing broad scope for the initiative and responsibility of the local actors .
<en> In conclusion , we would stress the essential value of maintaining , at Community level , a strong programme of action in favour of economic and social cohesion .
<en> It is through the structural funds that Europe shows that it is not just a free trade area but an area of solidarity , too .
<en> Consequently , we are pleased to note that Agenda 2000 aims to deepen the cohesion policy to promote enlargement .
<en> Of course , steps must still be taken to ensure that the legitimate support given to the new Member States does not adversely affect the necessary continuation of the efforts made to ensure the cohesion of the Union in its present form .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , first of all I should like to thank Bernard Castagnède for the receptive attitude he has demonstrated while preparing his report .
<2en> After discussion in committee , he has in fact accepted all the amendments I tabled on behalf of my group .
<2en> Those amendments were adopted in committee , and as a result we are completely satisfied with the report in the form presented to the House today .
<2en> In this debate , therefore , I should like to confine myself to recalling the main points we felt it important to emphasize .
<2en> Everyone is well aware that we have reached a key point in regional policy .
<2en> Consequently , reports on structural operations in the Member States are of particular importance .
<2en> In this House , aware as we are of the great importance of social cohesion , we are driven by the desire to see it working better , and working with greater transparency and efficiency .
<2en> We therefore tend to highlight the failings , the problems , so as to do our best to remedy them .
<2en> That is , of course , the main objective of this type of report , but we should also strongly emphasize the positive aspects of regional policy , which Mr Castagnède has just mentioned in his speech .
<2en> Positive aspects in terms of impact on economic and social cohesion , on growth , on training , on employment , but also the formulation of a global , consistent vision to ensure the balanced development of territories within groups of regions sharing common problems .
<2en> The structural policies provide an overall consistency with a concern for jointly defined priorities - employment , respect for the environment - and they act as a step-down lever in their effect on local initiatives .
<2en> We need to stress this point , and I am glad that this report does so , because otherwise we should be giving free reign to the arguments advanced by those - and there are more and more of them in France - who call for the renationalization of aid .
<2en> Taking their cue from the record of under-utilization of funds , they suggest that this financial cycle , Paris - Brussels - regions , is too complicated and that it would be so much simpler for every State to finance this regional aid directly .
<2en> And that would be the end of one of the policies which offers the best specific familiarization of the public with the European idea .
<2en> We must fight against this tendency , stressing the positive aspects and trying , as this report tries , to suggest ways of making things work better .
<2en> The under-utilization of funds is admittedly a genuine problem , but rather than jumping to the conclusion that the financial volume is too great for requirements it would be better to wonder about the specks of grit that are jamming the mechanism .
<2en> Enough emphasis has been laid on the complexity of the procedures , and I shall not dwell on that .
<2en> But rather than indulging ourselves in regular denunciations of the technocrats in Brussels , would it not be better to start in our own backyard ?
<2en> Does not the main blame lie with the excessive French-style centralization , and the highly dirigistic supervision of the SGAR and the regional prefects , which all too often result in the marginalization of the local authorities and other local actors ?
<2en> Inadequate information , a lack of transparency in decisions and case selection , a failure of democracy at all levels of decision-making , problems with arranging joint financing - these are the obstacles to the judicious use of the European appropriations .
<2en> And what about the excessive cumbersomeness and slowness of the financial cycles , when we know that the French government budget serves as an administrative staging post and generally seems to be in no hurry to channel the funds towards the ultimate recipient , who is often left in a precarious situation as a result ?
<2en> Some undertakings , especially those in the third sector , cannot handle such situations because they do not have sufficient funds of their own .
<2en> For this reason , and because of the difficulty in finding joint financing , this sector of the social economy is virtually excluded from access to the structural funds , and it really is regrettable that we should deprive ourselves of its acknowledged know-how in matters of training and employment .
<2en> In conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome this balanced report which , although it emphasizes the responsibilities incumbent upon the Commission , is also incisive in dealing with the responsibilities of the French Government and its administration , which , in my view , are considerably more influential with regard to the difficulties to which I have referred .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , our colleagues have given us an admirable account of the development problems and structural operations in France under Objectives I and II , and the ways in which these shortcomings might be addressed .
<2en> I must also thank Mrs Lindeperg for identifying the problems that are specific to France , and caused particularly by the centralist nature of the French State .
<2en> For my part , there are two comments I should like to make .
<2en> First , in studying the structural operations in France , and very particularly in listening to the various regional officials , we have become aware of the existence of a number of inefficiencies , rigidities and delays in the consumption of those Community appropriations which , as you know , are so badly needed in the regions of France that qualify under Objectives I and II .
<2en> Two examples will illustrate my point .
<2en> The rigid criteria applied to the SMEs and SMIs mean that many projects are disqualified even though they would create large numbers of jobs .
<2en> We may also note the problems which project sponsors encounter in complying with the principle of additionality , and I suggest the Commission should give thought to this point and submit some proposals .
<2en> Finally , I would remind the House that in all probability the total Community contributions for the period following 1999 will be conditioned by the commitment rate achieved as of 31 December 1999 .
<2en> My second comment is this : in the context of the debate on the decentralized management of the structural funds initiated by Agenda 2000 , we must - as I stated in committee - find an administrative framework for the activities of the structural funds when they are granted to regions that have no administrative existence and no budgetary powers of their own .
<2en> Next , I should like to move on to two areas where the report is somewhat timid .
<2en> First , it is timid about associating the elected Members of the European Parliament for the region concerned with the monitoring and evaluation committees .
<2en> It is also timid about the future .
<2en> It seems essential to me that we should call for a transitional phase for those regions that are currently eligible for the structural funds but will no longer be in 1999 .
<2en> The Commission has given us various clarifications on this subject , and the Commissioner explained , at a meeting which I attended , that the transition after the Objective I funds will take place in accordance with a timetable that I find very interesting .
<2en> Leaving aside these two points , on which the PPE Group wished to retable amendments in the House , we welcome the fact that the competent authorities have finally been called upon to ensure adequate publicity for European aid in the form of publicly displayed plaques , panels and brochures , which will bring us closer to the citizen .
<2en> When we see the funds allocated to the structural funds today , and the number of major projects implemented , we realize that advertising for those products needs to be advertising for Europe , too , to promote public awareness of the fact that all these projects are financed by the efforts of Europe .
<2en> We shall therefore be voting in favour of the Castagnède report .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the President of the European Commission , Mr Santer , clearly stated on 16 July when presenting Agenda 2000 that the Objective I eligibility criteria will be strictly applied in 1999 , in view of the financial effort devoted to enlarging the European Union to include the new Member States .
<2en> This redistribution of European aid will take place , we may be sure , at the expense of regions that receive aid today , which include Corsica .
<2en> This announcement has caused a great deal of alarm and confusion in an island which faces serious structural and economic difficulties and is particularly pro-European .
<2en> Admittedly , European appropriations will be reduced gradually between 2002 and 2004 .
<2en> Admittedly , two current Objective I budget lines will be unaffected - the campaign against unemployment and aid to regions in industrial or rural decline .
<2en> Admittedly , too , there will be one valuable avenue in the future with the concept of a rural area within the future Objective II .
<2en> But instead of fighting a rearguard action , even an honourable one , it would be better to undertake a firm commitment to long-term consideration of the obvious imbalances and handicaps affecting Europe 's island regions , by giving greater depth to the status of islands , especially Mediterranean islands , which was effectively institutionally recognized at the Amsterdam Summit on 16 June .
<2en> It is within that framework that the future of the structural , economic and social relations between Corsica and the European Union will need to be conceived from now on .
<2en> Just when Corsica seems to be emerging - or so we devoutly hope - from a nightmare of violence and economic fragmentation , it has greater need than ever of the European Union to secure its development , just as Europe would be inconceivable without Corsica , a key region in its Mediterranean policy .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , certainly not .
<en> This is far too important an issue for the future of the fishing industry of Europe to worry about getting to lunch on time .
<en> It is our right to insist and we do so .
<sp>
<en> Agreed , I am sorry .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to ask for Parliament 's support for a small technical amendment to point 12 .
<en> Point 12 says that we must refer the decision to the Commission and Court of Auditors .
<en> I have made a slight error , because , of course , I would also like to see us referring the decision to the Council and the governments of Phare recipient countries , so we can be sure that the wise words and stringent requirements of the report are much more widely known .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I request referral back to the Committee on External Economic Relations on the basis of Rule 129 .
<2en> The reason is that the title does not cover the subject dealt with .
<2en> The resolution contains many references to the relocation of companies and direct investments within the Union and not in third countries which is what the report intends .
<2en> Secondly , the resolution is based on the industrial age whereas we are now rushing into the 21st Century in which we will chiefly be dealing with the digital age .
<2en> My group therefore hopes that by referring it back to the Committee on External Economic Relations we will get a more balanced proposal in which the above-mentioned aspects are included .
<2en> I hope my colleagues will support this .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , for the benefit of the House , this is what would be called in English ' a wrecking amendment ' .
<en> It is simply to send something back and we have been given no notice of this .
<en> At no stage in committee and certainly not in the final vote , was any indication given by the Liberals that they fundamentally disagreed with this report , as they are now doing .
<en> No other member of that committee indicated such a line .
<en> This should be regarded as being a frivolous attempt to wreck this report and it would serve no purpose to refer it back .
<en> I ask this House to reject the motion .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , in our political institutions there has never been as much talk about public health as during the past year and a half .
<2en> We have used the BSE crisis to demand that in Amsterdam the treaty was altered drastically , and that the services of the Commission were reorganized , and that above all absolute priority was given to public health .
<2en> We all championed a food policy which is based on scientific findings , and assumed that if science cannot offer any certainty , political decision-making must be based on scientifically-responsible risk management .
<2en> The fact that tobacco is not a foodstuff , but a stimulant , cannot ...
<sp>
<en> Could the ushers please sort things out there at the back ?
<en> No , I am sorry , I am not having that .
<en> Can I ask the ushers to sort things out please .
<en> Please sit down again .
<en> Mr Rosado Fernandes , can I please ask you to sit down again .
<en> We can then sort this out , please !
<sp>
<2en> Excuse me , Madam President , but he is saying that I take money from these people , he cannot say that ...
<sp>
<en> Mr Rosado Fernandes , you should have made a request to raise a point of order , that would have been quite normal .
<en> And I would have let you speak if you had made such a request .
<en> You have now done just that .
<en> Mr Blak has asked for the floor .
<en> If you could perhaps put your headphones back on , you will be able to hear what Mr Blak has to say now .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I am deeply shocked at being attacked by a member who cannot bear to hear the truth .
<2en> I have never been exposed to being violently attacked in a democratic society , being physically attacked by someone .
<2en> Madam President , I would be grateful if you would report the incident to the Presidency and that the necessary action be taken .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Nassauer is obviously responsible for his own remarks , even the political remarks he makes .
<2en> I do not want to make any more comments on that subject .
<2en> I will confine myself to saying that in this House , you have to accept responsibility ...
<2en> If you want a report to be rejected by means of a show of force by the majority , I would say to you that is not how it is done in politics .
<2en> When there are sixty amendments in Parliament ...
<2en> ( Uproar ) Madam President , please ask my Italian friends to be quiet .
<2en> I will speak in whatever language I choose .
<2en> All right ?
<2en> ( Applause ) All I wanted to say , Mrs Muscardini , is that , when sixty amendments have been tabled , you have to work sensibly , not just make gestures .
<2en> It is therefore in order , in a democratic parliament , for the Committee to whom the matter was been referred , to resume the debate , examine the sixty amendments and present another report to the House .
<sp>
<en> We have now heard all the speakers required by the Rules .
<en> I shall now invite Mrs Green to make a personal statement .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I really cannot resist it .
<en> Thank you for the invitation to speak and also for recognizing me as Pauline Green .
<en> I would just like to say that as Mr Nassauer read out one bit of the British Home Office 's brief on this , he did of course fail to read out all those bits in it that express sympathy with the report and what it was trying to do and some of the elements that Mrs d 'Ancona is trying to cover .
<sp>
<en> Mr Schulz , can I presume that Mrs d 'Ancona does not wish to speak , as you have expressed her request ?
<en> I am asking you this because the Rules say that the chairman of the committee , or the rapporteur , may speak .
<en> So , you have spoken on her behalf .
<en> That is right , is it not ?
<en> ( Parliament approved the request for referral back to committee )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Our colleague Rinaldo Bontempi has undisputedly become an expert on the fight against organised crime and the anti-corruption policy of the European Union .
<en> Current events have unfortunately just reminded us that the problem of corruption and unacceptable behaviour reaches even into the European institutions , particularly the Commission .
<en> This is why Mr Bontempi 's report has appeared at exactly the right time to invite the Commission ' to devise a comprehensive anti-corruption plan ' and to call for ' specific proposals aimed at combating more effectively corruption within the EU institutions ' .
<en> It is right and proper that this report insists on the need for more transparency in decision-making processes , for more clarity in the rules on tenders and for more effectiveness in internal controls .
<en> It also raises the difficult problem of the policy of cooperation with third countries .
<en> It is to be welcomed that the rapporteur says in the explanatory statement that it ' would be wrong to take a fatalistic view of corruption ' because it has always happened ; his reminder that ' the word ' corruption ' originally meant physical or moral disintegration ' is also positive .
<en> The fight against organised crime and corruption , the latter being one of the manifestations of the former , is a typical area in which European cooperation is helpful and should make national policies more effective .
<en> The European Union is ' an asset ' in this case , since it reinforces the action of the Member States .
<en> Emphasis must be placed on the fact that it would be advisable , when a scandal affects the Commission 's services , for the Commission to practise the transparency it so often recommends to others and not to block our parliamentary fact-finding with delaying tactics .
<en> To conclude , Mr Bontempi 's report contains sound principles and advocates realistic cooperation .
<en> That is the reason why our group voted for it .
<sp>
<en> If there is an area where the sensitivity of European citizens is particularly acute , it is corruption .
<en> Together with expectations which are never met of social Europe , tax harmonisation and democratisation of the Union , the revelation of cases of corruption - with those occurring within the European institutions being at the top of the list - causes feelings of rejection which are extremely damaging to European integration and from which the extreme right profits .
<en> The Bontempi report has the merit of establishing the broad outlines of a comprehensive anti-corruption policy , and I congratulate its author for having attempted this integrated and coherent approach which is the only one likely to succeed .
<en> However , at the same time as implementing measures aimed at reducing corruption at international level , both inside and outside the frontiers of the Union , I feel it is both useful and imperative that , as a priority , Europe reinforces the fight against corruption within its own institutions by using firm and visible measures encompassing prevention , detection through increased controls and sanctions for all forms of corruption committed by natural or legal persons .
<en> This is of prime importance .
<en> On the one hand , how can we give lessons to others and be credible without first washing our own dirty linen in public ?
<en> And on the other , for about ten years , too many allegations have been repeatedly made without the Commission reacting in a convincing way .
<en> In this area of the fight against corruption , citizens keen on democracy demand transparency .
<en> Setting up a central office for fighting corruption , as the report requests , is not enough ; it should also be insisted that cases of corruption are brought out into the open - for example by means of communications to the European Parliament - as well as the administrative , civil and disciplinary sanctions arising from these cases .
<en> As with all European texts , this transparency must apply to the decision-making processes , to the simplification of the law and also to the financial situation of anyone - including MEPs - who occupies a post open to corruption .
<en> It is also essential for these people , officials in particular , to undertake special training enabling them to be fully informed about the different types of corruption and the means to effectively combat these .
<en> Furthermore , a close link must be established between the report before us and the Bösch report which we are also considering at this part-session .
<en> The latter concerns the independence , role and status of the Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention , UCLAF .
<en> This report requests the replacement of UCLAF with an anti-fraud office - OLAF - whose jurisdiction would extend to all the European institutions and which would be supervised by a supervisory body appointed by the European Parliament in agreement with the other institutions .
<en> These two reports closely complement each other even though certain points should be dealt with in more depth , such as what is meant by the ' independence ' of OLAF .
<en> In my opinion , this body cannot become a new Community institution , which would involve a revision of the Treaties .
<en> While remaining within the Commission , OLAF should enjoy broader independence , guaranteed initially by the choice of its supervisory body .
<sp>
<en> Tax fraud , money laundering , organised crime and international crime have found extraordinary scope for development in the liberalisation of trade and the globalisation of economic activity .
<en> For those engaging in these activities , which are as lucrative as they are criminal , corruption is clearly one of the favoured means of action , both in the public and the private sector .
<en> Recent events have shown how our countries and our institutions are also to a greater or lesser extent affected by this world phenomenon .
<en> The need is clear for the Commission to follow a decisive initiative , within its terms of reference , in the fight against corruption .
<en> The challenge is a fundamental one .
<en> We should make no mistake about it : democracy , the rule of law and corruption are incompatible .
<en> The development of one necessarily leads to the perversion and then the destruction of the others .
<en> The fight against corruption must therefore be one of the priorities of the European institutions and of our states .
<en> Legal and cultural differences are clearly so important in this respect that it would for the moment be unrealistic to set the objective of achieving legislation which is identical in all points in all the Member States .
<en> It is therefore right that the Commission is proposing to proceed gradually and to concentrate for now on simplifying the concepts and approximating the laws of the Member States .
<en> In making this joint effort , it is also the responsibility of the Member States to eliminate , as quickly as possible , the most shocking aspects of their laws , particularly those which tolerate or encourage corrupt acts in other states , and to rapidly formalise the undertakings to which they have already agreed .
<sp>
<en> The Commission cannot wage the battle against corruption on its own , or assisted by an internal structure such as UCLAF .
<en> If we are to prevent corruption and fight fraud , one necessary condition is that every citizen and every journalist should be in a position to find out what is going on within the Commission and the other EU institutions .
<en> We therefore need a fully-fledged system of open government in order to halt corruption .
<en> The risk of internal fraud will be drastically reduced once EU officials know that their activities can be investigated by anyone , and not just by a handful of colleagues from their own institutions .
<en> The ECHO case illustrates the need for measures to combat the kind of fraudulent practices that are patently rife inside the EU system .
<en> The manner in which the Commission has tried to put a lid on the issue , refusing to come forward with information on what has been happening , demonstrates that it has confidence neither in the competent supervisory authorities , i.e. the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control , nor in the public at large .
<en> A sorry pass has been reached when an organisation indulges in self-protection of this kind .
<en> The report talks about ' debureaucratisation ' , but it is not clear what is meant by this .
<en> If we are truly to cut red tape , we must set about it in the right way .
<en> There has to be a proper system of record-keeping in place when taxpayers ' money is at stake , or when public calls for tender are launched , so as to avoid the ' disappearance ' of sensitive documents .
<en> On the other hand , in-house monitoring - checking to whom officials say what - is indeed unnecessary bureaucracy .
<en> Employer-employee solidarity is not achieved by means of submission and obedience , but through an open debate about what needs to be changed .
<sp>
<en> The Bontempi report covers a very relevant and serious subject which is a scourge the world over , namely corruption .
<en> The problem of corruption is , as the Bontempi report points out , one that also affects the EU 's Member States and , not least , the EU 's institutions .
<en> The question is then how that scourge is to be combated .
<en> There is no doubt that , with the globalisation of economies , the problem is spreading its tentacles across national frontiers .
<en> But the view taken by the Bontempi report that the first duty of the individual Member States and the individual EU institutions is to put their own house in order when it comes to combating corruption in their own ranks is entirely correct .
<en> If the EU Member States and the EU 's institutions do not take their responsibility absolutely seriously and honour the range of initiatives and conventions that have been adopted in the field internationally over the years , even the best declarations at EU level have no value .
<en> A combined strategy for the EU to combat corruption is not relevant in my view as long as the Member States fail to honour the commitments they have already entered into .
<en> The arguments of the Bontempi report for more centralised arrangements at EU level to combat corruption , including a central body for the purpose , mean that I cannot support the report , despite the good elements it contains .

<en> I think the Commissioner has already said which amendments are being accepted .
<en> No , that is clearly not the case .
<en> Can you tell us which amendments are being accepted by the Commission ?
<sp>
<en> The Commission is prepared to accept - with rewording - Amendment Nos 29 and 35 but it is not able to accept Amendment No 7 .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Liikanen .

<en> Mr President , the Council , like the other institutions , exercises its powers according to those conditions and for those purposes that are defined in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and in the provisions of later agreements and documents relating to amendments and additions , on the one hand , and the provisions of the Treaty on the European Union , on the other .
<en> The voting rules contained in these agreements apply when decisions are made in the Council .
<en> Extending the scope of application of decisions based on a qualified majority in the Council is one of those issues to be discussed at the conference of the representatives of Member State governments , which is to convene at the beginning of 2000 .
<en> The European Council took a decision on the matter at its meeting at Cologne on 3 and 4 June 1999 .
<en> In the Protocol relating to the institutions and EU enlargement and which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam , there are provisions for convening this Intergovernmental Conference .
<en> The honourable Member ' s question thus does not fall within the area of responsibility of the Council but of that of the conference of representatives of Member State governments .
<sp>
<en> I would just like to follow up the response from the President-in-Office of the Council to this question by mentioning the Luxembourg Compromise which we do not hear much of now .
<en> The question is asked - the opinion of the Council about federalism - about surrendering sovereignty to majority voting .
<en> Is the Luxembourg Compromise still regarded as being in force and being respected and would you not agree that it should be ?
<en> I mean the compromise by which it is understood that the vital national interests of a Member State will not be overruled by a majority vote in Council .
<en> That is my understanding of that compromise .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , a compromise was made in Luxembourg at the time , and it is in principle still in force , although it might be said that no one has recently insisted that it be applied .
<en> Perhaps we should also mention that after that the Ioannina compromise was made .

<en> Question No 14 by ( H-0583 / 99 ) :
<en> Subject : Brominated flame retardants There have recently been alarming reports in Sweden of high levels of brominated flame retardants in fish in the Baltic .
<en> The Swedish government has promised to ban brominated flame retardants in 2004 and to press for reductions in their use .
<en> How does the Council intend to deal with the problem of brominated flame retardants ?
<en> Does it intend to seek a ban at EU level , and if so , when ?
<en> Would a unilateral Swedish ban on brominated fire retardants be regarded as hampering the free movement of goods and thus as an infringement of EU law ?
<en> The President-in-Office of the Council has the floor to respond to this question .
<en> We trust in the wisdom of the Council .
<sp>
<2en> - ( SV ) The honourable Member has asked a question concerning the high levels of brominated flame retardants in fish in the Baltic .
<2en> As the Member is aware , the Council has promulgated legislation which makes it possible to assess and reduce the risks to the environment and to people ' s health constituted by hazardous substances .
<2en> Furthermore , the Council ' s conclusions concerning the further development of the European Community ' s policy on chemicals were adopted by the Council - that is to say , the Council on the Environment - on 24 June of this year .
<2en> In these conclusions , the Council urges the Commission to submit a document concerning the new strategy on chemicals before the end of the year 2000 .
<2en> This document ought to include an outline of a new strategy for improving the identification and assessment of all chemicals .
