<en> Mr President , with great respect to the rapporteur , she is making a point which was not made at all in the debate last night .
<en> This is a report which had to be produced in great haste .
<en> Two committees made substantial input to it .
<en> It may be that , in the end , there will be some redundancy , but there are different points being made .
<en> Last night the Commissioner gave no indication that he found anything ambiguous or difficult .
<en> It is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to thank everyone for their comments but I agree most with the comment made by Mr Hänsch .
<2en> Maybe it is useful occasionally to look at how we set about things here in Parliament .
<2en> This seems a very enjoyable exercise .
<sp>
<en> I do not want to start another debate .
<en> The Bureau is looking at the working methods of Parliament .
<en> You will all receive a copy of Mr Provan ' s excellent discussion document in the near future .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the paragraph 13 which emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , states that the Legal Affairs Committee agreed to request biennial reporting , that is to say , reporting every two years .
<en> Whereas , perhaps owing to my curious accent , it was transcribed as " biannual " , which would require two reports a year and would be over-egging the pudding !
<en> I therefore request that this be orally amended to " biennial " .
<en> ( Parliament accepted the oral amendment )
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<en> Report ( A5-0125 / 2000 ) by Ms Smet and Ms Gröner , on behalf of the Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities , on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform ( 2000 / 2020 ( INI ) )
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<en> President .
<en> That concludes the vote .
<sp>
<en> Before the House adjourns you might like to hear the proposal for the organisation of business for the rest of the day .
<en> We are proposing at 3 p.m. to have a debate on the Buitenweg report , followed by the debate on items of topical and urgent debate .
<en> At 6 p.m. we will vote firstly on Buitenweg and then on the urgency resolutions and then after that , on all the other votes on which the debates have closed .
<en> That will be the agenda .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to raise the same point as Mr Wurtz , that is , the new American programme to develop nuclear weapons , and to point out that this is not merely the next stage in the nuclear weapons competition , with incalculable consequences for mankind .
<2en> The intention is to change the traditional perception of nuclear weapons , with the very real possibility of their being used in a first strike .
<2en> Similarly , countries which have no nuclear weapons of their own are being threatened with nuclear attack and the Pentagon report even suggests that conventional weapon systems should be given a nuclear capability .
<2en> Those who call themselves the guardians of civilisation are proving once again to be barbarians and the most dangerous terrorists of all .
<2en> If the nations of the world do not stop them in time , our planet may well cease to exist .
<sp>
<en> To those colleagues who have raised questions about US policy , I remind you that our debate on Wednesday morning with the Spanish Foreign Minister and President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Piqué I Camps , will deal with transatlantic relations and will , I am sure , raise our priority concerns in foreign policy .
<sp>
<en> The next item is the Commission statement on world governance , following the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and the World Economic Forum in New York .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , thank you very much for inviting the Commission to present its views on the events in Porto Alegre and New York .
<2en> I believe that this is also a good opportunity to explain the initiatives that the Commission has adopted on these issues in recent weeks .
<2en> As you know , the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey will take place very soon , the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development will take place in September and we must define our position on both issues .
<2en> Much has been written about the apparent antagonism between the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and the World Economic Forum in New York .
<2en> In both cases , agents from different cultural and ideological origins and from different areas have met .
<2en> There is no doubt that the World Economic Forum has provided a good platform for a well-founded and broad debate , without prejudices , on problems which are of urgent concern to the whole world .
<2en> However , some commentators have stated that the Porto Alegre meeting was more important than the one in New York .
<2en> It has been argued that the world 's real civil society was in attendance in Brazil and not in New York .
<2en> I would not deny the participants in the World Economic Forum the right to be considered as part of civil society .
<2en> But the fact is that the Social Forum was a significant meeting , an important event which political leaders must count on clearly from now on .
<2en> Nevertheless , I would reach the conclusion that not all the participants who met in Porto Alegre hold an anti-globalisation position .
<2en> Rather I believe that they are also part of this phenomenon of globalisation , which has allowed non-governmental movements to have a global impact , thanks to the new technologies .
<2en> It is another thing to criticise a capitalist model which could undermine social cohesion and deplete natural resources .
<2en> In this respect , the views and concerns of Davos and of Porto Alegre are perhaps not so far apart .
<2en> To achieve a balance between economic and social process on a global level , and the preservation of our planet 's resources , is a great responsibility and a difficult task which no person or country can manage alone .
<2en> The solutions are difficult and complex .
<2en> Easy solutions are sometimes popular , but they tend to ignore the secondary effects and the difficult choices and sacrifices which policies often imply .
<2en> The complexity of the genuine solutions often leads to a lack of comprehension by social movements and also by political leaders .
<2en> Therefore , we believe it is essential to carry out in-depth studies which clarify and properly explain the issues and communicate them in a clear way .
<2en> The Commission has tried to make an effort of this type by means of its report ' Response to the challenges of globalisation ' .
<2en> We avoid any type of prejudice and the study includes a series of proposed reforms of the international financial architecture , in accordance with the current world academic and political debate , and places it within the current perspective .
<2en> While accepting that globalisation has many other facets , including social and environmental aspects , the priority focus of the report is the international financial and monetary system and problems of development funding .
<2en> In producing it , we began by analysing the evolution of the process of globalisation in the economic field and identifying some of the challenges relating to the financial and monetary system .
<2en> The report acknowledges the benefits of international economic integration , but also notes the existence of systemic deficiencies and the fact that poverty is still a significant problem .
<2en> It confirms the need for greater and more effective official development aid .
<2en> The report recognises that many countries have achieved an increase in their per capita income and an improvement in the standards of living which would not have been achieved with a strategy of less integration .
<2en> It also notes a considerable increase in direct foreign investment , an essential factor in increasing growth and therefore combating poverty .
<2en> The report examines various existing proposals on international taxes .
<2en> In relation to the general use of these taxes as a potential source of development funding or public funds , we reach the conclusion that , while some of them would appear attractive in terms of short- and medium-term needs , there are not many alternatives to funding coming from national budgetary resources .
<2en> This conclusion implies an adjustment of the priorities in accordance with budgetary availability .
<2en> Another interesting proposal is the introduction of the tax on monetary transactions .
<2en> The report considers two perspectives : firstly , in relation to the so-called Tobin tax as an instrument for stabilising the currency markets , the analysis leads us to the conclusion that it is difficult to imagine that this tax would make a fundamental contribution to the stability of exchange rates .
<2en> However , if we analyse it as an instrument for increasing the resources available for development funding , the Tobin tax may appear more attractive .
<2en> It is true that its implementation would be laborious , since it would require almost global coverage in order to minimise tax evasion and would require a solid international consensus .
<2en> Even if it were possible to achieve that consensus on a political level , numerous technical problems would still arise , such as problems relating to the appropriate tax basis and collection mechanisms .
<2en> These conclusions are very similar to the Resolution on the international monetary system adopted by the European Parliament last autumn .
<2en> Another important aspect of the report is the statement that for many developing countries , technical commercial assistance and the development of capacities are important in terms of their profiting from the growth opportunities resulting from trade .
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is well placed to play a leading role in strengthening sustainable global development .
<2en> It is the world 's largest donor of development aid , the world 's largest trading partner and an important source of direct foreign investment .
<2en> Furthermore , within the framework of its commitment to protect the environment , it is developing and promoting the use and distribution of technologies which respect the environment both inside and outside of Europe .
<2en> The European integration model has developed along the lines of strategies for mutual support for stable economic growth , social development and environmental protection .
<2en> On the basis of these achievements and in view of the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg , the Commission has directed the communication towards partnership for sustainable development .
<2en> Its purpose is to point out the strategic components which will serve as a basis for a global deal in Johannesburg , with a view to ensuring that all partners , from both the north and the south , work together in favour of sustainable development .
<2en> The communication highlights several key priorities and presents concrete proposals for action in the economic , social and environmental fields .
<2en> The Commission and the Member States have committed themselves to negotiating in a constructive spirit , within the framework of the WTO , in order to continue with the process of establishing a just and free-market commercial system , in accordance with the conclusions of the Doha Ministerial Conference .
<2en> Our global objective is to increase the world 's standard of living by means of the liberalisation and development of trade .
<2en> The Community actively promotes the participation of developing countries and , in particular , the least-developed countries , in the international commercial system .
<2en> The ' Everything but arms ' initiative is an important step in this direction , but it is not enough and we urge others to follow our example and to improve access to the market for the least-developed countries .
<2en> We also adopt measures to support the efforts of the developing countries to integrate into the global commercial system and to profit from it .
<2en> In accordance with the Doha development agenda , we also recommended that the Member States increase trade-related aid .
<2en> The European Union is also contributing to the international effort to strengthen the resistance of the international financial and monetary system and to reduce the opportunities for abuse relating to the funding of terrorism , money laundering and other illegal financial activities .
<2en> The Union will continue to focus its development policy on the essential objective of reducing poverty .
<2en> It will allocate its resources accordingly and will ensure that European aid is used effectively .
<2en> Genuine practical progress could be made in terms of the quality and effectiveness of aid if the rules regulating policies and the procedures were more harmonised , both on Community and Member States levels .
<2en> However , without ignoring the need to increase efficiency , the Commission considers that there is inconsistency between the resources necessary to achieve the millennium development objectives and the agreed time limits and current available means .
<2en> Therefore , with a view to the success of the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey , the Commission has recommended that the Council increase the volume of Official Development Aid and we suggest that by 2006 all countries whose percentage of aid in relation to GNP is less than the European Union average of 0.33 % , should have reached that level .
<2en> If we achieve that objective , the European Union average would increase to practically 0.4 % , which would become a new threshold for the Member States of the Union , which , with that increase , could make a significant contribution to the development objectives of this millennium .
<2en> Furthermore , a strong commitment together with this gradual approach would consolidate the Union 's position in the negotiation of a fruitful international distribution of the burden .
<2en> Finally , in relation to the global protection of the environment , the Commission proposes to implement an initiative in the field of sustainable water management .
<2en> We have committed ourselves to putting pressure on our partners in order to achieve a restructuring of up to 50 % of the global environment facility before April 2002 and in order to broaden its mandate .
<2en> We are promoting the application of multilateral environmental agreements including the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol , which the Member States did at the beginning of this month .
<2en> Speaking in general terms , I believe that , as industrialised countries , we do not have the right to demand that developing countries make more effort to protect the environment if we are not prepared to respect our own commitments .
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , the construction of a sustainable future for the world requires the cooperation of all of us .
<2en> However , real progress can only be made if the main partners commit themselves to playing a pivotal role and in this respect I am convinced that we , in the European Union , can and must play that fundamental role .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , one in five world citizens is denied access to clean drinking water , basic education and basic health care .
<2en> The neo-liberal model has not provided any answers in these areas , nor has it made the world a safer , or more sustainable , place .
<2en> We are now looking for an alternative , not as a blueprint , but as a line of thought and action , in order to give shape to our ideals of social justice and security for everyone .
<2en> Porto Alegre and the World Forum in New York were both venues where at least the sense of urgency and the necessity to act in a more socially responsible way were on the agenda .
<2en> Porto Alegre appears to be more original , more up-to-the-minute and more creative , and also involves civil society .
<2en> It could serve as a good model for Prime Minister Aznar to promote social dialogue within Europe , which is what Belgium did .
<2en> We , as Socialists , are convinced that globalisation offers enormous scope for poor countries and excluded groups to gain access and to combat social exclusion .
<2en> Free trade should then , though , be coupled with rules and with supervision - by regional competition authorities - of concentrations of power that have grown far too big .
<2en> Protecting and supporting weaker regions and drastically opening up richer markets to developing countries fit in well within this framework of rules .
<2en> What does not , however , fit in well is protecting the strongest by introducing a network of social supervision of transnational businesses , although such a network would in itself be a good idea .
<2en> Neither is there any room for unilateral action by transnational businesses or superpowers such as the United States or for a unilateral focus on a new arms race at the expense of public provisions including education and health care .
<2en> Failure to honour the pledge to halve poverty by 2015 does not fit into this framework either .
<2en> However , this framework does offer room for fair trade with rules , democratic supervision of the global rules and social and good behaviour of transnational businesses .
<2en> It has room for respect for human values and societies in preference to commercial interests .
<2en> It allows for a modern and open world , and interest in , and respect for , each other 's differences on the basis of a common , recognised rule of law .
<2en> This rule of law comprises the right to an opportunity to shape one 's own life .
<2en> I should now like to return to the subject of Monterrey and the Spanish Presidency 's failure to translate the specific agreements of our Ministers for Development and Cooperation last week into an agreement to take practical steps towards achieving a contribution of 0.7 % of GNP .
<2en> It is not acceptable that we should first act as a satellite to the United States , which puts money and its own values first , before closing the poverty gap .
<2en> We want broad-based security , worldwide , and demand that the pledge to ensure that by 2015 all boys and girls can attend school while being healthy and well-fed , be honoured .
<2en> We , as Socialists , demand in the European Parliament that the Spanish Presidency honour this pledge .
<2en> This is our contribution to world peace , and this is how we want to translate the lessons of Porto Alegre and New York in this world into a new role for Europe .

<en> I declare open the annual session of the European Parliament for the year 2002-2003 .
<sp>
<en> I have received a request for a topical and urgent debate on the Council 's proposal to change the legal basis for the European Parliament and Council regulation amending Regulation ( ? EC ) No 218 / 92 on administrative cooperation in the field of indirect taxation ( VAT ) [ C5-0103 / 2002 - 2000 / 0147 ( COD ) ] .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , two years ago the Commission presented two proposed modifications , one of the sixth directive and the other of the Regulation on administrative cooperation .
<2en> The aim of both was to end the discrimination suffered by European companies in comparison with those of third countries , particularly American ones , in terms of the provision of services .
<2en> This discrimination is due to the fact that companies from outside the Union do not pay value-added tax when they provide electronic services , while European companies are obliged to pay it .
<2en> Since this is an urgent issue , Parliament produced two reports very quickly .
<2en> At the moment , the Council are asking us for a change to the legal basis exclusively for the Regulation on administrative cooperation .
<2en> I am not going to expand on this issue , but I wish to say they are two different things .
<2en> The Committee believes that we should not proceed with the change of legal basis , but that the issue should be studied with the greatest urgency , in order to put an end to this discrimination and , furthermore , as Parliament has requested , in order to facilitate the use of electronic means for identifying clients , putting an end to the costs which are faced in particular by small and medium-sized businesses .
<2en> I would therefore advise the House to accept the Council 's request in relation to the urgency procedure , and not accept the change of legal basis in relation to this issue .
<2en> It is one thing to deny a material request and quite another to deny it an urgency procedure so that these two proposals can be implemented very quickly .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the information on the vote on request for urgent procedure on administrative cooperation was not supplied to me in due time , or rather , it was not delivered at all , and , for that reason , I am unable to vote in favour of it .
<sp>
<en> Mr Ilgenfritz , I appreciate your request .
<en> However , I can tell you that Parliament 's services have been trying to get the translation since last night .
<en> If you insist , we shall have to postpone the vote until the relevant document has been distributed in every language .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I do not share the enthusiasm of the majority of our fellow Members for the result obtained with regard to this directive .
<2en> In fact , I think that , as regards the noise reduction policy which concerns in particular those living near airports , this seems to be a step backwards .
<2en> The proposal repeals the Council regulation that should have entered into force on 1 April 2002 preventing hushkit planes , old planes fitted with muffling devices , but whose overall performance was recognised as insufficient , from landing .
<2en> This regulation is replaced by a directive based on an approach to noise management which is supposedly balanced , but which , in fact , restricts the margin for manoeuvre by the Member States with regard to combating noise pollution and prolongs the life of hushkit planes .
<2en> The amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy may well improve the original text .
<2en> Nevertheless , we are still in a situation where the Member States who will not do anything to assist in combating noise pollution in the vicinity of their airports will in fact be practising a dumping policy which could increase over the next few years insofar as we are currently experiencing a significant rise in air traffic .
<2en> In addition to this , the legislation allowing specific action to be taken is relatively complex and will therefore slow down initiatives .
<2en> I would like to point out in this respect that , a few months ago , the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of people living near Heathrow airport in London who were complaining of nocturnal noise , and the right to a healthy environment and the right to sleep were recognised as human rights .
<2en> I therefore believe that in keeping with this decision of the Court of Human Rights , the Commission must quickly take a new initiative , a directive that not only restricts noise in the vicinity of airports , but lays down standards on noise exposure , thus allowing for harmony within the European Union .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to thank my colleague , Mr Jarzembowski , for all his hard work .
<en> As Mr Jarzembowski has explained , it is extremely important that this directive repeals the original hushkit regulation within the timeframe laid down .
<en> Without doubt , having discussed the hushkit issue on and off since many of us were elected in 1999 and for many years before , it will come as a relief that this debate can reach a conclusion .
<en> It is worth reminding some of our colleagues that , when the agreement was reached between the EU and the US at the ICAO meeting in Montreal , all Member States were represented and agreed with the proposals that were put forward .
<en> The key to those proposals was to take the balanced approach .
<en> If we are to have any credibility it would be ludicrous if we in this Parliament then reneged on what has been agreed .
<en> Speaking as someone who has lived close to London Heathrow , the busiest international airport in the world , for 30 years , and acknowledging the prosperity and jobs which flow from a successful industry , I find it extremely disappointing that perhaps some Members would prefer to score party political points rather than take on board the broader picture of what is required .
<en> What would not be acceptable would be for any airport within the EU to be in a position to arbitrarily prevent or stop legitimate carriers from operating into and out of their airport .
<en> The decision has to be made at Member State level in order to ensure a uniform application of any rules laid down .
<en> However , if we are to improve congestion and noise pollution for the future , I suggest that Member States and local authorities take responsibility for proper land use planning and think carefully before using the aviation industry as a scapegoat for their failures .
<en> Finally , having read through the additional amendments , many of which have been retabled predominantly by the Committee on the Environment , I found it somewhat disappointing that those Members found it necessary to go along that path .
<en> I hope that they will think seriously about their actions and support the rapporteur when we vote on this report tomorrow .
<en> International agreements are the way forward and we should continue to build on the agreement which was reached in Montreal .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I have listened very carefully to the debate so far and I was very interested in what Mr Stercks and Mr Lannoye said .
<en> To understand properly much of what they have said , one must consider the history .
<en> For many years , there was no sign at all of ICAO taking any action to deal with the problem of growing aircraft noise so we in this Parliament took action .
<en> We introduced the hushkits regulation which suspended the use of aircraft not retrospectively fitted with noise suppressors - the hushkits starting in April 2002 .
<en> Then suddenly , there was action .
<en> The Americans threatened legal action and sanctions and ICAO seemed to wake up .
<en> ICAO proposed new and better noise standards and guidance on sensible operating restrictions around airports .
<en> We are now asked though to rescind our regulation and to accept this new directive , which is quite clearly much watered-down , and to expect ICAO to agree on some new international standards as soon as possible .
<en> I will probably go along with this at the vote tomorrow because I agree that something is better than nothing , but we can only expect only some small improvements , and only potential improvement at that .
<en> I have to say that I am not convinced that there will be any real improvement at international level unless it is very slow as is the custom with ICAO .
<en> Therefore , if the Commission does finally get around to sending us a report in five years ' time , we might just get a chance to see what this muddled arrangement has produced .
<en> I look forward to the report .
<en> I look forward to returning to the debate and I hope Mr Jarzembowski is happy with himself because I am not sure that I am .
<sp>
<2en> Who wants incredibly noisy aircraft in Europe ?
<2en> Answer : the United States administration , both under Clinton and Bush .
<2en> From 1 April next , they want to send old , incredibly noisy aircraft with silencers to Europe .
<2en> Europe had already decided that these aircraft , fitted with a so-called hushkit , should be phased out after 1 April .
<2en> However , the US Government , which sells high numbers of these hushkits to airline companies in developing countries , has lobbied hard and effectively .
<2en> Instead of a general ban for the whole of Europe , the European Commission now wants each airport to document the fact that it does not want these noisy aircraft .
<2en> Of course , if you really want to , you can still stop these wretched old things .
<2en> But the result will be that an increasing number of these noisy old bangers will move to smaller airports .
<2en> From London to Manchester , from Maastricht to Bierset .
<2en> This is something I cannot endorse .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , as an aside , I should like to inform you that the Irish have just won the first race at the Cheltenham festival .
<en> I thought you might be interested .
<en> My views on the present hushkit legislation are on the record .
<en> It was very questionably driven by design criteria and not performance criteria .
<en> So I welcome this adoption of an ICAO balanced approach to air traffic noise reduction as it amounts to a fundamental system change for the European Union .
<en> However , I have many reservations .
<en> This Commission proposal states that noise reduction efforts are now to be assessed on the basis of individual airports , with a view to imposing operating restrictions on aircraft .
<en> It has opted for the airport-based approach along the lines of ICAO Resolution A337 .
<en> I support a package of measures for our larger and busier airports covering aspects such as land-use planning and management , operational restrictions and a ban on the noisier Chapter 3 aircraft .
<en> However , as others have said , the effectiveness or otherwise of this proposal as a means of reducing air traffic noise will only be known after the Commission has submitted its report on its findings in over five years ' time .
<en> I would particularly like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , for his hard work and the close contact he has maintained with both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission in an effort to find a way forward and - given the critical deadline of 1 April - to prevent a legislative vacuum from occurring .
<en> It is imperative for all of us in this House , if possible , to avoid a second reading .
<en> That said , it is extremely unsatisfactory for us , as legislators to have been asked to rush through such a technical piece of legislation .
<en> I am not happy about the whole procedure .
<en> I would , however , like to sound a note of caution .
<en> Although these proposals are very necessary and overdue in the context of the hushkits regulation and the US complaint and , indeed , the recent opinion of the Advocate General , the UK Government 's position points out some flaws in the Commission 's approach .
<en> So the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Thank you , Commissioner , for such a detailed reply , full of dates and numbers .
<2en> The only question which remains is , when will the provisions of the directive and the law which you mentioned to us start being applied ?
<2en> I am asking because there has been very heavy rainfall in Athens over the past two days , coupled with a strike by refuse collectors , and the huge volume of rubbish to which this directive applies has blocked all the drains and the town has flooded .
<2en> Can you tell me what is being planned apart from formally introducing this law ?
<2en> I think that there are deadlines .
<2en> Can you tell me what your views are ?
<2en> When , roughly , will the volume of rubbish start decreasing and a different sort of policy - a recycling and recovery policy - be introduced ?
<sp>
<en> The Greek Government should have already started to implement the directive so I hope that it is now properly transposed and that all the necessary measures have been taken by the Greek Government to make sure it complies with the existing directive .

<en> Question No 40 by Glyn Ford ( H-0092 / 02 ) :
<en> Subject : Water Framework Directive
<en> By 2015 under the new Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 / EC
<sp>
<en> The water framework directive has set the objective to achieve good status for all waters in the European Union .
<en> It will address all relevant sources of pollution , including industrial activities .
<en> As a tool to achieve this objective the directive follows a combined approach of emission controls addressing pollution at the source and water quality standards to be achieved for the particular water body .
<en> Complementing existing Community legislation on major sources of pollution , urban waste water discharges , pollution from agriculture and impacts from large industrial installations , the water framework directive foresees emission controls for particularly hazardous substances and water quality standards at Community level .
<en> Commission proposals for these to Parliament and the Council have to be submitted by December 2003 , also taking into account cost-effectiveness and proportionality .
<en> Participation of all relevant stakeholders will be one of the key elements of the directive .
<en> This will be achieved by mandatory public participation when developing and adopting the necessary river basin management plans , but also by broad participatory processes at EU level , facilitating the implementation of the directive .
<en> This process is to ensure input and participation by all interested and involved parties .
<en> Further , Community research efforts under the Sixth Framework Programme will support the implementation of the directive , as will the LIFE financial instrument in the field of innovative and integrated techniques and methods .
<en> Beyond those measures the Treaty provides for clear guidance as regards financing Community environmental policy being , as a rule , the responsibility of Member States .
<en> On state aids the Commission does not intend to propose changes .
<sp>
<en> I am slightly disappointed with the response from the Commissioner .
<en> While I am fully in support of strong , effective and costed legislation to force improvements in environmental standards governing water quality and other matters , and of the proper policing of such legislation , I would also like to see this stick approach complemented by , as it were , a degree of carrot .
<en> In my own region - and particularly in Cornwall , which is an Objective 1 area - we have very many small and medium enterprises that will find it most difficult to comply with this legislation .
<en> I would like to see some financial incentives or rewards introduced to enable them to stop polluting water .
<en> If we merely have , if you like , the stick approach and no carrots , then I am afraid we are going to find it more difficult to reach these standards and , at the same time , increase suffering in some of the very small enterprises in the UK county hardest hit by job losses , when we are actually spending considerable sums of money trying to create jobs there .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , with your permission , I feel I must point out that one person is still listening to the debate from the gallery .
<en> That deserves our full attention , given the hour .
<en> The Commission fully supports the terms of the proposed resolution .
<en> It comes at the right time because the Convention to prepare the next IGC has just started its work .
<en> It is very important that those who will be taking a position in the Convention and during the next IGC should be aware of the importance of this question for the effectiveness and the credibility of the Union and of the need to find an appropriate solution .
<en> We know the weaknesses of the current system and how difficult it is for outsiders to understand - just like the other solutions resisted by the Commission in the past , such as the addition of yet another legal personality to the current set-up .
<en> We have to convince people that it is essential to accord a single , full and complete personality to the Union .
<en> For this , it is obviously essential to have the active support of the European Parliament , together with the measure of agreement now seen in several parliamentary reports such as the Carnero González and Lamassoure reports , and in the opinions of the various parliamentary subcommittees consulted .
<en> The European Parliament can count on the Commission to support the terms of this resolution in the forthcoming debate .
<sp>
<en> Commissioner , on behalf of our sole but very attentive spectator , I thank you very much .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<sp>
<en> The next item is the report ( A5-0050 / 2002 ) by Mrs Carlotti , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2001 ( 2001 / 2012 ( INI ) ) .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , every year the European Parliament presents a report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly .
<2en> Since 2000 , however , the Cotonou Agreement has brought about a new context that profoundly changes the very nature of this report .
<2en> The Cotonou Agreement made profound changes to the cooperation objectives , with the new goal being a renewed partnership that is more balanced and more effective .
<2en> This means that there have to be changes in the JPA 's modus operandi .
<2en> More than just changes in the modus operandi , it requires a real cultural change .
<2en> Where are we in this process ?
<2en> The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is at a watershed .
<2en> After 2000 , which had raised great hopes of a new era in relations between the EU and ACP States , 2001 did not fulfil all its promise .
<2en> The working group did undertake a massive adaptation of its working methods , but many delays and a great deal of resistance hindered progress .
<2en> Here are three examples of this : firstly , the European States ' inertia in the ratification process .
<2en> Only three countries have ratified the agreement : Denmark , Sweden , the United Kingdom , and us , the European Union .
<2en> Although we are aware that the procedures are long in many European countries , this sends out a political message and a negative signal to the ACP countries .
<2en> All European Member States must ratify the agreement before the end of 2002 .
<2en> The second example is the untimely use of voting by separate college in the Assembly .
<2en> This is detrimental to its parliamentary nature .
<2en> I propose limited use , and in particular I propose a moratorium on its use among Europeans .
<2en> The question of voting rights is fundamental , and the debate over Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure has led to numerous controversies .
<2en> The principle of representation by parliamentarians alone must be forcefully reaffirmed , and the compromise drawn up by the Working Group , which specifies limited cases of difficulty in which voting by non-parliamentarians is permitted , is the final position that we can accept here .
<2en> We need to get through this bad patch .
<2en> This report proposes a few paths that we could take .
<2en> I will only mention some of them , such as a specific instrument to contribute to democracy : the democratic bonus , financial or material aid to improve the functioning of democratically elected parliaments and a better representation of the opposition .
<2en> For the ACP countries , the principle is one country , one vote .
<2en> In fact , each country speaks with just one voice .
<2en> It is impossible for opposition Members of Parliament in the ACP countries to make themselves heard .
<2en> In order to remedy this , we need to have an open debate , without taboos , on the re-weighting of votes .
<2en> For now , the proposal of three delegates per country , put forward by my fellow Member Mr Martinez last year , is heading in the right direction .
<2en> As a result there is the question of funding .
<2en> Following a rigorous financial assessment by the Commission , a special fund would be reserved to cover the travel costs of ACP parliamentary representatives only and for the organisation of sessions .
<2en> From a more general point of view , the JPA is the only assembly that has no budget .
<2en> It should be given new powers to enable it to exercise financial and political control over the funding of cooperation .
<2en> Finally , my last point : the European Parliament should devote special attention to the work of the ACP countries in a comprehensive debate , at least once a year , here in the European Parliament , on the different aspects of cooperation .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for her excellent report .
<en> Mrs Carlotti , your report represents a kind of political road map indicating the route to a genuine parliamentary and democratic assembly .
<en> It contains many helpful proposals for modifications .
<en> So it is a good thing that it is to be adopted before the plenary session in Cape Town and can be taken on board in the discussions there .
<en> Mrs Carlotti has already gone into many of the recommendations contained in the report just now .
<en> As shadow rapporteur , I would like to comment briefly on a few points .
<en> The Cotonou Agreement led to a fundamental reformulation of the goals of cooperation between the EU and the ACP States .
<en> Some of the key substantive and political improvements to that agreement are the result of proposals made by the European Parliament .
<en> Mr Corrie has done excellent work in this area in recent years as co-President .
<en> The result is an ambitious agreement that opens up new horizons for cooperation .
<en> But it now needs to have life breathed into it .
<en> The working methods and procedures of the JPA need to be streamlined and to correspond to a genuine parliamentary , joint , democratic assembly .
<en> This process was initiated last year and needs to be continued .
<en> These new powers should make it possible for the Assembly to exercise tighter financial control over the expenditure of EU development aid .
<en> Stricter monitoring and budgetary control combined with regular contacts between the Members of the Assembly and Members of Parliament from the recipient countries could help to ensure proper use of EU funds in line with the actual needs of the ACP countries .
<en> The report calls for enhanced cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organisations .
<en> In view of the political dimension of the Cotonou Agreement , it seems desirable to establish a dialogue between the public and politicians in the ACP and EU States .
<en> The obstacles in the way of making the JPA a genuine joint parliamentary assembly need to be eliminated as soon as possible .
<en> It is very regrettable that ratification of the agreement in the EU Member States is moving forward at such a sluggish pace .
<en> The risk that this will send the wrong signal to the newly industrialised countries with which the EU has strong historical , political and cultural links should not be underestimated .

<en> Does the House agree to put this compromise amendment to the vote ?
<en> ( Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment )
<en> Regarding Amendment No 52
<sp>
<2en> I have a question , Mr President .
<2en> When did the ' honourable ' Member receive this compromise amendment ?
<sp>
<2en> All the compromise amendments were proposed in one go and given to Mr Radwan at the same time .
<2en> At 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon , he decided to take the first and ninth amendments - you will see in your documents that their numbers have changed - and as for the others , Mr Radwan refused them .
<2en> His two previous comments were made purely and simply in order to manipulate the House .
<sp>
<en> Nevertheless , the House has the right to express itself pursuant to the Rules of Procedure .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the amendment )
<en> Regarding Amendment No 44
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the original proposed amendment increases the thresholds from 10 % to 25 % .
<2en> Having consulted the Commission and the Council and the other groups , we have agreed to reduce this to 20 % .
<2en> I trust that this will not be interpreted as manipulation on my part and that there will be a broad consensus .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to begin by making two declarations of interest .
<en> The first is that I represent Wales in the European Parliament .
<en> Members may know that the risk capital action plan was first adopted at the Cardiff Summit , the capital city of Wales and also the city in which I live .
<en> However , a rather more direct financial interest is that I am a director of the National Farmers ' Union Mutual Insurance Company in the UK , one of the UK 's top ten insurance companies .
<en> I should mention that because some of my remarks will touch upon issues that are relevant in the insurance sector .
<en> I congratulate Mr Skinner for the work he has done on this report .
<en> It is traditional to say that but , in this instance , I really do value the hard work and commitment that he has given .
<en> He is a somewhat solitary figure on that particular side of the House in terms of the need to ensure that we develop the interests of business .
<en> Nonetheless , his is a voice that we welcome .
<en> His report is one that we welcome .
<en> My colleagues and I in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have made some variations to the report which make it even more acceptable .
<en> This report is set within the context - I believe - of some of the failures of the venture capital industry .
<en> There have been such failures .
<en> The venture capital industry has been too focused on areas where there is already significant financial activity .
<en> That is why it is necessary for there to be some guidance in relation to the state aid rules .
<en> But I should like to caution Parliament in the light of some of my own experience of the history of the failure of government-sponsored forays into the whole venture capital area .
<en> First of all , people imagine that if there is some government-sponsored capital scheme it is bound to mean a guarantee of financial support .
<en> Secondly , what are the judgments as to which investments should be backed and which should not ?
<en> Who is making those judgments ?
<en> Thirdly , the effect that there can sometimes be in distorting markets and actually driving good competitors out of business .
<en> These are some of the cautions there may be .
<en> The report we are considering here gets this balance right but we still need to get away from the idea that government , in some sense , can resolve all of these issues .
<en> It is important that we deal with the promotion of entrepreneurship .
<en> We give too much lip service to this without effectively putting it into operation .
<en> In my own country we have Objective I status but getting the people who are involved in putting that plan into operation to recognise the importance of entrepreneurship is very difficult .
<en> Very often we have local and regional administrations run by the public sector who just regard this as yet another income stream .
<en> So there must be guidance in those areas as well .
<en> Finally , I want to make a point about the sources for raising funds .
<en> They are pension funds , banks and insurance companies .
<en> That is something that is recognised by the Commission and Mr Skinner as well .
<en> In this House we have to get away from demonising these organisations .
<en> These organisations are the ones that we look to for the funding to create the dynamic economy that we want to develop in Europe .
<en> There will be two benefits : we will create new businesses and employment opportunities and we will , at the same time , be funding , very often , income for retirement for European citizens .
<en> As a result of that we will be creating a virtuous circle of investment .
<en> That is a message that is not heard often enough in this Chamber .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , without any sense of parliamentary obligation , I shall begin by welcoming Peter Skinner and praise him for the quality and depth of his report which , in fact , obviates the need for me to make specific points on the subject , since he deals with them very well in his report .
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , Europe 's economic recovery , which is absolutely crucial to the Union 's achieving all its political objectives , must depend more on the quality of the policies themselves than on the result of favourable boosts that it receives through recovery in other economic areas .
<2en> In Lisbon , in 2000 , the Union defined the clear and crucial objective of making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 .
<2en> Achieving this objective involves , on the one hand , taking full advantage of all the potential arising from the expansion of the information and knowledge-based society and from the liberalisation of some markets , specifically in the area of energy , and , on the other hand , the definition and implementation of public competition and competitiveness policies that create an environment that favours sustainable economic development .
<2en> A Community-based Europe consists of an economy founded on a commercial framework in which private initiative is dominant and a culture of innovation and risk is an indisputable reality .
<2en> This , therefore , requires the national authorities for political regulation and the appropriate Community institutions to promote and not to hinder all these efforts at innovation .
<2en> The risk capital action plan drawn up at the Lisbon European Council , which called for its full implementation by 2003 , is one of these instruments and certainly one of the most effective instruments available to us .
<2en> It is , therefore , important that it is assessed and that its implementation is monitored , not only to record the progress that is made , but mainly to motivate all the relevant bodies in the Member States and to alert them to the need for the gradual and ongoing pursuit of a healthy entrepreneurial spirit underpinned by a culture in which risk is a factor that is permanently under control .
<2en> The use of risk capital as an instrument to promote investment in new businesses and above all in sectors that face considerable uncertainty at the start of the production process must be stimulated and protected , because the enormous potential that risk capital creates and multiplies is not yet exhausted .
<2en> Nevertheless , as the rapporteur quite rightly points out , this requires a set of measures for legislative harmonisation and the acceptance of policies for fiscal stimulation drawn up by every Member State , but also some suggested by the Union , which will enable us to break down existing barriers in the field of capital provision and , specifically , with regard to the access of small and medium-sized enterprises to this financing instrument .
<2en> By accepting greater responsibility for the financing of risk capital through the European Investment Bank , Europe is demonstrating its desire to unequivocally shoulder its share of responsibility .
<2en> Nevertheless , without precluding access to this form of financing by the high-technology sectors , we must strengthen and develop the appropriate political , economic and institutional framework for the full use of the instrument of risk capital for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> The role of the Commission and of Parliament becomes , in this context , absolutely essential and will certainly be decisive .
<sp>
<2en> Many major technological breakthroughs were made by small-time entrepreneurs with an ingenious streak .
<2en> For example , Philips invented the light bulb at home and Bill Gates started developing software from his garage .
<2en> Needless to say , not every innovation is immediately accessible to the public at large .
<2en> This requires courage , moral fibre , boldness and risk capital .
<2en> In order to allow society to benefit from these innovations , it is important that investments be made .
<2en> These promote the further development of new technology .
<2en> However , many small entrepreneurs do not have these investments at their disposal or have no access to the capital market in order to obtain these resources on favourable conditions .
<2en> It is therefore very important to promote access to risk capital and to remove obstructing rules .
<2en> Based on the fact that , in the past few years , both supply and demand in respect of risk capital for medium-sized and small businesses have been stagnating , it can be concluded that only an approach which removes obstructions both on the supply and on the demand side will be effective .
<2en> In this context , I can hardly see a case for making public funds available , if at all .
<2en> It is mainly up to the Member States to provide sound legislation with regard to the way in which pension funds make the resources entrusted to them profitable .
<2en> Scope to invest in risk capital must be possible under strict conditions , taking into account the risk profile of the funds .
<2en> Pensions should not be put at risk as a result .
<2en> In addition , Member States must ensure that incentives do not ultimately become government support .
<2en> This is undesirable and does not provide incentives to the innovative and creative entrepreneur .
<2en> Nor is it a solution to the substantial problem of an inadequate capital market .
<2en> The incentives should therefore certainly be temporary in nature .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , and those ladies and gentlemen who are not yet present , it is clear to all of us , how significant equity capital and risk capital are in terms of Europe 's achievement of the Lisbon objectives .
<2en> We are glad that clear indications were given in Lisbon of the important role played by efficient risk capital markets in respect of innovative , fast-growing small and medium-sized enterprises and thus also in the creation of new and lasting employment .
<2en> We are very glad that Lisbon saw the renewed demand made for full implementation of the risk capital action plan by 2003 , and that it was made clear that small and medium-sized enterprises are the foundation of technological development and innovation on our continent .
<2en> We are therefore also most heartened by the result showing that venture capital investments in Europe increased in gross volume from EUR 10 billion in 1999 to EUR 19.6 billion in 2000 .
<2en> Despite this report of success , we are saddened by the fact that we are still a long way behind the United States .
<2en> Taken as a share of GDP , venture capital investments in 2000 accounted for only 0.23 % of Europe 's , as against 0.7 % in the United States .
<2en> We must catch up on America , or overtake them , if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives in this area .
<2en> It is also important , in this connection to point out - as my predecessor on the floor has done - that the largest sources of finance are the pension funds , followed by insurance and banks .
<2en> It is , then , all the more regrettable that the Commission proposal for Europe-wide enhancement of occupational retirement provision in the Internal Market as part of the Financial Services Action Plan has to this moment still elicited no official response from the Council , so that we are at the moment unable to negotiate .
<2en> I also regret the fact that we get the feeling that the so-called compromise proposals in the Council cannot and will not be adopted by either Parliament or the Commission , so that Commissioner Bolkestein , who is responsible for these matters , has now felt constrained to say that , if we make no headway here , the need to get things moving would force him to withdraw his Commission proposal .
<2en> The Council 's behaviour also goes against the Barcelona decisions .
<2en> We also know that small and medium-sized enterprises have difficulties when it comes to getting access to capital .
<2en> That is why the Basle Process is so important , as is the fact that the Basle result makes allowances for the private business sector in Europe and does not make access to capital more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> We would , then , also request the Commission , not only to monitor the Basle Process in line with the Barcelona decisions , but also , in the interests of European economic structure and in view of the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises for growth and employment , to actively influence it .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the Skinner report provides a sensible response to the October 2000 Commission communication to implement the risk capital action plan which dates back to the 1998 Cardiff Summit and dovetails neatly with the financial services action plan which Barcelona has made a priority .
<en> SMEs in Europe face much greater difficulties than their US counterparts in raising loan or equity finance , which may help in part to explain the extraordinary success in US economic growth over the last ten years .
<en> Although there is now rapid growth in venture capital funds in the European Union , there is enormous variation in performance .
<en> The City of London , which I proudly represent , leads the way at 0.4 % of UK GDP devoted to this cause .
<en> But even here , most funding comes from US sources .
<en> Pension funds are the prime source of capital , and I have advocated UK-style self-select pension plans for the self-employed being permitted to make such investments on a pan-European basis , although this was rejected in committee , unfortunately .
<en> I agree with the call for US-style EU-wide insolvency laws along the lines of the American Chapter XI bankruptcy procedures which afford a number of advantages , particularly in so far as they do not disrupt the continuity of trading in failing companies .
<en> I also lament the lateness in bringing forward the much-needed Community patent , due to excessive sensitivity on the language issue which will only add to the cost for SMEs and make the procedures unworkable .
<en> Not radically tackling the language issue now will only get worse after enlargement when there are 40 million Polish speakers who also want their language to be given the same priority as , say , Italian or Spanish .
<en> Member States should also seriously consider promotion of funds through generous capital gains tax incentives to mitigate the risk to investors .
<en> I generally , though , reject State funding directly for SMEs as the State is generally poor at picking winners amongst competing demands for capital .
<en> Nevertheless Mr Skinner 's suggestion of a one-stop shop risk capital website to facilitate the interface of SMEs and the finance-providers is a very good one .
<en> This excellent report enjoyed considerable cross-party support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and , in spite of originating from the other side of the House , deserves our full support .

<2en> ( EL ) Pension rights are not being dealt with as a basic requirement of the working classes which the state has a responsibility to satisfy , they are being dealt with as an ' indicator ' , an ' expense ' which undermines the objectives of the stability pact and prevents big business from increasing its profits .
<2en> ' Meeting social objectives ' and maintaining economic viability are being used to promote a policy which tramples all over workers ' social insurance rights in a bid to reduce the price of labour .
<2en> The sole purpose of insurance reforms in the context of capitalist restructuring is to abolish workers ' rights , extend flexible forms of employment and commercialise health and welfare , while the insurance funds gamble their reserves on the stock exchange .
<2en> The need to reduce state expenditure and the need for action to resolve the demographic problem , for which the system and anti-grass roots policies are to blame , are being used as a cover-up in order to abolish basic rights , increase the retirement age , extend working life to lifelong work and convert pensions to welfare benefits , while the problem of unemployment is getting worse and part-time employment is increasing .
<2en> Statements about the dignity and independence of the elderly are hypocritical and misleading , given that 70 % of pensioners live below the poverty line , as are statements about equality of the sexes , because the way is being paved to increase the retirement age of women and abolish the right to early retirement , maternity protection etc .
<2en> We support a social security system which satisfies the needs of the people , with national insurance and a free national health service for everyone , lower retirement ages of 60 for men and 55 for women and 50-55 in professions with serious health risks , shorter insurance periods and full , stable employment .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted against Mr Fatuzzo 's report on safe and sustainable pensions .
<2en> My main criticism is that the report is designed to open the way for a transition from the open coordination method to a Community method in which all the institutions participate fully .
<2en> I believe it would be unfortunate if the open coordination method were to be abandoned through opening the way for a process leading to the Community method 's also being applied in the pensions area .
<2en> Nor is there any support for this in the Treaties .
<2en> I have not therefore been able to vote in favour of the report .
<sp>
<2en> On the pretext of seeking to guarantee ' safe and sustainable pensions ' , the Fatuzzo report subscribes to the liberal ideology of attacking pensions .
<2en> In this report , we are treated to all of the current commonplaces on the subject , the main one being that the pensions problem is above all a demographic issue .
<2en> I do not think that there is a ' pensions problem ' ; the problem which haunts the whole of Europe is above all a problem of unemployment .
<2en> A society of full employment would not have any problems with pensions .
<2en> That is why I am in favour of a massive recruitment policy in the public services and a ban on mass redundancies in profit-making companies , and why I am against a cut in employers ' contributions .
<2en> If we defend pensions , we are defending the interests of the world of work , and an increase in the retirement age , as the Barcelona Summit recently recommended , is unacceptable .
<2en> It is out of the question to attack the pay-as-you-go pension system with pension funds , as has been proposed .
<2en> We are in favour of European workers all contributing for the same period of time , and no pensioner should have a pension that is lower than the minimum wage , which should moreover be increased .
<2en> ( Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) This report is part , in general terms , of the Financial Services Action Plan and the integration of the risk capital markets , as decided at the Lisbon Summit and followed up in Stockholm , with a deadline of 2003 for the integration of the securities markets and of 2005 for the complete integration of the financial markets .
<2en> On the basis of the mystifying idea that venture capital is a means of resolving the financing needs of the SMEs and their start up capital , as if this integration could be a solution to their problems , once again an attempt is being made to move towards an economy increasingly based on finance , by means of the risk capital market and the participation of SMEs in volatile markets , centred largely on the huge pension funds .
<2en> Hence the rapporteur 's call for the liberalisation of pension fund investments in risk capital , favourable tax treatment for the capital gains of SMEs , the protection of the Community patent and tax benefits for fund investments in risk capital schemes .
<2en> For all of these reasons , we voted against the report .
<sp>
<2en> The report seeks to obtain new benefits for capital , an aim which it does its best to dress up with modern justifications .
<2en> It cites the supposed difficulties which start-ups have in obtaining funds , and irresponsibly proposes allowing pension funds to invest in more high-risk projects , even though a considerable amount of money has been swallowed up by the fanciful dreams of the ' new economy ' .
<2en> The report calls for the removal of ' the fiscal , regulatory and administrative barriers ? encountered by new small companies , which - if you believe the report - are capable of closing ' the knowledge gap between Europe and the US ' practically single-handedly .
<2en> The fact that the report stresses the interdependency of risk-capital and the stock exchange shows clearly what this is all about : oiling the wheels of capitalism on the pretext of innovation , and creating a preferential status for small companies , which would allow the large groups to outsource even more of their activities , reduce their taxes and relax the few constraints that the Labour Code still places on them .
<2en> For these reasons , I voted against this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Denmark is not a party to the EU 's regulatory framework on asylum because , in June 1992 , we exercised the people 's democratic right to reject a situation in which the EU would determine the Member States ' asylum regulations .
<2en> It may perhaps serve to stimulate the debate if I state the three main lines of thought behind the Danish ' no ' .
<2en> A few people here in this House , represented by Mr Camre of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , said ' no ' out of a paranoid fear that EU regulations would mean our little country being swamped by asylum seekers .
<2en> Other MEPs , represented by Mrs Frahm from the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left said ' no ' for quite opposite reasons , specifically in order to secure the safety of asylum seekers in the best way possible .
<2en> What now takes the edge right off the Danish ' no ' is the unfortunate fact that xenophobia has in the meantime become the policy of the Danish Government .
<2en> Fortunately , there is , however , a third and democratic ' no ' which is not dependent on political trends .
<2en> Sustainable in the long term , this particular ' no ' is based on the attitude that problems which deeply affect local conditions should be solved in close cooperation with the local communities concerned and not be forced upon us by EU institutions that think they know better .
<2en> The EU 's coercive centralism and mania for making rules quite simply contributes to creating the poisoned breeding ground for demagogues such as Mr Le Pen , Mr Haider and Mr Camre .
<2en> Not that I fail to appreciate the social and economic conditions underlying this shift to the right and this xenophobia , but be in no doubt that the centralised imposition of rules - in which no account is taken of the attitude of the local community - is downright fatal and fosters right-wing extremism .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the right to asylum is a sacrosanct principle of universal law which is acknowledged by all the civilised people in Europe and in the world , but it must be regulated thoroughly if it is not to lose its importance and meaning .
<2en> Those who wish to extend it - and I refer to those who voted through a large number of amendments to the text proposed by the Commission in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs - are certainly not doing any kind of service to the principle of the right to asylum by extending it indiscriminately to people who , in actual fact , are not really entitled to it .
<2en> I refer , in particular , to Amendment No 14 , which seeks to eliminate provision for specific penalties , namely the reducing or withdrawing of reception conditions in the event of an observed infringement of the reception system , and also to a set of amendments - Nos 19 , 21 , 22 , 23 and 34 - seeking to extend the scope of the directives to people requesting protection for reasons other than those listed in the Geneva Convention .
<2en> Do we actually want to reintroduce asylum for economic and social refugees ?
<2en> If we do that , we will be letting at least a billion people into Europe !
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again we find ourselves discussing proposals to establish a common European asylum system .
<2en> What we are also trying to do in this field is to pursue the objective of an area of freedom , security and justice which is open to people who , for various reasons , are legitimately seeking protection in the Community .
<2en> The Tampere conclusions stipulate that a European system of asylum must be established and must include , in the short term , minimum common standards for the reception for asylum applicants .
<2en> These conditions must provide a dignified standard of living and must respect the individual 's fundamental rights .
<2en> The intention is to limit the secondary movements of asylum applicants that are prompted by the differences between the reception conditions provided by the various Member States , thereby ensuring that asylum applicants enjoy a comparable standard of living in all the Member States and that there is a fair spread of efforts between the Member States of the Union .
<2en> I acknowledge that integration into local communities is a complex and difficult matter but this is the approach we must pursue , with its consequences in terms of the right to health , education and employment .
<2en> With regard to the issue of access to the labour market , freedom of access must be allowed , although it is reasonable for this to be made conditional for a period of six months .
<2en> Our rapporteur , Mr Hernández Mollar is right to suggest that we must address this issue seriously and without resorting to populist rhetoric .
<2en> An excessively charitable attitude in these matters only helps those who base their arguments on intolerance , racism and xenophobia .
<2en> This is why it is right , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , to send a message to the benches on the left of Parliament : those who go too far in the field of asylum , as in other areas , become the greatest ally of the forms of extremism they claim to want to combat , for they ultimately stimulate it .
<2en> ( Applause from the right and from the centre )
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for the way he has led this report .
<2en> The miracle he called for will probably not take place , but that will not be because he has not tried to reach an agreement ; he also knows that on some issues I personally was prepared to do so .
<2en> Above all because , on these issues , nobody listens to this Parliament .
<2en> Madam President , take a look at the Council 's benches : there is nobody there ; take a look at the Commission 's benches : I am delighted to share this sitting with Mr Fischler , but I believe that agriculture and fisheries are not exactly what we are talking about .
<2en> I think it is absolutely intolerable that we are debating a report whose departure point we know has been modified by the Council during a period when it is under consultation in this Parliament .
<2en> Madam President , I believe that this is sad and would like to ask you personally to express our concern at this situation .
<2en> The issue we are discussing is extremely serious .
<2en> I believe that the proposals move in the right direction and I also believe that , with regard to some of Parliament 's proposals , the Group of the European Peoples ' Party is not so far from everybody else , although we do have differences of emphasis , such as the absolute importance of correct access for refugees to our society .
<2en> My time is running out , but I would like to reply to Mr Pirker and Mr Coelho : I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that the way to confront the extreme right is not for us to behave in the same way ; that would ultimately mean victory for the extreme right and not failure .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , this debate is proving to be rather heated even in the discussions going on behind the scenes .
<2en> The rapporteur is right : this is no longer his report .
<2en> Proof of this is the fact that it was adopted in committee by 25 votes to 18 , but above all the fact that a good 111 amendments were made to it .
<2en> The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats voted for the motion against its will , and it declared its opposition to all these amendments .
<2en> I therefore urge the rapporteur genuinely to pursue his original position and to treat the report as no longer his own , no longer the work of our group .
<2en> Moreover , just a few days ago , at Valencia , the Council addressed the issue of immigration , discussing matters belonging to the second pillar within the framework of the major field of action - the third pillar - of justice and home affairs .
<2en> It was pointed out that , after the Montpellier talks in May 2000 , a programme should be launched - and the Commission has already put forward a proposal - financed by MEDA , a programme of practical actions in the field of immigration .
<2en> This means that the Council is still at the analysis and assessment stage .
<2en> Proof of this is the fact that , at the suggestion of Italy and Spain - the two countries which are certainly most affected by this issue - it was proposed to hold a ministerial conference on migration next year .
<2en> Well then , while the Council is continuing to pursue a careful and cautious approach , we now want to include measures in a European Parliament report which are so advanced that they consider extending healthcare to all asylum applicants and providing for access to the labour market within four months of lodging an application and admission to school for asylum applicants ' children , under conditions , what is more - and the rapporteur also pointed this out - which are more favourable than those applying to the children of residents .
<2en> Well then , none of this is acceptable , especially not to the countries that are in the eye of the storm as regards asylum applications .
<2en> The constant attempts to overload a report with too many problems make it unacceptable when all is said and done .
<2en> I do not feel that this is the way to help those who are entitled to and need asylum .

<en> Mr President , the trial of Dr Saad Eddin Ibrahim and his colleagues has aroused widespread international interest and concern , not least among those who , like many of us here , consider ourselves true friends of Egypt and the Egyptian people .
<en> When Dr Ibrahim and his co-accused successfully appealed for a retrial last February , we hoped that the best traditions of justice would prevail , not only on the merits of the case , but because of the evident damage to Egypt 's international reputation caused by the handling of the case by the Egyptian authorities .
<en> We were therefore profoundly shocked on 29 July when Dr Ibrahim was again sentenced to seven years ' imprisonment with hard labour , a cruel sentence for a man in his frail physical condition .
<en> A further four defendants were also sentenced to prison and the remaining 24 have suspended sentences .
<en> Even if the charges were credible , and we do not find them so , these sentences are completely disproportionate .
<en> The following day I personally voiced my dismay and repeated that , despite careful monitoring and a mid-term external audit , the Commission has no evidence of financial or other wrongdoings by Dr Ibrahim or his co-defendants with respect to the two NGO contracts managed by them .
<en> We made this clear in an affidavit submitted during the appeal .
<en> Furthermore , I repeated then and I repeat now that we deplore the use of state security courts and procedures to pursue cases of this nature .
<en> Even the Court of Appeal has misgivings on the use of Military Court Order No 4 under which this prosecution was brought .
<en> We were disturbed by the decision to retry the defendants after a successful appeal and despite Dr Ibrahim 's failing health .
<en> We are troubled by the conduct of the trial and the speed and manner of the court 's decision .
<en> This unseemly rush to judgment did nothing to improve the court 's credibility .
<en> The case has been closely followed by the EC and Member States and we made our concern clear at the highest levels from the beginning .
<en> With respect to the charge of accepting foreign European Union funds without authorisation , the Commission insists that direct grants to civil society are perfectly proper and are covered by the EU-Egypt Framework Convention on Financial and Technical Cooperation .
<en> At the conclusion of the first trial last year , the severe sentences led to an EC statement on 23 May and the presidency declaration two days later , expressing deep concern .
<en> Then , as now , the European Union stressed the importance it attaches to the development of civil society and reiterated that actions to this end are an integral part of Barcelona and bilateral programming which Egypt has signed up to .
<en> With respect to the claimed misuse of EU funds , the Commission is , to say the least , surprised that the Court has reportedly ruled as irrelevant the views of the Commission , the alleged victim , that its normal monitoring procedures , including an external mid-term audit , gave no cause for concern whatsoever , financial or otherwise .
<en> We have no access at present to the NGO files , which have been confiscated by the authorities .
<en> The European Union has always hoped that due legal process and justice would prevail .
<en> We have scrupulously avoided any intervention that might prejudice that expectation .
<en> The Commission 's affidavit during the appeal was strictly factual and correct .
<en> We are concerned that the Court , in its written explanations , is reported to have implied the contrary .
<en> The Commission and the Member States continue to follow the case closely .
<en> The Cairo-based Troika has already visited Dr Ibrahim in prison and the Swedes visited again this weekend .
<en> We are in close touch with the family .
<en> If , as first press reports indicate , the Court 's formal explanation of its verdict , which still has to be translated , misrepresents the European Union 's position , we will not hesitate to rectify it .
<en> The legal process is not finished and I understand that the defendants will appeal .
<en> The Egyptian authorities are well aware of the wider implications of a judgment that is perceived as unjust and politically influenced .
<en> Only the due process of law in full transparency can prevent further damage to Egypt 's international standing .
<en> The Ibrahim case raises issues of real concern , but the overall human rights situation in Egypt is complex and not entirely clear .
<en> There is some cause for optimism , for example , in relation to women 's rights , judicial control of general elections and social legislation .
<en> But there are also some signs which give cause for concern , such as the new law on non-governmental organisations , the alleged harassment of homosexuals referred to earlier and the further arrests of members of the Islamic opposition .
<en> What we have to do is discern the trend and react accordingly .
<en> The Ibrahim case casts a long , but hopefully temporary , shadow over the Egyptian human rights and democracy movement .
<en> Although the international outcry at the verdict has provoked a strong reaction in Cairo , many influential Egyptians accept that Egypt must adopt the highest judicial and democratic standards if it is to achieve its developmental and political ambitions .
<en> We can only agree with that .
<en> We will continue to use appropriate measures to express our concern on individual cases .
<en> We shall discuss the broader issues concerning human rights and the promotion of democracy within the context of our cooperation programming and the enhanced political dialogue that must characterise the new and privileged relationship between the European Union and its Mediterranean partners .
<en> I confirm directly to the Member who raised this question that I shall certainly be discussing the matter when , God willing , I visit Egypt myself next month .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much indeed , Commissioner .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place today at 4 p.m. or as soon as we finish the debates .

<en> The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolution on Nigeria , and more specifically the case of Mrs Amina Lawal :

<en> B5-0486 / 2002 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and others , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on human rights breaches in Nigeria .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the African continent , which , for far too long , has been synonymous with tragedies and loss , recently wanted to present a new face to the international community .
<2en> The foundation of the African Union as an off-shoot of the OAU and as a role model to the European Union is a promise of the future for this continent and a homage to the institutions that make up our own .
<2en> As well as providing a model of political structure and a single project for the continent , the European Union must also protect the rights recognised by the international conventions .
<2en> The tragedy of another age , however , currently being suffered by Amina Lawal , is threatening all these promises and signatures ratified by her country , Nigeria .
<2en> The extreme distress experienced by Mrs Lawal and Mrs Husseini before her and so many other ignored voices , is evidence of the ludicrous gap between commitments and political and legal practices in certain countries of Africa .
<2en> It is difficult to understand that , in this day and age , a sentence of death by stoning could be passed down .
<2en> It is difficult to accept such a barbaric act could be carried out for the mere fact of having had a baby after a divorce .
<2en> Above all , it is difficult to accept regional laws , in a federal state which denies and flouts a national constitution .
<2en> Admittedly , it is the primary responsibility of the federal authorities of Nigeria to establish conformity and respect of its national laws and international commitments throughout its territory and the jurisdiction of its state .
<2en> However , it is also the moral and political duty of the Union , many of whose Member States share a common history with the African continent , to oppose criminal abuses , such as certain interpretations of the Sharia law and to support , using every effort and every means at our disposal , those who are fighting for the rule of law , for rights and for real justice for all .
<2en> If we are satisfied with a token statement each time a Kafkaesque crime befalls a citizen of the ACP countries , we are essentially becoming accomplices and are upholding , due to our diplomatic inertia , the return to obscurantist ways .
<2en> That is why my group and I are calling for a working group to be set up on the question of Sharia law and women 's rights as part of our forthcoming ACP-EU delegation .
<2en> The stability of Nigeria is under threat and the stability of the whole country could be affected by what is happening in Nigeria , the most densely populated country in Africa .
<2en> The shockwaves created by Amina Lawal 's case have just reached Europe ; let us take action to prevent further shockwaves in the future .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to express in the strongest terms my horror and disgust at what has been happening over the last two years in the northern provinces of Nigeria , where Islamic fundamentalists have imposed Sharia law over and above the laws of the country and international law .
<2en> I wonder , how can women - not men of course - be condemned to death by stoning for adultery in a country which has ratified the UN treaty on eliminating all forms of discrimination against women , in a country which has ratified the treaty against torture and the international covenant on civil and political rights , in a country with which the European Union has close ties under the Cotonou agreement ?
<2en> How come the federal government of Nigeria is unable to make the Islamic fundamentalists respect the very constitution of the country ?
<2en> What is the point of having a president if he is unable to guarantee the fundamental freedoms and human rights of his citizens ?
<2en> I find it impossible to believe , Commissioner Patten , that intolerance , obscurantism and misogyny can triumph over reason and human values .
<2en> I cannot accept that the Union does not have ways and means of preventing these criminal practices against women and that , in this specific case , we are unable to force the federal government of Nigeria to apply the law throughout its territory .
<2en> We need to send out a very strong message from this House today both to Nigeria and to any other country in which crimes are being committed against women because , as we know from the press , sentences of death by stoning are also passed in Iran .
<2en> We need to tell fundamentalists the world over that no tradition or culture can sanction the violation of the rights of half of mankind , which is why we are calling here and now for Amina Lawal to be released .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Blokland for his excellent work on this report and give my group 's support for the compromise text .
<en> With the toughening of legislation on landfill there has been significant increase in waste incineration , and I know from my own experience in my constituency in Wales that incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is as much a concern , in terms of its effects on health and the environment , as is landfill .
<en> It is essential that we do not replace one unhealthy and unsustainable form of waste disposal with another .
<en> Incineration is not recycling .
<en> It is not a clean and safe method of waste disposal .
<en> Genuinely sustainable alternatives must be funded and promoted and far more must be invested in research and in developing waste prevention , re-use and recycling .
<en> That is why I welcome these standards for co-incineration of municipal waste and the transportation of waste , which should help bring an end to the present trade in waste where areas with the cheapest operators and the lowest standards become the co-incineration capitals of Europe .
<en> In particular , I welcome the commitment to improving public access to information on incineration plants and the obligation on plant operators to publish an annual report on emissions .
<en> Greater openness is obviously of major concern to people who live near these incinerators , but it will also help to ensure that the plant operators themselves keep below the emission ceilings that have been set .
<en> The introduction of much stricter nitrogen oxide limits for new co-incineration plants such as cement kilns is also a step forward which will be an incentive for reducing emissions even though the standards proposed do not reflect the best available techniques .
<en> Overall , this much needed legislation will put in place safeguards to limit the worst effects of incineration on health and the environment and , I hope , discourage incineration-for-profit , which depends on the creation of more and more waste .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Blokland in particular for his cooperation during this process .
<en> Agreement on the derogations in the scope of the directive was one of the hardest questions in the debate and conciliation process .
<en> The aim was for strictly limited derogations and the clearest possible definitions .
<en> In my opinion this has been successful , meaning that ecological targets and compatibility with other Community policies can come about in what is actually an easily realisable way .
<en> Parliament was also pushing for greater transparency and better opportunities for the public to have access to information .
<en> Thus , in the conciliation process we were able to agree that plants that incinerate more than two tons per hour should publish a report on their emissions each year and smaller incineration plants should be included in the lists that would come under public scrutiny .
<en> The limit values for emissions in the annex to the directive were definitely the most difficult point .
<en> In this respect the conciliation process achieved a good result , as Parliament ' s proposal for stricter nitrogen oxide emissions in all new cement kilns co-incinerating waste was approved .
<en> I myself succeeded in having some amendments made to the report , vital for the continuation of co-incineration practices that have been in place in Finland for years and which are more ecological than those contained in the directive that is now about to be approved .
<en> I am very happy about that , as the job I had as a new member having come directly to the second reading was not easy .
<en> The report by Mr Blokland , now at its third reading , was for many members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , elected to Parliament for the first time , the first real test of learning with regard to parliamentary practice .
<en> The procedures chosen by the institutions work surprisingly well , however .
<en> The end result can be considered good , and with good reason .
<en> The important element in all this , though , was the genuine desire for cooperation on the part of the three institutions .
<en> The work of the countries to hold the presidency , Portugal and France , was constructive , and we have to mention in particular the role of the Commission , which played a decisive part in bringing about a satisfactory end result .
<en> In my opinion , there is something to be learnt from this for the future and we must see to it that cooperation to achieve a more ecological European Union works .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , honourable Members , forgive me - especially Mr Blokland - for being a few minutes late .
<en> I could not hear your introduction , but I can guess what was in it .
<en> First of all , I want to thank you for your excellent work as rapporteur on this report .
<en> The fact that this directive has passed through the legislative procedure so smoothly serves to show how important it is for all concerned .
<en> This directive will lead to significant reductions in emissions in several key pollutants across the European Union , despite the fact that the volume of waste incineration will increase over the coming years .
<en> Not only does it contribute to the fight against air pollution but it also covers the release of waste water , as Mr Lund has said , from exhaust gas cleaning and the quality of waste from the incineration process itself .
<en> The conciliation process was demanding , but a well-balanced compromise has been found and the amendments of Parliament and the Council have produced a better directive .
<en> The scope of the directive is much clearer .
<en> Public access to information has improved .
<en> Stricter emission-limit values have been introduced for new cement kilns that co-incinerate waste , as Mrs Evans pointed out .
<en> This has been largely due to the excellent work of the European Parliament and its rapporteur , Mr Blokland .
<en> I am convinced that the joint text strikes the right balance - a view reflected in your speeches yesterday - incorporating a high level of environmental protection along with the legitimate interests of all stake holders .
<en> Let me remind you that the directive is only one instrument in the whole waste-management concept of the Commission .
<en> Burning waste is the final stage in the treatment of waste , due to the waste hierarchy , and the Commission will make strong efforts to reduce and recycle waste and in its approach to an integrated product policy .
<en> Of course , the overall objective is to prevent waste in the first place .
<en> In conclusion , this directive is a major contribution to the reduction of negative effects on the environment and the risks they pose to human health .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Commissioner .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I feel that Mr Galeote has made personal comments about me , in my capacity as President of the Spanish Socialists in this House .
<2en> I would ask him to withdraw his falsities and slurs .
<2en> I really do not understand Mr Galeote .
<2en> I do not understand why Mr Galeote is determined to turn a European debate into a Spanish debate .
<2en> I do not understand why he provokes us , I do not understand this narrow nationalist attitude , trying to bring about a debate amongst Spaniards , when what we should do is resolve - as the Commissioner has said - a problem which is European and which should be resolved from a European perspective .
<2en> However , Mr Galeote , from one Spaniard to another , I will define what I think of your attitude by means of two traditional sayings .
<2en> The first is that ' offence is not caused by those who want to but by those who can ' , and the second , which is also very traditional and descriptive , because we all have memories and we all have history , Mr Galeote , is that ' the thief believes that everybody is like him ' .
<2en> History has recorded what your attitudes have been and what our attitudes have been and still are , the attitudes of the Spanish Socialists here in this Parliament and those of the Spanish Socialists down there , in the Spanish Parliament .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Díez , you felt that personal comments were made about you and the Presidency has given you the floor .
<en> Perhaps the second of your sayings , although the Presidency understands what you mean by it , contains a word which perhaps , for the sake of parliamentary courtesy , you should also withdraw , Mrs Díez .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , a saying is a saying .
<2en> In no way have I tried to call Mr Galeote a thief .
<2en> It is a saying which means : everybody believes that others are like them .
<2en> He has accused us of dishonest conduct , which has never been the case , and he knows that there has been dishonest conduct in his ranks .
<sp>
<en> The Presidency is grateful for this clarification , Mrs Díez , which restores our sense of parliamentary courtesy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mrs Díez , of course I would withdraw any type of insult or slur in my speech , if I could , and I would challenge you to read the verbatim report for this sitting and tell me whether it contains any insult or slur , because I will withdraw them without question .
<2en> What I want to say , Mr President and Mrs Díez , is that committees of inquiry are laid down in Rule 151 of our Rules of Procedure - I would ask you to read them , please .
<2en> And this request to create a committee of this type is justified by non-compliance with Community law , and it has been said here , explicitly and literally , by some of your colleagues and compatriots , that the intention through this committee is to establish the responsibilities of the Spanish Government in relation to the Prestige disaster .
<2en> This has been said here , literally .
<2en> What I am saying is that you cannot say in Spain that we are going together to ask for more funds and then say here that the funds should not be given because the Spanish Government is at fault .
<2en> That is what I meant .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in making out that it is a champion of human rights , the European Union tailors them to its needs .
<2en> It has no problem , for example , defending the rights of homosexuals , but has nothing to say about the right to a job , to health care , to an education , to culture or to sport .
<2en> At the same time , it systematically encourages existing democratic rights to be undermined or abolished , using terrorism and illegal immigration as its pretext .
<2en> The European Union 's version of human rights is set out in the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights which the Communist Party of Greece has denounced as inadequate and misleading .
<2en> The report measures human rights against this charter , which is why there is not the slightest reference to the slavery introduced with new forms of work and to the decimation and commercialisation of social benefits .
<2en> It has no objection to the plethora of new terrorist laws and it ignores the personal electronic files kept by the Schengen system and the fact that ideas which upset the system are passed over , distorted or even expelled and persecuted .
<2en> The good thing about the report , however , is that it identifies a whole series of infringements , such as the torture of prisoners , trafficking in human beings and the suppression of rights in Genoa .
<2en> Another good thing is that it calls for church and state to be separated , criticises child labour , highlights the adverse impact of measures to combat terrorism and asylum and immigration laws and discusses the social emancipation of women .
<2en> Neither the situation on the ground nor the report , however , are of any benefit to the European Union and improvements will only come about if the grass-roots movement steps up its fight .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of today 's debate lies in Article 6º of the Treaty of European Union itself , which states that the Union is founded on the principles of freedom , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law , principles which are common to the Member States .
<2en> In other words , European integration has been achieved on the basis of fully respecting , guaranteeing and promoting fundamental and human rights , in which the well-being and dignity of its citizens must be the inspiration and goal for every and any action taken by any Member State and by the Community institutions .
<2en> Hence the importance of the European Parliament 's Annual Report on Human Rights , which has provided the ideal opportunity to take a close look at the EU 's human rights policy , within the Union and beyond it , and at the role that the European Parliament has played , of which we can be proud .
<2en> Hence my disappointment with the report that has been presented ; with its lack of balance and rigor .
<2en> The report presented to us last year by Mr Cornillet was rich in ideas and analysis and constituted a milestone and an extremely positive step towards defining a methodology for monitoring and evaluation , which should underpin any human rights policy , based of course on the European Charter covering these rights .
<2en> Whilst containing aspects that deserve our support , such as the issues of terrorism , trafficking in human beings and human rights and the highly topical problem of achieving the necessary balance between security and human rights , the report we have been presented with this year , however , gives way in some points to demagogy and generally shies away from the rigorous principles which a resolution adopted by the European Parliament should uphold .
<2en> This is why , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree more with the text of the alternative resolution tabled by Mr Ribeiro Castro , which shall have my vote .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I personally am very happy that Mrs Swiebel 's report sums up the human rights situation in the European Union and even within the Member States .
<2en> I believe it to be a cornerstone of the work of this Parliament because it enables us to take a step back , which is so unusual here , and consider a clear , coherent policy with specific actions to achieve the goals we proclaim so often .
<2en> I shall not insult you by citing the various conventions and treaties that we must observe or by restating our will to anchor the Charter of Fundamental Rights unconditionally in European consciousness in order to establish the rights and freedoms of these European citizens .
<2en> Each year , however , when we draw up a report on human rights , when we lament the violations that have taken place , when we adopt resolutions , we only talk about third countries .
<2en> How can we have credibility and impose these rights in our relations with these countries , if we ourselves do not respect them ?
<2en> Some Members here will be horrified at the thought of naming certain countries in this report .
<2en> We must not , however , shy away from this .
<2en> As democrats , we are representatives of our citizens ; we are not protectors of the policies of our national governments .
<2en> We must confirm , here in Parliament , that the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in the European Union is more than just words ; it affects every aspect of life , for all human beings , wherever they may be , whether or not they live in an area of freedom .
<2en> Defending human rights is a duty and a right which must not be hampered by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the Member States .
<2en> The purpose of this report is therefore to assess the situation .
<2en> It is our role to act if this situation does not satisfy us , so that these fundamental rights might be a fact of everyday life in our own Member States .
<2en> I shall end on two points : first , I am very happy that economic and social rights are assessed at European level and I believe this Convention should take inspiration from that .
<2en> I would then ask our Member States to do what it takes to establish clear statistics , sorted by gender , in every area , and provide them to our next rapporteurs .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in common with the EU Member States , the European Parliament has a responsibility to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights .
<2en> At the same time , there is a dangerous tendency to put democratic freedoms such as freedom of expression and thought and the freedom to vote , on an equal footing with far-reaching social requirements .
<2en> This weakens the basis of democracy .
<2en> If all rights are equally important , no right is in the end especially important .
<2en> An annual report by the European Parliament is of doubtful value if it is a spectrum of subjective views .
<2en> Political wish lists easily result in new topics being lighted upon instead of there being a focus upon the really fundamental rights .
<2en> In tackling these issues from a perspective other than that of this broad spectrum of views , I am amazed that there are no rights to good governance and democratic elections .
<2en> These rights should be more to the point than many of those included in the report .
<2en> It has become apparent that existing Member States too need to be reminded of them .
<2en> The EU should impose sanctions on Member States that fail to uphold democratic elections and in which there is proven electoral fraud .
<2en> The Convention should reflect upon these issues .
<2en> There are , however , positive new things in the report worth mentioning .
<2en> Data protection and transparency are included .
<2en> Rights to these must be developed in the Treaty .
<2en> Data protection and the right of access to documents are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<2en> The time is now ripe for citizens ' right to information under Article 255 of the Treaty to be made more specific .
<2en> In conclusion , the European Parliament has an important role to play in issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights .
<2en> I hope that the Convention consolidates this role by creating a democratic system of decision-making and a right for people to go to court and , in certain cases , obtain damages if their rights have been infringed .
<2en> The issue clearly needs to be explored further .
<2en> Mrs Swiebel has made this clear .
<2en> That is good , but there should preferably be a more concentrated approach next time , with the issue explored more deeply rather than just broadened out .
<2en> We must clearly develop our methods for the future .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I want to begin by thanking my colleague , Mrs Swiebel for the sterling work she has done on this report .
<2en> There is no doubt that we in the EU are well off when it comes to respect for freedoms and rights .
<2en> That is precisely why we are having this debate , that is to say with a view to constantly improving the situation , retaining a high level of protection and openly debating the deficiencies that exist .
<2en> It is an important issue that affects what is most basic to a properly functioning EU - mutual trust between the Member States .
<2en> We are not perfect .
<2en> Rights are infringed , and there are failures to respect fundamental freedoms and rights , and it is not just ' everywhere else ' that these things happen .
<2en> My own country , Sweden , has , for example , been singled out in connection with a high-profile death in which the actions of the police , prosecution service and coroner have been sharply criticised .
<2en> I want to make it clear that the Swedish Government had been responding to the criticism for a long time and had instituted an inquiry that was completed last year .
<2en> The perspectives from which the inquiry was conducted clearly included that of citizens ' rights .
<2en> Another very important issue is that of the rights of European citizens in legal processes such as arrests .
<2en> There are Member States in which people are held without trial for long periods ; we must debate this issue .
<2en> Our young people travel throughout Europe .
<2en> No one on EU territory should need to feel anxious that their personal freedom may be infringed because of inefficiency at police stations and in prisons .
<2en> We must therefore emphasise very clearly that all European citizens are guaranteed certain rights in legal processes in all the EU countries .
<2en> I look forward to the Commission 's continued work on this issue and to its proposals .
<2en> Trafficking in human beings , particularly women and children , is a fact in this EU of ours .
<2en> The EU is in many cases the final destination for people who , in desperation and confusion , are taken away from their home countries .
<2en> It is a modern slave trade , and we must ask ourselves how that trend can be stopped .
<2en> I am concerned about the fact that many EU countries accept various forms of prostitution .
<2en> It turns the EU into a favourable market for traffickers in human beings throughout the world .
<2en> There is an unambiguous link between human trafficking and prostitution .
<2en> They are two sides of the same coin .
<2en> I should have liked to have seen the report be clearer on this point .
<2en> We must make great demands of ourselves in the EU , now that we are making demands of the candidate countries .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , as has already been said , by just five votes Parliament has provided the news reports with one of the most disappointing and shameful pages on our work in this forum : a report entitled ' on the human rights situation in the European Union ' and which , on the contrary , has violated , or is violating , many of the rights which most affect citizens .
<2en> Let us consider one of many : the institution of the family , which is , to say the least , distorted by this report ; a family model which proposes the free union between men or women of the same sex and liberalised single-parent or , precisely , homosexual , adoption laws .
<2en> And furthermore , a country is put forward as a model - the Netherlands to be exact - which , in addition to these things , has official euthanasia and liberalised drug policies .
<2en> Well , if this is the social model which is now coming out of Parliament , I dissociate myself from it and - here lies the weak spot - the majority of Member States dissociate themselves from it too : only two or three indirectly follow the Dutch model .
<2en> There will now be an institutional deadlock , because neither the Commission nor the Council - they have already announced this - are willing to accept this trend .
<2en> We have missed an opportunity to be clearer and more coherent .

<en> The British Labour members and I have voted in favour of the Swiebel report , which as a whole serves a valuable purpose .
<en> All Member States must , by their very nature , be strong and confident enough to accept criticism .
<en> This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid .
<en> The report is based on second-hand information from NGOs and other organisations .
<en> A number of factual inaccuracies have therefore crept in .
<en> The UK takes very seriously all allegations of violence and racism by public servants .
<en> Any allegations are rigorously investigated and prosecutions sought .
<en> The detention of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism is a very serious matter .
<en> However , exceptional measures are sometimes necessary to deal with potential threats to national security .
<en> The 1951 Geneva Convention was surely never intended to give protection to terrorists ; it is therefore right that they should be excluded .
<en> Whilst not perfect , UK legislation seeks to promote the rights of workers and encourages employers to treat employees with due consideration at all times .
<en> They also have access to legal redress if appropriate .
<en> With respect to maternity rights in the UK , all pregnant women are entitled to 18 weeks leave , which may begin up to 11 weeks before the birth of the child .
<en> So we have reservations about the accuracy of the report but we welcome it and have voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> ? he motion on fundamental rights in the European Union is , generally speaking , a good motion .
<2en> However , there are several problem paragraphs , such as paragraph 78 on the ban on women entering Mount Athos .
<2en> I do not think it is against this criterion that women 's rights will be measured ; they will be measured in terms of employment , equal pay , domestic violence and the fight against trafficking in human beings .
<2en> We can hardly talk about freedom of movement on this tiny strip of land which has its own sense of time and observes customs and traditions which date back thousands of years .
<2en> Soon we will be calling for freedom of establishment and freedom of business activity and the monasteries will be overrun with Coca-Cola stands .
<2en> In an increasingly plastic and homogenised world , we should respect the cultural wealth which comes down from the past , without affecting modern society , and leave Mount Athos to travel through time at its own pace .
<2en> It is because of paragraph 78 that I am forced to vote against the report as a whole .
<sp>
<2en> We Swedish Social Democrats present this explanation of vote concerning the following points :
<2en> Item 23 :
<2en> We are against using the expression , ' forced prostitution ' .
<2en> Our view is that prostitution is always forced .
<2en> Behind prostitution , there is always compulsion , dependency and exploitation .
<2en> There can be no talk of voluntary prostitution and therefore no talk of forced prostitution either .
<2en> Item 67 :
<2en> We believe that Sweden should sign ILO Convention No 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples .
<2en> Signing up to the convention requires adjustments to Swedish law , however .
<2en> For example , the extent of the land that the Lapps have traditionally used or been in possession of has to be clearly identified .
<2en> The task of establishing the extent of these areas has been entrusted by the government to a special commission that exists for the purpose of setting the limits of the reindeer breeding area .
<2en> The inquiry must be completed by the end of 2004 and will then have to be referred for consultation .
<2en> It means that it will be some years before Swedish ratification is possible .
<2en> Item 133 :
<2en> In the justification of item 133 , Sweden is singled out in connection with two deaths that have attracted attention and in connection with which the police 's , the prosecution service 's and the coroner 's actions have been sharply criticised .
<2en> We wish to make it clear that the Swedish Government responded to the criticism and set up an inquiry that was completed last year .
<2en> The inquiry was conducted expressly from the point of view of citizens ' rights and is critical of a variety of aspects of the criminal inquiry .
<sp>
<2en> - ( IT ) The defence of fundamental rights cannot and must not become the ideological flag of any particular group , but must be the joint heritage of all citizens .
<2en> Reading the pages of the Swiebel Report , however , it can be inferred that this important commitment to everybody 's rights is being transformed into an accusation against some quarters : in particular Italy and those who , in Italy , took the liberty of voting against the rapporteur 's wishes .
<2en> Also with regard to defence of the family and related values , the report takes a one-sided , prejudiced view , which is certainly legitimate for a political group , but which cannot and must not become a common position of the European Union .
<2en> Apart from religious aspects - which , nevertheless , cannot be completely overlooked , given the importance attached to Christian culture in Europe - the report completely ignores the great social and educational value undeniably inherent in the traditional couple , intended as a basic cell in the connective tissue of society .
<2en> Defence of the right of individuals to conduct their relationships in their preferred manner is sacrosanct , but the European institutions cannot , in my view , equate these relationships with the social institution of the family in its traditional meaning .
<2en> ( Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> For those people who might be confused by the word ' forced ' , it refers , of course , to prostitution and not to child labour .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in the light of current events , could Burma - or Myanmar - also be included on the list of countries cited as examples ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , given that , despite worldwide protests , including protests from the European Parliament in December , a Tibetan was executed by order of a Chinese court four days ago and the same fate awaits a highly respected lama , I ask the House to agree to a motion going further than proposal No 8 from the Greens and Non-attached Members .
<2en> I propose adding the following to item 16 :
<2en> ' condemns in the strongest terms the execution of the Tibetan Lobsang Dhondup on 26 January for alleged political crimes and calls for the immediate setting aside of the death sentence on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek ' .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I wish to point out that part of paragraph 16 is missing in the Spanish version .
<2en> I believe your attention has already been drawn to this omission , but I would like this to be noted in the Minutes .
<sp>
<en> Thank you for drawing that to our attention .
<en> Once again , we will ensure that all the language versions correspond .

<en> Motion for a resolution ( B5-0053 / 2003 ) tabled by John Corrie and Thierry Cornillet on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , to wind up the debate on the Council and Commission statements on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo
<en> Before the vote on paragraph 4 :
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the majority of British Labour Members , myself included , have abstained on the Santini report .
<en> Although we support its fundamental objectives , which serve a sound purpose , we are concerned that , as the report stands , the provisions designed to reach this valuable goal do not include sufficient guarantees against potential exploitation by criminal gangs and those seeking to enter the EU illegally .
<en> We do not , for example , accept the need to do away with documentary evidence proving family relationship .
<en> Furthermore , whilst we wish to protect the rights of unmarried and same-sex partners , we cannot allow a situation to arise where the unmarried partners of EU nationals could have greater rights to enter a Member State than the nationals of that country .
<en> Moreover , there must be safeguards to ensure that we do not encourage the use of marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry .
<en> The provisions which seek to soften the economic conditions attached to residence in exceptional circumstances need more work and clarification before a further reading .
<en> Finally , we do not accept the provision in Article 26 ( 2 ) which would prevent Member States from expelling permanent residents in exceptional circumstances .
<en> This power is rarely used , but we must reserve the right to use it for serious breaches of public security .
<sp>
<2en> ( EL ) The motion to allow European citizens freedom of movement and residence on Community territory is on the right track , which is why I support it .
<2en> It gives citizens greater opportunity to exercise their right to move freely throughout the Community by calling for procedures to be simplified and pared down .
<2en> Of course , making over six months ' residence dependent on financial resources could give rise to social discrimination .
<2en> Now that the definition of the family has been extended to same sex or unmarried partners , the directive reflects the diversity of family relationships in today 's society more closely .
<2en> Finally , greater flexibility is needed for students studying abroad ; with the length of time studying takes nowadays , this could be considered as a reason for obtaining a residence permit .
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) The proposal for a directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States is gradually changing all aspects of the meaning of this right .
<2en> In fact , according to the Treaty , it means that the citizens of each Member State may in principle move or reside in the territory of other Member States , but it does not mean that the States of residence have no right of control or right of justified refusal .
<2en> The directive proposed by the Commission , however , switches from one meaning to the other , taking the case-law of the Court of Justice as a basis but going beyond it , without the necessary adjustments being made in the Treaty after democratic debate .
<2en> This text would take power away from the Member States and make them lose a little more of the control of their territory , which we refuse to accept .
<2en> Even the French Government , although it is generally indulgent towards the Community institutions , has protested in particular against the suppression , laid down by the directive , of the right to expel a Community national after a permanent stay of four years .
<2en> On these grounds , we voted against this text .
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) The right to free movement within the territory of the Member States was in principle decided when the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 and was due to enter into force at the same time as the Treaty .
<2en> The simple fact that , 45 years later , we still need to vote on resolutions so that this right can come into play is truly a sign that , for those taking the decisions on European unity , the only thing that counts is free movement of capital and goods , not citizens ' rights .
<2en> Even in the proposal for a directive , this right is partial and its limits carefully defined .
<2en> For example , it will be the responsibility of the Member State of residence to determine whether or not it intends to provide social aid or student grants .
<2en> This , however , does not prevent us from constantly talking about European citizenship !
<2en> We voted in favour of this report , however , because its recommendations would considerably improve the directive currently being prepared on citizens ' right to move and reside within the territory of the European Union , in particular with regard to the rights of spouses and children .
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) I welcome the improvements being made to the situation of EU citizens who wish to settle in another Member State of the Union , in particular reducing the bureaucracy that currently proliferates .
<2en> On the basis of the proposal for a directive put forward by the European Commission , it will now be possible for an EU citizen to remain on the territory of another Member State without having to comply with any formalities , for a period of six months and not only three months , which is the current requirement .
<2en> For stays of more than six months , if a Union citizen is engaged in a gainful activity , he is simply required to make a declaration to that effect .
<2en> If he is not engaged in a gainful activity , he is obliged to declare that he has sufficient resources and Member States may not fix any threshold for this .
<2en> He must also take out sickness insurance cover for his first four years of residence .
<2en> The right to permanent residence at the end of these four years is the major innovation introduced by the directive and consists of the fact that this right is granted to the European citizen and to the members of his / her family .
<2en> The report makes some positive improvements , widening the concept of the family , eliminating or simplifying some bureaucracy , and guaranteeing more rights than those planned initially .
<2en> Hence our vote in favour .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the question of the European Union 's borders is very interesting and has also been discussed by the European Convention .
<2en> Yesterday the Commission adopted a strategy for a good neighbourly relations policy which also lists those countries covered by the policy .
<2en> Is any significance to be attached to this strategic proposal by the Commission given that we are discussing the possible decision at the Thessaloniki Summit to open negotiations with the new candidate countries ?
<2en> In other words I am asking what the relation is between this strategy for a good neighbourly relations policy and the new , possibly to be called candidate , countries ?
<2en> Is the purpose of the neighbourly relations policy to specify which regions and states can never join the Union , or , in other words , is this in fact a matter of defining the Union 's borders ?
<sp>
<2en> Thank you for your question , because I think this issue needs to be clarified .
<2en> By definition , enlargement changes the borders of the European Union , and what we want to emphasise is that these borders will operate not as new Berlin walls , but as bridges for cooperation .
<2en> Bridges for cooperation , of course , based on our common values , our objectives for democracy , freedom , respect for human rights , economic and cultural relations , security , our approach to organised crime and joint cooperation with this region as a whole , our common region which extends from Russia to the Mediterranean .
<2en> The Commission , therefore , has a role to play and we have asked the Commission in repeated debates in the Council to come forward with a proposal for this new common region and how these bridges for cooperation with our neighbours can be strengthened ; however , this has not been linked with candidates ' prospects .
<2en> As I said to the previous speaker , this is a serious problem and a broad dialogue has been opened on the issue ; I think you also mentioned it and it has been discussed at the Convention , but we have not taken any decisions .
<2en> So yes , the Commission has prepared a text and it will be discussed at the European Conference in Athens the day after the signing ceremony with the ten new countries .
<2en> This conference will be attended by some 40 countries , but not as prospective candidates .
<2en> That is a separate issue .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , Croatia 's application for membership represents a further step towards the stabilisation of this region .
<en> Just in the last few minutes we have received bad news from Serbia .
<en> A state of emergency was declared there a few minutes ago following the assassination of Prime Minister Djindjic .
<en> I would be interested to know if you intend to convene an emergency meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council , given that this development really does give us great cause for concern .
<sp>
<2en> If I have understood correctly , you asked if we shall convene an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council in the wake of developments in Serbia .
<2en> First of all , as I said earlier , we have condemned this incident and expressed our sorrow .
<2en> However , I think that developments in this country are developments in which we have invested a great deal ; we have concerned ourselves with the future of Serbia and Montenegro and the region as a whole for many years now and we are committed to efforts to maintain and guarantee permanent stability , peace and democratic institutions there .
<2en> This is the message which the presidency is sending Serbia and the Serbian nation and the region as a whole today , and we shall do everything we can to help in this direction .
<2en> We are due to hold a Council of Ministers very shortly , within the next few days , so I see no reason to convene an extraordinary Council ; it might even generate certain fears .
<2en> We do not think that this incident should cause any internal disruption , over and above sorrow and shock .
<2en> It is on our agenda and we shall take measures over the next few days if any special support is needed .
<sp>
<en> Questions No 10 and 23 have been withdrawn .
<en> As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed , Questions Nos 11 to 22 and 24 to 49 will be replied to in writing
<en> That concludes Questions to the Council .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> ( NL ) Today we have to choose a new president of the European Central Bank , but there is not really any choice at all .
<2en> From the outset the intention was for the bank to be located in Germany with a Frenchman at the helm .
<2en> As the Dutchman Wim Duisenberg had done the groundwork for the ECB , he was ultimately given the presidency for a short time .
<2en> It was known when he was appointed that a compromise had been reached in which the eight-year term would be shared between Mr Duisenberg and Mr Trichet .
<2en> Mr Trichet was thus assured of this post , albeit for only half the period , from the start .
<2en> That threatened to go awry when it looked as if Mr Trichet was going to go to prison .
<2en> It has now been suggested that he be given a further period of eight years .
<2en> As an argument in favour of his appointment it is now being said that , unlike the government in his country , he will adhere strictly to the 3 % ceiling for national budget deficits in the Stability Pact .
<2en> That ceiling is turning into a recipe for disaster .
<2en> Large Member States are not managing to achieve it ; poor Member States will certainly not be able to .
<2en> In the Netherlands , which is adhering to it , everything that is valuable is being cut back to nothing .
<2en> Against this background I see no reason whatsoever to approve the candidature of Mr Trichet .
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) The appointment of the next president of the European Central Bank is an act of the utmost importance because , in addition to the personality of the candidate , it is also , and above all , on monetary policy that we should comment .
<2en> In the event , although I am clearly pleased that a Frenchman is soon to become president of the ECB , I cannot avoid the fact that Mr Trichet , for he is the person we are discussing , embodies a strict budgetary orthodoxy and demands that this be implemented .
<2en> Mr Trichet put this quite bluntly during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs : come hell or high water , he intends to continue the approach he has inherited from Mr Duisenberg , in other words , a form of monetarism that is as rigid as it is inappropriate .
<2en> This decision should not be endorsed , however .
<2en> At a time when many Member States are unable to comply with a Stability Pact , the limitations of which appear , in the current situation , to be completely out of step with the harsh realities of the economic climate , I cannot sanction the appointment of a candidate who is clearly afflicted by the same disease : autism .
<sp>
<en> I voted in favour of confirming Mr Trichet as President of the European Central Bank because it is in my country 's and my constituents ' interest that the ECB be well managed and that the euro succeed as a currency .
<en> The euro zone is by far the most important destination for Scottish exports and source of our imports and tourists .
<en> I am adequately persuaded by Mr Trichet 's reputation , and by the way he responded to the questions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , that he will maintain the stability of the euro .
<en> He will also maintain the requisite pressure on the Member States to pursue prudent financial policies and to reform their social structures in order to foster economic growth and development .
<en> This is what matters to Scotland .
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) Unemployment is one of the main problems facing the candidate countries .
<2en> In six of the 12 candidate countries , unemployment exceeds 10 % , leading to social exclusion and poverty .
<2en> Economic and monetary policies promoting economic growth and employment are needed , therefore , and should be driven by the public and cooperative sectors .
<2en> This unemployment can be blamed on the rapid destruction of planned economies , linked to waves of privatisation and the complete opening-up of markets , which have caused severe disruption not only of economic activity but also of public services themselves , in particular in the field of social security .
<2en> This very transformation is confirmed in the report 's explanatory statement , where it is said to have ' further increased the proportion of the population who are threatened with poverty ' and caused the rise of ' employment on insecure terms , e.g. on a temporary ? basis ' .
<2en> This Commission communication , then , aims to transpose the European Employment Strategy , in its ' post-Lisbon strategy ' form , to the candidate countries .
<2en> The latter do not appear to require greater occupational flexibility and mobility .
<2en> Once again , the solution lies in a thorough revision of the EU 's entrenched neoliberal economic and monetary policies .
<2en> The EU 's efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion should be redoubled .
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) I voted in favour of this report on the Commission 's communication on the progress made by the candidate countries in relation to their respective employment policies .
<2en> Its aim is to ensure that the candidate countries define employment policies which prepare them for EU membership .
<2en> As we know , employment , employment policies and their coordination constitute one of the main challenges facing the EU today .
<2en> Above all , it is one of the demands of the people of Europe .
<2en> The Lisbon strategy , indeed , defined the challenge of creating more and better jobs as essential to promoting truly humane progress , concerned not only with questions of economic growth , but also with the individual fulfilment of its citizens .
<2en> Among the central messages of the European Commission 's communication , I would emphasise those which lay particular emphasis on the strategic significance of education and training , from basic level up to the increasingly important lifelong learning .
<2en> Lastly , I would also like to mention the importance attached to special programmes on equal treatment for disabled people and provisions to promote equal opportunities .
<2en> These measures make it possible to reconcile family life with a professional career .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , a dispute has arisen in Italy , to be specific in my region , the Trentino-Alto Adige / South Tyrol , regarding the ethno-linguistic census organised under the region ’ s statute of special autonomy and assiduously carried out by the German-speaking administration .
<2en> This census runs counter to the principle of free movement as well as to Directive 95 / 46 / EC on the protection of personal data and in particular to Article 8 protecting the ethnic origin of citizens .
<2en> Whilst possible infringement proceedings are underway against the Italian State , it seems that Commissioner Bolkestein directly agreed to a solution with the Governor of the Province of Bolzano , as the President himself announced after returning from a trip to Brussels .
<2en> Considering that the Italian Government , which is responsible for this kind of negotiation , has already made an official protest , I would be pleased to know from Commissioner Bolkestein what the tenor of this meeting was : if it is true that a solution was agreed to or if the issue was simply discussed .
<sp>
<2en> – I see that Commissioner Bolkestein is here .
<2en> He may choose to respond to your question at some other moment and in a different way , but it is not appropriate to put the question directly to him at this time .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am addressing you on behalf of our fellow MEP , Mr Eurig Wyn , who is currently in Turkey as an observer for the local elections .
<2en> He has asked me to inform you and our fellow MEPs of the fact that he has been denied access to the premises where the elections are taking place in various places in Eastern Turkey .
<2en> I think he will be enlarging on this experience , which should be added to the reports of violence during these recent elections in Turkey , which has even resulted in deaths .
<2en> This underlines once again that Turkey is failing to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( UNESCO ) recently awarded its World Press Freedom Prize to the Cuban journalist and writer Raúl Rivero .
<2en> This incurred the usual wrath of the Cuban dictatorship and led to protests against UNESCO for giving this award to a writer and journalist who was sentenced to 20 years in prison , along with 74 other dissidents .
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after this House awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo Payá , and in so doing encouraged Cuban dissidents and the fight for freedom in Cuba , we cannot remain silent .
<2en> We must make the point time and time again that Cuba must respect human rights and that the tyranny of the Cuban regime is outmoded and out of step .
<2en> Mr President , I should like to ask you to communicate with the Cuban authorities and express our concern for the political prisoners ’ health and at the fact that they are languishing in Cuban jails .
<sp>
<2en> – I can do that .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> It seems to me , Mr Bourlanges , that Mr van Hulten ’ s reply clarifies this point .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , since Amendment No 44 was adopted , I should like , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , to withdraw Amendments Nos 29 and 32 .
<2en> They are no longer relevant .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , that is correct , and I am grateful to him .
<2en> From the interpretation I heard only ‘ and ’ , ‘ 29 and 32 ’ .
<2en> As I understand it , 30 and 31 are redundant too , as they deal with exactly the same subject area .
<2en> Perhaps that was an error in interpretation .
<2en> I think that Mr Blak and I can agree that his group ’ s actions have now in fact lapsed .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if my eyes do not deceive me , Mr Hans-Peter Martin did not participate in this vote , something I would very much regret in view of the extensive reform we have just carried out , and I hope that he will duly give us his backing where these matters are concerned .
<2en> After all , it is only right and proper that one should participate in votes of this kind , and I would also have been glad if he had tabled a few amendments in order to put his reforming agenda to the vote .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , I just want to respond to the remarks that have just been made .
<2en> I am here ; I just needed to go out briefly , as a statement was being published on behalf of the President in which allegations were being made about me that simply bore no relation to the facts .
<2en> I have often seen Mr Ferber leave the Chamber under similar circumstances .
<2en> I have always played my part in this reform process , and the present lamentable reaction shows how much you are isolating yourselves , and to what an extent criticisms made from within this House – including my amendments in the committees – are simply ignored .
<2en> I feel sorry for Europe ’ s voters and taxpayers .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I entirely agree with Parliament .
<2en> The only way to combat doping is through zero tolerance .
<2en> In order to save sport , to save sportspeople , to save the values of our European society , we must join forces .
<2en> Combating doping , Mr President , is a question of will , a will which is enshrined in action agreed between the Member States , Sport Federations and the European Union .
<2en> Together , with Parliament , we have already come a long way in terms of effectiveness and I believe that the Athens games were a fine example of this , since , during those games , more cases of doping were detected than during all the previous games put together .
<2en> This is a sign that testing is starting to work .
<2en> It is only the beginning , however , and we must continue this action while we await more powers and more possibilities as a result of the new treaty .
<2en> We have a duty to protect our young people , to protect professional and amateur sportspeople and to protect public health , and in this regard , I would like to emphasise that all the honourable Members who have talked about laboratories , labelling , testing and prevention are absolutely right .
<2en> Now , Mr President , my successor , Mr Figel , will await this initiative from Parliament , this hearing , which will be welcome because , after all , we have a joint responsibility towards sport , towards our citizens , our values , and only by working together can we put that responsibility into practice .
<sp>
<2en> Thank you , Commissioner .
<2en> The debate is closed ( 1 ) .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order in accordance with Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure , with regard to Rule 24 ( 3 ) , which regulates the competences of the Conference of Presidents .
<2en> Yesterday , a Minister from the Italian Government offended this House by saying that it was dominated by gays .
<2en> I am from a country that is currently considering legislation to put an end to discrimination against homosexuals – as in Belgium and the Netherlands .
<2en> This issue is currently subject to subsidiarity , but I would like the Conference of Presidents and the President to ask the Italian Government to apologise , because what is at stake here , ladies and gentlemen , is first and foremost whether the person heading the Commission is Mr Barroso or Mr Berlusconi .
<2en> Secondly , I would like to say to our Italian colleagues that we are prepared to accept an Italian Commissioner with the personal and intellectual rigour of Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to speak on an issue that is no less important , and that affects millions of computer owners throughout the European Union , as well as hundreds of thousands of European small- and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> The issue is that of patents on computer software .
<2en> Thirteen months ago , the European Parliament stood up for European citizens and European companies when it refused to pass legislation that was a copy of the American legislation .
<2en> The Council and the Commission , however , sided with the large companies , and not with the citizens of European countries .
<2en> This issue will soon appear on the agenda for a sitting of Parliament .
<2en> What joint action do we intend to take , Mr President , in order to prove that this House will not be held hostage to the large computer companies , but will act as the voice of a Europe of small- and medium sized enterprises and of a Europe of citizens ?
<2en> This issue may well be no less important for our voters than the major political debates .
<2en> The credibility of the European Parliament ’ s authority is also at stake here .
<sp>
<2en> We will now proceed to the vote . ( 1 )
<chp>

<en> Mr President , my assistant , Vikki Phillips , has just handed me a note which says that Denmark spends 15 times more than Greece in carrying out environmental inspections and making appropriate assessments .
<en> Well , if that is the case , then something is clearly very wrong , and I suspect it is not wrong with Denmark .
<en> I am very pleased to support most of what the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment has said , although I have some trepidation in doing so being conscious that the next ECJ fine may well be against the UK for its failure to comply with the bathing water directive , despite the fact that a great deal of money has been spent and effort made in recent years to reach such compliance .
<en> I want to make it clear , though , that I do not believe that we should be using the failure of some Member States to achieve compliance with environmental legislation to justify weakening our ambitions or claiming that too much legislation is impractical .
<en> I am all for being realistic and for making sure that new legislation makes sense but the problems we face both throughout the European Union and across the world are too great for us to lower our sights .
<en> And I think some of the progress made by the United Kingdom in implementing the habitats directive over the past year demonstrates very clearly that it is very often not the fault of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to blame for the failure to deliver the goods we all wish to see .
<en> I want strongly to support the idea of a scoreboard which the Commissioner mentioned and of gestures to name and shame those Member States which are failing to meet the expectations of MEPs , of the Commission and of the public .
<en> As a politician , the Commissioner knows very well the importance of making sure that that information is presented in a way which is easily digestible and understood by every journalist across the European Union and perhaps a few politicians as well .
<en> So , let us call it the Commission 's little red book , no , let us call it the Commission 's big green book , albeit one with a few black spots on its pages .
<en> Let us name and shame at every opportunity and bring the public alongside us in ensuring that this environmental legislation is enforced and that Member States recognise their responsibilities .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mrs Jackson well expressed the concern of the members of the Committee on the Environment , which in my case is heightened since I belong to the European Parliament ' s Committee on Petitions .
<2en> Forty per cent of the petitions submitted to this committee come from citizens concerned for the preservation of the environment .
<2en> And they usually refer to the habitats directive , the environmental impact directive , the wild birds directive and the right to information directive , which together with those discussed here today on nitrates and PCBs are probably the ones most often infringed .
<2en> Mr Goodwill 's report shows that there are some Member States before the courts , others with proceedings against them , and only two Member States that are above suspicion .
<2en> Mr Sjöstedt too , in his report , mentions those Member States that have repeatedly infringed the habitats directive .
<2en> The Committee on Petitions and I , myself , know that what often happens is that Member States either do not respond in time or , as we say in Spain , and I do not know if there is a good translation , they " make the partridge dizzy " [ try to deceive one ] .
<2en> In addition , with the scant human resources of the Committee members , who are always having to answer the demands not only of the petitioners but also of the governments , it is very difficult to work , Commissioner .
<2en> It is essential that we respect the legislation that we ourselves draw up , and the proof that there is a lack of political will is that some Member States obey it and others break it .
<2en> This can give companies a competitive edge .
<2en> In my opinion , there are three fundamental questions .
<2en> First , something that has already been mentioned here : the deterrent use of European Funds ; European Funds must not be given to projects that break Community law .
<2en> Secondly , suitable penalties must be found ; it is very hard ( I am from a region that badly needs European subsidies ) , but even if it is very hard to freeze certain subsidies , if it is not done the Member States will not understand .
<2en> Lastly , Mr President , the process must be speeded up .
<2en> But I know that this lies in the hands of the courts , this lies in the hands of the governments , this lies in the hands of us all .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the aim of these directives is to protect the environment .
<2en> This means that not only do the Member States transpose the directives into national legislation , they are also the ones who actually implement this national legislation .
<2en> This also means that when monitoring implementation , it should not be the means to an end , but the end itself , which should be looked at .
<2en> Unfortunately , experience has shown that Member States often fail to implement European directives correctly .
<2en> Consequently , campaigns , such as those designed to monitor compliance involving independent inspectorates , are essential .
<2en> As far as the environmental inspections are concerned , the European Parliament has gone to great lengths to ensure that this is regulated effectively .
<2en> However , negotiations have not led to the enactment of a binding directive , because the Council and Commission do not want that at this stage .
<2en> Given this attitude of the Member States , I fear that in future , problems will arise at the implementation stage of other directives too .
<2en> We need only call to mind the many warnings issued by the Commission to the Member States , which in some cases have led to infringement procedures .
<2en> This can only get worse after enlargement , because the current Member States are setting the wrong example .
<2en> Where there are differences in interpretation , the Commission should put forward amendment proposals for workable rules .
<2en> These amendments are not intended for additional or more far-reaching measures , but should help improve the workability of the current rules .
<2en> As far as the PCB [ polychlorinated biphenol ] directive is concerned , we should also turn our attention to the supplies .
<2en> If these are to be maintained for much longer , it will be a rather long time before this directive makes itself felt .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , allow me to start by agreeing with everything Mrs Jackson and many of my fellow Members have said and to focus on a number of points .
<2en> As everyone has pointed out , we have the legislation .
<2en> The problem lies in incorporating and applying this legislation .
<2en> Of course , the political will must be there but it depends mainly on the monitoring carried out by your office , Commissioner .
<2en> If , for example , you receive repeated complaints , instead of dealing with them through time-consuming correspondence , you should take a persistent and decisive stand and make sure the legislation really is implemented .
<2en> And if we have cause to go to the European Court , then let us do so and , if sanctions need to be imposed , then we shall do that too .
<2en> As Mrs Jackson has said , Greece is already paying EUR 20 000 a day and I trust that Greece will come to its senses and fall into line .
<2en> I should particularly like to draw your attention to Directive 92 / 43 on Natura 2000 areas .
<2en> We should not allow projects to go ahead in these areas with a light heart , because Article 6 of the directive says that only in the absence of alternative solutions should a project be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest in Natura 2000 areas .
<2en> And here again I would remind you that in an area of Greece , in the area of Fthiotida , where everyone is against bridging the Maliako Gulf which , it should be noted the Ministry of the Environment and Public Works itself included in the Natura 2000 areas , your office has received complaints about the Greek Government 's intention to build this bridge , which will have a huge environmental impact , even though alternative solutions exist .
<2en> I shall be monitoring - and I welcome the undertaking which you took in your intervention and I hope that it is a real undertaking - what happens in all the areas in Europe which are Natura 2000 areas including , of course , the Maliako Gulf , where there are plans to build a bridge which will wipe out an important habitat .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , first of all I must thank the Commissioner and the Chairman and other colleagues for their words of wisdom .
<en> They are very positive and clear commitments to do something about this very serious problem .
<en> But it is not just words we need , it is actions , it is deeds , and we cannot rely on Member States to do this alone .
<en> Even if representatives of the Council were here , which they do not appear to be , even if they were prepared to make statements , which they do not appear to be , we would not be able to leave them to do it on their own .
<en> We need some kind of watchdog to monitor and ensure the implementation of legislation .
<en> Sadly our own Environment Agency does not appear to be up to the job yet .
<en> We can but hope .
<en> So what solutions do we have ?
<en> What can Parliamentarians do ?
<en> Well , these three reports before Parliament today are a start .
<en> They name and shame .
<en> They call for fines .
<en> They make proposals for further improvement .
<en> But , they also make a point which we must take on board here in Parliament .
<en> They say essentially that bad legislation should never have been put on the statute book .
<en> And that is a lesson that we have to take to heart .
<en> Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better .
<en> We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet .
<en> When we put better legislation on the agenda in future , it has to be respected .
<en> Because of the failure of Member States to put into place legislation , typically the PCBs and PCTs legislation , we now have the extremely serious problem of a long-term contamination of our food chain by a persistent toxic chemical .
<en> That toxic chemical is slowly but surely accumulating in the human food chain , reaching levels which are already beyond World Health Organisation levels in certain fatty substances , typically butter , and in some cases fatty fish , such as salmon .
<en> They are now creeping up the food chain to the point where our children are now starting to ingest amounts of these toxins that are beyond those that are recommended by the World Health Organisation .
<en> If we are not prepared to take serious action promptly in future we will see further problems of this kind affecting future generations .
<en> We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I agree with what has been said and I would like to thank the President of this Parliament for what he has said about the referendum held in my country yesterday .
<2en> It was a lesson in democracy .
<2en> The day passed without incident .
<2en> Everybody in favour of a ‘ yes ’ vote , everybody in favour of a ‘ no ’ vote and also everybody in favour of abstaining participated fully .
<2en> Nobody can therefore give our country lessons in democracy , since everybody was free to act with total freedom .
<2en> Furthermore , an important radio station owned by the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Catholic Church campaigned constantly for the ‘ no ’ camp and the results are there to see , but nobody stopped it from defending that position , which was as legitimate as any other .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , a few days ago , the President of the Greek Parliament , addressing the new President of the Hellenic Republic , told him that , in the light of the referendum – in the light of the endorsement of the Constitution – Greece needed to restrict its national borders and its national sovereignty .
<2en> This is dramatic .
<2en> The Greek people need to be told why , for the prosperity of Europe , they need to be deprived of land and sovereignty .
<2en> That is what was heard .
<2en> A way has to be found of at least allaying the concerns of the Greek people .
<2en> We want Europe to prosper , but not of course at the expense of the national borders of our country , at the expense of national sovereignty .
<2en> We need to ensure that , if the Constitution is passed , Greece will not lose land , as – I repeat – the President of the Greek Parliament said .
<2en> As far as Spain 's referendum is concerned , 33 % of the Spanish people voted in favour .
<2en> There was a very poor turnout ...
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , every professional criminal organisation in Europe must have jumped for joy at the European Central Bank 's recent decision to double its printing of 500-euro banknotes .
<2en> This year alone , 190 million more of the highest-value banknotes in the world will hit our streets , and a suitcase full of these is worth seven times as much as a suitcase filled with 100-dollar bills .
<2en> In today 's electronic world , banks do not need large denomination notes : they are of value only to criminals .
<2en> Why else did 10 % of all the euros issued at its launch suddenly disappear into Russia ?
<2en> Why is it still the currency of choice for the Russian mafia ?
<2en> Why did Hussein invoice Iraq 's secret oil sales in euros when he was trying to avoid sanctions ?
<2en> Last year , the number of counterfeit 500-euro notes rose by ...
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , we hope that the unification of Europe , at least as far as its economic and monetary union is concerned , means the lifting of barriers , means the lifting of borders in the economic sector .
<2en> This is the quintessence of the common market and of the single European market .
<2en> Greek euro-scepticism is directed at exactly what the European Union is ; a European Union which has not progressed with the same speed as far as its political union is concerned , as far as acquiring a genuine , authentic European defence identity is concerned .
<2en> That is what the President of the Greek Parliament said .
<2en> She stated the obvious ; that the economic borders have been lifted and that there is a single , homogenous economic area .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ever since this Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to endorse the European Constitution a month ago , some of those who were in the minority have sought to disrupt and discredit the position taken by the European Parliament .
<2en> They waved banners in this hall when we took our vote ; they tried to disrupt the official launch of the European Parliament 's information campaign ; they have made the claim that it is somehow illegitimate for this Parliament to present its view and its conclusion to the outside world .
<2en> Even when we have been invited by national parliaments to present our assessment of the Constitution , they have written to them and complained that we have accepted such invitations .
<2en> Today , we hear them claiming that the result of the referendum in Spain was somehow illegitimate .
<2en> Of course it had a low turnout it was not controversial and it had overwhelming and broad support .
<2en> But the bottom line is endorsement by a huge majority , which I am sure will be repeated in other countries .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> . – I am voting against this resolution , as I consider it to be contrary to the principles of the market economy .
<2en> Experience in Sweden shows that the solutions proposed in the resolution will make no impact on the problems there is a desire to solve .
<sp>
<2en> . – The June List does not believe that the European Parliament should become involved in deciding where enterprises should locate their production .
<2en> Each Member State should be free to conduct its own industrial policy within the framework of competition law .
<2en> The survival of the European steel industry depends on its competitiveness on the international market , not on protection and subsidies .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the resolution on future prospects for the steel industry .
<2en> The steel industry is one of the areas in which technological development is crucial and in which we have come across a number of examples of areas of production viewed as models in terms of their technological know-how .
<2en> These industrial activities account for a large proportion of the population of the enlarged Europe and , in recent years , there has been substantial public investment in innovation and development in European industrial interests .
<2en> I should like to point out that much of that investment has come from Community funds and that clear and practical rules are required as to how those funds are used .
<2en> We must not allow the businesses concerned to sidestep the agreed conditions on the basis of which they enjoy those subsidies , obligations such as long-term production in the territory and maintaining jobs .
<2en> The situation is all the more serious when , as mentioned in the resolution , the business concerned registers positive net results and economic growth , and yet takes the inexplicable decision to relocate or to close the plant in question .
<sp>
<2en> . – We express our undivided solidarity and support for the workers at the Thyssen Krupp steelworks in Terni in Italy , who are fighting for the right to work and for industrial steel production to be protected and against the anti-labour policy of the EU and of the company , which is expressed in terms of coercion and threats of further redundancies .
<2en> Nonetheless , we abstained from the vote on the joint motion for a resolution by the European Parliament because :
<2en> - it places the workers ' interest within the Lisbon strategy , which is an assault on employment rights and which promotes mass redundancies and unemployment ;
<2en> - it equates the interests of workers being made redundant with the competitiveness of the European monopolies and of this specific industrial group and pleads for social cohesion , meaning the abolition of the class struggle to reverse mass redundancies ;
<2en> - it calls for more ' corporate social responsibility ' , thereby cultivating the dangerous delusion that monopolies can be pro-worker and pro-grass roots .
<2en> The state of the steel industry is the result of capitalist restructurings , market liberalisation and the concentration of capital .
<2en> The European Union itself and the governments of the Member States have strengthened big business in the practices of restructuring , relocating and shutting down units and activities , indifferent to the social consequences .
<2en> The right to work and satisfaction of contemporary grass-roots needs will be achieved through the working-class and grass-roots fight against the ΕU and its anti-labour policy .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I should like to give the following explanation of vote with regard to the vote on the human rights report .
<2en> We have voted in favour of the report as a whole , although there are a number of key paragraphs in it that we have been unable to endorse , above all the one relating to reproductive health and the Brazilian initiative .
<2en> I should like to stress that our Group voted against these points because we do not wish the human rights report to be used as a pretext for the liberalisation of abortion through the back door .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Hiroshima was devastated by an atomic bomb sixty years ago this summer .
<2en> Including the effects of radiation poisoning , the five-year death total was over two hundred thousand , almost two thirds of the city 's population .
<2en> In May the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) comes up for another five-year review by those countries that are party to it .
<2en> The treaty regime is weaker than it has been since its entry into force in 1970 .
<2en> If this vital security instrument is to continue to be effective , it is highly important that the central bargain be revived by the NPT nuclear weapon states , led by Washington , at the review conference .
<2en> 1962 saw predictions of as many as 25 to 30 nuclear weapons states with such weapons integrated into their arsenals by the end of the 1970s .
<2en> This could have resulted in over forty such nations today , leaving nuclear weapons vulnerable to the hands of terrorists .
<2en> But it did not happen .
<2en> Today there are only two more states with nuclear weapon programmes than there were in 1970 ...
<sp>
<2en> . – The motion for a resolution on nuclear weapons may well describe the situation , but it focuses solely on the problem of non-proliferation , rather than on the problem of the existence and use of nuclear weapons .
<2en> Only the United States have used nuclear weapons , committing a huge crime against humanity in Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
<2en> Depleted uranium was also used by NATO forces in the wars against Iraq , Yugoslavia and Afghanistan , with devastating consequences .
<2en> No mention is made of these issues .
<2en> Interest in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is hypocritical , unless it is linked to a demand for immediate specific action to destroy them , starting with the European nuclear powers ( France , Britain ) , and unless a clear request is made for US nuclear weapons to be removed from Europe .
<2en> From this point of view , with the situation as it stands and taking account of the fact that the United States have reversed their commitment not to use nuclear weapons and strike first , the reference to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons directs people 's attention away from the real dangers arising from the imperialist nuclear powers .
<2en> We support general nuclear disarmament and that is why we shall abstain from the vote .
<sp>
<2en> In the context of the long-standing and more far-reaching objective of securing total compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty , if we are to be realistic , some concerns are more urgent and serious than others .
<2en> The danger represented by nuclear arms being acquired by pariah states not committed to international law and by terrorist groups cannot be compared with the acquisition of such arms by states which form part of the fabric of modern international relations , and it would not be reasonable to act as if the two were comparable .
<2en> Against that background , the situation both in North Korea and Iran gives us cause for concern .
<2en> In the case of Iran , the hopes we are pinning on the work done as part of the negotiations conducted by the EU should not blind us to the fact that the indications of any real commitment by Iran to the proposals are very slight .
<2en> In the case of North Korea , however , there are more than indications , there are clear statements and instances of behaviour on the part of the leaders of that country that should give the international community pause for thought about what actions it may have to take in due course .
<2en> World security calls for careful reflection , respect for the law and courage when the time comes for a decision .
<sp>
<2en> In developing their nuclear arms programmes , North Korea and Iran have adopted an approach that obviously indicates contempt for international law and for the agreements they have signed , the consequences of which are clearly damaging for world peace and political stability .
<2en> Such behaviour , which borders on belligerence in some cases , calls for a firm and united response on the part of the European Union .
<2en> This does not just involve condemning the attitude displayed by those who breach agreements , but also making every effort , as a matter of urgency , to get the North Korean and Iranian Governments to return to the negotiating table , failing which they will be subject to economic and political sanctions .
<2en> The EU should also carry out a prior analysis of the consequences for Europe – particularly in political and economic terms – of the possibility of Iran and North Korea possessing nuclear arms .
<2en> Lastly , I believe that the EU and its Member States should put up a common front at the 2005 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference , and exhort the international community to strengthen programmes designed to prevent the spread of nuclear materials , technology and know-how , and to adopt additional measures to avoid terrorists or those that harbour them having access to weapons of mass destruction and their components .
<2en> I voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> While we support a robust NPT and steps to curtail the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran , we have abstained on this resolution because we are not in agreement with the following paragraphs in particular :
<2en> paragraphs 10 and 19 - we believe that conventional forces alone cannot ensure credible deterrence , that nuclear weapons make a unique contribution in rendering the risks of aggression against the UK and its allies incalculable and unacceptable and consequently that they remain essential to preserving peace ;
<2en> paragraph 15 - we do not agree that the EU has a role in coordinating intelligence ;
<2en> paragraph 17 - we believe that the presence of United States conventional and nuclear forces in Europe remain vital to the security of the continent and consequently it would be wrong to call on " the USA to clarify the situation of the quantity and strategic objectives of its tactical nuclear arsenals stationed on European bases " ;
<2en> paragraph 18 - Israel has not declared that it possesses nuclear weapons and therefore it is in appropriate to include Israel in this context ;
<2en> paragraph 31 - the United States has not declared that it would " not engage in preventive military action against Iran " , and it would be wrong to rule out any option at this stage .

<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I still have vivid memories of the visit I made to Kyrgyzstan a few years ago .
<2en> It is a country of great natural beauty and boasts an abundance of water , which is a great natural resource in that part of the world .
<2en> The eyes of the world were recently drawn again to Kyrgyzstan when its long-time leader , President Akayev , was overthrown .
<2en> Some people , including some of those present in this Chamber , have rather naively interpreted this as an event similar to those that had previously taken place in Georgia and Ukraine .
<2en> The truth is rather different , however .
<2en> The new Georgian and Ukrainian governments are going to great lengths to ensure that their countries pursue policies of independence from Moscow .
<2en> In Kyrgyzstan , however , the new political set-up is just as pro-Russian as its predecessor , if not more so .
<2en> The situation in the country remains far from stable , as evidenced by the recent assassination attempt on Mr Erkinbayev , who is running for president .
<2en> Current events in Kyrgyzstan cannot be viewed in black and white terms , even though some Western observers appear to wish that this were the case .
<2en> It is essential for the EU to play a more active role in this part of the world , and it must not leave the peoples involved to the mercy of the Russians and the Americans .
<2en> That said , we should of course cooperate with both of the latter on this issue .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am pleased that the Commission has cleared up the misunderstanding about the Council ’ s communication with regard to the election date : it is 10 July .
<2en> All credit to the Commission , therefore , which was better informed .
<2en> I should like to echo the words by the chairman of the Delegation for Central Asia who has already indicated that we should be careful not to compare the situation in Kyrgyzstan with that in Ukraine .
<2en> Time will tell whether the revolution is the same , or whether a number of leaders have brought another process in motion .
<2en> The situation in Kyrgyzstan is significantly different : its democracy is divided along ethnic and regional lines , which does not , in itself , make matters worse , nor does it alter the fact that the European Union would do well to invest in Central Asia .
<2en> At the moment , too little is being invested and the striking thing is that until recently , the two poorest countries , Mongolia – a country deserving credit for the absence of any problems in the areas of democracy and human rights – and Kyrgyzstan , were doing best of all .
<2en> Now that a revolution in Kyrgyzstan is underway , we should capitalise on it .
<2en> I am pleased with the 25 million from the Commission , but it does seem to be a pittance .
<2en> In the short term , the European Union should do as follows .
<2en> I call upon the Council and the Commission , together with Parliament , to invest in the elections by sending a solid observation delegation on 10 July and by supporting the OSCE , to ensure that the elections go well .
<2en> Indeed , elections that go well will instil trust in the people , also for subsequent parliamentary elections .
<2en> In addition , it is important for the European Union to invest more in education and economic cooperation , because it is too crazy for words that the lion ’ s share of foreign investments in education are currently being made by fundamentalist Islamic groupings .
<2en> That situation must end .
<2en> It is a challenge for Europe to invest more in Kyrgyzstan , particularly in the areas of education and economic cooperation .
<2en> The country also requires sound free trade agreements to this end .
<2en> I would like to add another critical note about that region .
<2en> I should like to find out from the Commission what it intends to do about increasing repression in Kazakhstan , including the recent closure of the biggest opposition newspaper and the imprisonment of its journalist Irina Petrusheva in Russia at the request of the authorities in Kazakhstan .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many things have been said in the previous speeches to which I will not return .
<2en> Overall , I agree with the content of the draft common resolution that has been proposed .
<2en> Nevertheless , I would like to stress the importance of three points .
<2en> First , economic and social difficulties were a major trigger for the events in Kyrgyzstan .
<2en> This is because the situation of considerable uncertainty and poverty formed fertile ground , favourable to the spread of demonstrations and to the overthrow of the government of Mr Akaev , who had been making himself rich off the Kyrgyz economy since 1991 .
<2en> Unacceptable practices , including corruption and nepotism , increased the silent but legitimate discontent of the people , who aspire to an improvement in their situation , and we must pay attention to these aspirations .
<2en> Thus , if we are going to support the ongoing process of transition to democracy , we must pay particular attention to the honesty and transparency of the elections , and to the implementation of a policy of dialogue and national reconciliation .
<2en> Only a stable , legitimate government will be able to successfully complete the reforms that are necessary to improve the situation of Kyrgyz citizens .
<2en> Next , the stakes in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute another crucial aspect of the current situation .
<2en> The European Union must satisfy itself that the democratisation process is based on true political pluralism and also allows the media and NGOs to operate freely and independently .
<2en> The cooperation projects launched by the OSCE and as part of the TACIS programme must be supported and encouraged .
<2en> Finally , I think we need to broaden our thinking in relation to the events in Kyrgyzstan to a regional perspective encompassing the whole of Central Asia .
<2en> The democratisation of Kyrgyzstan could thus be seen as a hope , an example that the other countries of Central Asia , suffering from violations of human rights , can follow .
<2en> The recent toughening of legislation aimed at NGOs and opposition groups calls for an attitude of attentiveness and of particular vigilance by the European Union faced with the changing political situation in the region .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Kyrgyzstan is a small , central Asian Muslim republic of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions .
<2en> Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864 , but it achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
<2en> It has recently been in the news , following the 27 February parliamentary elections , when election irregularities caused widespread protest , starting in the south of the country .
<2en> The president was forced to flee , accused of corruption and stealing the election .
<2en> Yesterday , on a state visit to Georgia , President Bush called for freedom and democracy everywhere in the Communist world .
<2en> Kyrgyzstan is a poor , mountainous country with a predominantly agricultural economy , but it has carried out significant market reforms under ex-President Akaev .
<2en> He has distinguished himself by adopting relatively liberal economic policies , and has introduced an improved regulatory system and land reform .
<2en> Kyrgyzstan was the first CIS country to be accepted into the WTO , and most state companies have been sold off , although , regrettably , cronyism and corruption have been rife .
<2en> It is hoped that its revolution – if it is a revolution – will place it on a firm path to democracy , respect for human rights and good governance .
<2en> It could be a model for surrounding states like Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Tajikistan which maintain authoritarian systems that are only in partial transition .
<2en> But border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and its neighbours are delaying the process of frontier delimitation with Tajikistan in particular , but also with Uzbekistan .
<2en> There is also the problem of the illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppies for the CIS markets and limited government eradication of illicit narcotic crops .
<2en> Kyrgyzstan also serves as a transit point to south-west Asian narcotic markets and narcotics bound for Russia and the rest of Europe .
<2en> Presidential elections are scheduled for July : I have confirmed this from the Internet .
<2en> The European Parliament should definitely send observers to watch Kyrgyzstan ’ s transition to democracy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is plain to see that the European Parliament is very keen to cooperate with Kyrgyzstan , as well as with the other Central Asian countries .
<2en> Evidence of this can be found in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement concluded in 1995 .
<2en> Issues of interest to Parliament include human rights , the democratisation of everyday life , environmental protection and energy , and these should be the focus of particular attention .
<2en> A great many hopes were pinned upon the Kyrgyz Constitution when it was adopted in 1993 .
<2en> Even though it has since been amended four times , it would still appear to be a potentially good basis for further democratic changes in the country .
<2en> Yet although according to the Constitution the judicial system is officially independent and responsible for ensuring that human rights are observed in the country , observers have made it clear that not enough reforms have taken place within it , that corruption is still endemic and that judges are not paid enough .
<2en> According to these observers , the appointment by the president of the members of the Constitutional Court , the judges of the Supreme Court and the arbitrators of the Arbitration Court violates democratic principles .
<2en> They have warned that human rights must not be curtailed on the pretext of combating terrorism .
<2en> The European Union can and should provide the financial support it always does in order to reverse these negative trends .
<2en> Furthermore , it can and should provide its customary moral support by being present wherever it is needed and wherever democracy must be supported and the rule of law reestablished .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> . – Mr President , I , too , should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Turmes , most sincerely for his outstanding report and for his excellent cooperation .
<2en> In spite of the few words of criticism from Mr Liese , I am very confident that this report will be adopted tomorrow with a large majority .
<2en> The current oil crisis , in particular , has made it increasingly clear that finite sources of energy must be replaced with constantly self-renewing sources .
<2en> The EU has recently launched a successful strategy for the expansion of renewable energies , which includes legal requirements for targets , for example for electricity from biofuels .
<2en> We have achieved market penetration and thus made an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
<2en> Creating 300 000 jobs and producing an annual turnover of approximately EUR 15 billion , this expansion has also made an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy .
<2en> The efforts being made are insufficient , however .
<2en> As has also been noted already , the level of compliance with the biofuel targets is far from satisfactory , and the Commission has had to give a number of Member States strong reminders about meeting the electricity targets .
<2en> Obstacles to be removed include bureaucratic barriers , problems of grid capacity and inadequate support systems .
<2en> For I have not yet given up on one thing : the idea that we can meet the target of doubling the renewable-energy share of overall energy consumption to 12 % by 2010 .
<2en> There is one thing that remains very important to this end , however : closing the legislative gap in the field of heating and cooling .
<2en> This means that we need clear legal requirements with clear targets , in order to create incentives for the Member States to take appropriate action , and in order to exploit the considerable potential of biomass , solar thermal energy and geothermal energy in this field .
<2en> This is a very important message to the Commission , therefore : I urge you to take action in this field and table the appropriate legislation .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to thank Mr Turmes for his work , for the work that we have done together .
<2en> The document is very important because it restores the balance in a situation that seems to favour centralised , concentrated energy production .
<2en> Renewable energies have been remarkably neglected .
<2en> Now , at last , we can consider redressing the balance and therefore devote to renewables the research effort that they have not enjoyed until now , but which they deserve because of the essential contribution that they can make to our energy requirements .
<2en> They contribute to a guarantee of sustainability , in that they are non-CO2 emitting and CO2 neutral , and to our energy independence , as well as to job creation in the European Union precisely at such a difficult time , as we have already seen today in the debate on the oil document , thanks to technology in which we are world leaders .
<2en> It will be an effort that should first of all give us precise information on the contribution that each source can make .
<2en> I am sure that their contributions will be extremely important in an absolute sense – beyond our wildest dreams – not least because production will be spread out .
<2en> That will lead to a greater sense of responsibility and a leap forwards in energy efficiency , through the widespread adoption of electricity generation coupled with heating and cooling at the same time .
<2en> That approach should be a priority , because it embodies our commitment .
<2en> In particular , I should like to highlight the contribution of biomass ; in gas conversion processes it can produce hydrogen directly , and we all know how important that is .
<2en> Other renewables like wind power have already made a considerable contribution , and others are extremely promising .
<2en> That must be our commitment , and I believe that with Mr Turmes and his group we shall succeed in doing a lot more work yet .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I join in thanking Mr Turmes for the excellent work we have done together .
<2en> Let there be no doubt : the great majority of the scientific community is now convinced that greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of the rise in global temperature , and there remains a reasonable doubt that the increasing frequency and violence of recent natural disasters are correlated with this warming .
<2en> To reduce greenhouse gases we have to aim at bringing the oil age to an end and turning to alternative energy sources , starting with the first alternative source which is energy efficiency .
<2en> A policy to increase efficiency and reduce waste can , within a few years , achieve a saving of over 20 % in oil consumption ; a similar amount could result from a massive switch to renewables such as wind , solar and biomass .
<2en> The European Commission ’ s Green Paper on energy is a good starting point but , for it to be effective , research programmes need to be prepared that can simulate the development of sustainable and competitive energy systems , including by means of multi-annual demonstration projects – here in the European Parliament , for instance – and policies supporting small and medium-sized enterprises that invest in the sector .
<2en> Mass investment needs to be accompanied by financial and fiscal incentives for alternative energies , aiming at the development of the necessary infrastructure – for hydrogen for instance – and at sustainable transport .
<2en> The role of the European Union is decisive , not least to spur on national policies and to put Community directives into practice : only by making a coordinated effort across the continent can Europe become a credible player in global energy policies .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent work .
<2en> The various energy crises coupled with the prospect of the exhaustion of non-renewable organic fuels in view of increased demand and the need to protect the environment have led to increased interest in sources of renewable energy .
<2en> I therefore welcome the decision to debate this issue in the House .
<2en> Mr Turmes referred to the sun .
<2en> Even if all the supplies of fuels such as oil , gas , coal and wood could be burnt as efficiently as possible , the amount of energy obtained would only be equal to the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth in barely four days .
<2en> That is something worth noting .
<2en> The issue we are debating is of fundamental importance , and it is unfortunate that we are debating it late at night with so few Members present .
<2en> There are many aspects to the challenge before us , for instance the technical , research , environmental , climatic , economic , social and defence aspects to name but a few .
<2en> Specific action in this regard must be taken across the whole Union , with due consideration for international cooperation .
<2en> This should be undertaken in individual countries ...
<sp>
<2en> Regrettably , the countries of the European Union do not possess significant natural sources of energy .
<2en> A few months ago , the institutions of the European Union addressed the issue of energy security in Europe .
<2en> According to one admittedly platonic statement , the dependency of European countries on external energy sources will increase from 50 to 70 % in the next twenty years .
<2en> If we consider the implications of these facts , then the energy policy of the European Union appears markedly naïve , especially from the standpoint of securing an adequate level of energy self-sufficiency .
<2en> I certainly support measures in favour of increased energy efficiency , establishing the preconditions for an increase in the share of alternative and renewable energy sources , and energy conservation .
<2en> On the other hand , to have a realistic chance of meeting energy requirements , Europeans must overcome their phobia of nuclear energy and of established forms of energy production , operated , of course , in strict compliance with environmental and operational norms .
<2en> European institutions should also adopt a more far-sighted approach to the closure of existing energy installations .
<2en> In this context , I must criticise the decision , motivated largely by political considerations , to decommission prematurely the nuclear power plant at Jaslovské Bohunice , in spite of the fact that the plant meets operational safety requirements .
<2en> This will weaken the energy potential not of only Slovakia , but of the entire European Union , and will draw away resources that might have served , among other things , to finance programmes aimed at supporting alternative forms of energy .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mr Beaupuy is drawing our attention to the urban areas as driving forces in the development of countries and regions .
<2en> Given the role of cities as development areas for knowledge and economic activity , it strikes me as useful to contemplate the specific impact cities have on attaining the Lisbon objectives .
<2en> I am pleased that the rapporteur has devoted his attention to this issue .
<2en> In addition , the rapporteur is right in pointing out that both the Commission and the Member States can each in their own way contribute to the development of cities : the Commission by monitoring the side effects general economic and regional policy have on cities , and Member States by drawing up development plans for their cities and urban areas .
<2en> Although cross-fertilisation is necessary and possible in certain areas , this evaluation appears to be doing justice only to the fundamental powers of both Member States and the Commission .
<2en> I can therefore warmly support his calls to the Member States for added consideration to urban policy , and warmly congratulate him on this fine report .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , it is abundantly obvious that our old town centres are dying .
<2en> As one of the previous speakers rightly said , town centres are becoming places where drug addicts , criminals and migrants congregate .
<2en> The Council of Europe turned its attention to this problem some time ago , but with little success .
<2en> There certainly are economic reasons for the death of these old town centres , but the so-called European social model has aggravated the situation further .
<2en> Rents in town centres are cheap and controlled , and rents for subsidised premises on the outskirts are also low .
<2en> Consequently , people prefer not to live in the centres , because it simply does not pay them to do so .
<2en> If this policy remains unchanged so will the state of affairs , and the situation in town centres will steadily worsen .
<2en> Even now , one only has to look upwards of an evening in cities such as Brussels , Strasbourg , Venice , Rome and Florence to see the dark windows of uninhabited buildings that have usually been well maintained .
<2en> People do not wish to live in them because it does not pay them to do so .
<2en> There are also demographic reasons for this state of affairs .
<2en> The population of Europe is decreasing and this means people do not wish to live in the old town centres where criminals and drug addicts are concentrated .
<2en> If things are not put right and the economic and demographic conditions remain unchanged , nothing will be achieved .
<2en> It is worth keeping in mind that all this is the result of the so-called European social model .
<2en> Nonetheless , it suffices for someone to venture to make the least comment on the subject of this notorious social model in the House for all hell to be let loose against them .
<2en> Members will recall the statements made yesterday by Commissioner McCreevy on the matter .
<2en> The Commissioner had Europe ’ s own interests at heart when he indicated that Europe had to become competitive and efficient , and that it cannot allow itself to be as social as it is and would like to be .
<2en> At least , that is what I gleaned from how his statements were reported .
<2en> The outcome was that Commissioner McCreevy was summoned to appear before the House .
<2en> This is not the way to build Europe and it is not the way to save our beautiful old historic town centres either .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the urban dimension represents man ’ s way of life today and in the immediate future .
<2en> Eighty per cent of the world ’ s population will be concentrated in densely urbanised areas of the planet , bringing us close to the posited by the geographer Constantinos Doxiadis in the early 1970s .
<2en> Another geographer of international repute , Jean Gottmann , described the spread of another pattern of settlement and urban development – the megalopolis – as exemplified today by the urban sprawls on the Atlantic coast of the United States , and in Southern China and Japan .
<2en> The phenomenon of massive urban expansion is also underway on the coast of California , in India – between Delhi and Calcutta – as well as in Europe , along the Rhine axis of the Ruhr , which runs from Germany to the Netherlands , and in Italy ’ s industrial triangle of Milan-Genoa-Turin .
<2en> I will stop there or the list of examples will grow too long .
<2en> These are huge demographic melting pots of often very different cultures and social groups .
<2en> These highly artificial constructs suffer from constant energy and environmental imbalances , as well as worsening problems of communication , water supply , social tension and crime .
<2en> Unlike closed natural systems , these artificial ecosystems are configured as open systems .
<2en> They should therefore try to sustain themselves by focusing on certain priorities : reduction of waste production and improved recycling of resources ; and planning of efficient horizontal dimensions , which depend not only on what a city produces and how it produces it , but also on how a city interacts with other urban centres and surrounding suburban or rural areas .
<2en> Mr Beaupuy is surely right to highlight in his report the importance of urban partnership networks , at both interregional and cross-border levels .
<2en> The dimensions of the problems encountered are spread over such a broad spatial area that it is only through an integrated approach to investment and administration – we might define it as the great urban basin – that we can hope effectively to tackle them .
<2en> We need to find a way of making sure we do not move from the reality of a ‘ megalopolis ’ to the reality of a ‘ necropolis ’ .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , 80 % of the population of Europe lives in towns and cities .
<2en> Consequently , it would be absurd for the policy of the Structural Funds to ignore the problems of towns and cities , be they unemployment , crime or quality of life .
<2en> This European Parliament has always shown an interest in the problems of towns and cities , both small and large , and in 1999 , I would remind you , the Community URBAN initiative was maintained at the insistence of the European Parliament .
<2en> The Beaupuy report underlines this interest and sends the message to the European Commission and the Council that we need to show an increased interest from now on in the problems of towns and cities .
<2en> We know that the Structural Fund regulations integrate the Community URBAN initiative into the basic programmes .
<2en> This is something the European Parliament welcomes and is supporting in its negotiations with the Council on the new Structural Fund regulations for the period from 2007 to 2013 .
<2en> At the same time , we shall try in these negotiations to highlight the urban dimension even more , by emphasising the call for it to include a list of towns and cities which will be covered by the Structural Fund programmes for all the Member States for the period from 2007 to 2013 , in order to make action by Member States on towns and cities more specific .
<2en> Similarly , we are waiting for the guidelines from the European Commission in order to ascertain how the interest of the European Union in towns and cities is being specialised , including through the guidelines , and we are here to support specific proposals by the European Commission , while remaining faithful at all times to the line which the European Parliament took a great many years ago .
<sp>
<2en> – Ladies and gentlemen , I had the pleasure and privilege of working with Mr Beaupuy on the report on the urban dimension in the context of enlargement .
<2en> We agreed fairly early on that the problems affecting towns and cities in the new Member States are no different from those that have affected – and to a large extent continue to affect – urban centres in countries that became Member States much earlier .
<2en> I mention this merely to confirm how similar we in fact are .
<2en> I welcome the fact that Parliament is addressing the issue of towns and cities and large agglomerations and I hope that this initiative will meet with a commensurate response from the Commission in the form of practical measures .
<2en> As I discovered in discussions with representatives from Czech towns and cities – and I have no reason to doubt that the situation is similar in the other new Member States – the most pressing problems include sizeable investment deficit inherited from previous years , property inherited from the army , transport and regenerating industrial waste ground and pre-fabricated housing estates ; I could go on in this vein .
<2en> We must not forget that towns and municipalities are important stakeholders in the EU ’ s cohesion policy .
<2en> Between 2000 and 2006 some EUR 30 billion was earmarked for towns and cities , and I firmly believe that that figure will be exceeded in the forthcoming financial perspective 2007 – 2013 .
<2en> Some people complain of the red tape involved in submitting projects and applications for appropriations from the European funds .
<2en> I should like to remind those people that we are talking about the money of European taxpayers , our fellow European citizens , and we must accordingly establish clear rules and exercise a certain degree of caution when dealing with them .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , Commissioner , the Culture 2007 programme is the main means for implementing Community action in the field of culture .
<2en> It sets a series of important objectives , such as the cross-border mobility of cultural agencies in Europe , the transnational movement of artists and cultural works and cultural dialogue , objectives which cannot be implemented satisfactorily by the Member States due to their transnational character .
<2en> However , we must not forget that the programme is also the means for financing these objectives .
<2en> We cannot therefore set objectives for culture without at the same time proposing what the financial resources will be with which we shall achieve them .
<2en> Consequently we , as the European Parliament , must propose a specific amount in the budget .
<2en> However , when we talk about the objectives of the programme , we must emphasise that the maintenance and knowledge of cultural heritage must be expressly included in the objectives of this programme .
<2en> Among these plans , prime position must continue to be given to actions which aim to rescue the architectural heritage of Europe .
<2en> Another point which we must also keep an eye on is facilitating the participation of small agencies in the programme , which is often difficult .
<2en> Our rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , who has done an excellent job , is well versed in this subject and his report takes account of the needs of small cultural agencies and , by extension , of small countries .
<sp>
<2en> – It is symbolic that in the same week when the leaders of Europe 's countries will debate the challenges of globalisation , the Parliament is discussing the EU cultural programme .
<2en> It is symbolic because in the future culture industries will probably become the European Union 's main competitive advantage .
<2en> We will be unable to compete in terms of labour costs or cost effectiveness .
<2en> Therefore , it is very important to promote creativity and more attention must be devoted to this in the cultural programme .
<2en> I disagree with the European Commission 's opinion that the more participants in the cultural programme , the more visible it is .
<2en> This is a grandiose view , whereas we must look towards cultural originality .
<2en> This originality is certainly not achieved through the number of operators , and this should not be increased .
<2en> Another important aspect , which is relevant to the promotion of culture and creativity , is namely the multilateral exchange process .
<2en> Of course , it is very important for us to preserve our cultural heritage , but the cultural programme must put a clear emphasis on the future and the creative generation of new ideas .
<2en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , as we face the financial perspective of Culture 2007 we are very worried about an issue that the European Union has not yet properly addressed : the promotion of marginalised languages and of minority languages within the EU .
<2en> I would like to refer specifically to the budget problems for the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages , whose main goal is to maintain real language diversity in the European Union .
<2en> According to the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages , each linguistic community has the right to maintain and develop its own language and pass it on to future generations .
<2en> In the European Union we have official languages , minority languages and languages like Catalan that , being majority languages in their own country , are not in the first or second groups .
<2en> The EU has to provide support for all these languages and for linguistic diversity in Europe .
<2en> That means a budget is needed for minority languages and for the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages .
<2en> I know that is against the Jacobinist language policy that is practised in some European states , but the EU will work to promote diversity , democracy and freedom and to maintain real equality between languages in the European Union .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , Commissioner , esteemed rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen .
<2en> The ‘ Culture 2007 ’ report that is presently before Parliament , after being accepted at the cultural commission , has lost all the amendments referring to the preservation of the memory of the crimes of Stalinism .
<2en> In terms of total number of deaths , Stalinism was no less tragic than Nazism .
<2en> Mass deportation and concentration camps were part of the arsenal of both regimes .
<2en> In my homeland , Estonia , nearly 10 % of the population was deported and killed under the leadership of Stalin .
<2en> Elderly people and children represented more than half of the number of those deported .
<2en> Even pregnant women were shown no mercy .
<2en> Stalinism and Nazism are two sides of the same ideology .
<2en> They were conceived together .
<2en> They divided Europe through the Hitler-Stalin pact .
<2en> After the expansion of the European Union , we cannot avoid passing judgment on the crimes of Stalinism , which were mainly committed in Eastern Europe .
<2en> That judgment alone symbolises that we are members of one European family .
<2en> The bearers of a misanthropic ideology remain a threat to us .
<2en> Their face changes as necessary , but inside , Neo-Nazis , national Bolsheviks , neo-Stalinists and so on are nevertheless brothers in arms .
<2en> In the name of Europe , we must not let the crimes of Nazism or Stalinism be forgotten .
<2en> The Cultural Commission agreed to transfer the preservation of the memory of Nazism and Stalinism to the ‘ Citizens for Europe ’ programme .
<2en> It is no secret that the ‘ Citizens for Europe ’ programme received even less funding than ‘ Culture 2007 ’ .
<2en> Therefore , I would like to receive public and clear confirmation from Commissioner Figel ’ that transferring the commemoration of the victims of terror to the ‘ Citizens for Europe ’ programme will result in the additional funding and attention that it deserves .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we European citizens must take pleasure from the approval of this programme : a cultural programme , renewed for 2007-2013 .
<2en> It demonstrates the importance that the European Union attaches to the citizens , adopting a programme aimed at improving the dissemination of the culture and history of all of the peoples of Europe , at conserving and protecting the cultural heritage of the Union and promoting artistic , literary and audiovisual creativity .
<2en> This programme , furthermore , is essential for facing the challenge of enlargement and also in terms of developing an awareness of European citizenship , because only through the dissemination of our common cultural values can we illustrate the different foundations of our European identity .
<2en> But this programme will also be open to many countries that are not Members of the European Union .
<2en> Given , therefore , the programme ’ s very ambitious objectives , we must have a budget to match .
<2en> In this regard , I believe that the needs defined by the European Cultural Foundation in July 2004 , calling for an annual budget of EUR 315 million , quite reasonably pointed to the need for a more generous budget .
<2en> I therefore support the rapporteur ’ s call for a budget greater than the EUR 408 million proposed by the Commission .
<2en> I would like to end by expressing my satisfaction at the adoption of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions ; my satisfaction at its approval , but above all at the fact that the European Union has spoken with one voice and has demonstrated , once again , that when it acts together it achieves results .
<2en> Please allow me , Mr President , to call on the Member States to ratify this instrument , and the sooner the better , since it represents significant progress in the recognition of cultural and linguistic diversity .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , political parties are a vital element in building and reinforcing a European political sphere .
<2en> They play an important and crucial role in promoting democratic values such as freedom , tolerance , solidarity and gender equality .
<2en> In parallel with this , we require a dialogue with citizens on the future of Europe and , in this context , political parties must play a key role .
<2en> Mr Leinen ’ s report is commendable in its support of European political parties and its recommendation to improve the current situation .
<2en> However , Mr Leinen and our political family have been stopped by the PPE-DE Group from mentioning the vital role of European political parties in furthering the priority of gender equality .
<2en> I should like to ask my colleagues to reconsider this , especially those in the PPE-DE Group , who voted against an amendment in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
<2en> That amendment stated that European political parties should take into account the principle of equal opportunities when filling posts in party offices and on party lists for election .
<2en> We should not forget that women form the majority of our population .
<2en> As President of the PSE ’ s women ’ s group , I am aware of the tremendous work that our political family does in this field throughout the European Parliament .
<2en> Other political parties should be doing the same .
<2en> I urge my colleagues from the PPE-DE Group to rethink their position and to uphold the values of the EU .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , this has very much been a debate about democracy : its strengths , its shortcomings and the challenges that come from a rapidly changing reality .
<2en> Until now , the system we have for exercising and organising democracy goes through political parties .
<2en> That is the way we do it in Europe , at national , local and regional level , and at European level .
<2en> It is not perfect and it requires a constant effort to mobilise people , because we know that the biggest enemy is always ignorance and total apathy .
<2en> That goes for the European level as well .
<2en> We can state that it is no longer enough to leave the decision-making and the democracy to a small political elite ; at least , that is my analysis of the situation .
<2en> We also have to mobilise people at European level to allow for a democratic development also at European level .
<2en> It is through political parties that we can make people accountable , that we can create openness and transparency , and that we can have effective decision-making .
<2en> It is still only embryonic : even if we have succeeded in creating ten European parties , we cannot say that we have succeeded totally .
<2en> However , it has helped and it does not contradict that we also have to invest in making sure that the national parties integrate European affairs into their political agenda , discussions and decisions .
<2en> We have to do both and we have to move on both fronts .
<2en> In addition it is necessary to make sure that there is European media that can cover what goes on .
<2en> This also requires some efforts and promotion from our side , to make sure that the reporting is there as well – for citizens , for democracy , to be able to follow what goes on and to take a position on that .
<2en> I would add that it is also necessary to create meeting places , citizen-to-citizen opportunities to discuss .
<2en> Those three building blocks are necessary to develop democracy at European level .
<2en> It can be virtual or geographical or real , but all three elements are necessary .
<2en> European political parties are a very important element .
<2en> You can discuss the criteria ; we have to discuss the things that have been mentioned here .
<2en> I am very prudent in not promising what could come out of the review of the Financial Regulation now .
<2en> I think it would be very unwise of me to promise that the Commission will come forward at such-and-such a time with a new proposal for this or that .
<2en> It has to come in connection with and after the discussion we are having now on reviewing the Financial Regulation and the implementing rules .
<2en> This can come as a result of that and after that .
<2en> However , I think you have created and presented the elements and building blocks necessary to discuss what to do with European political parties .
<2en> As many have pointed out , however , there is a link to other organisations as well , and we have to take that into account so that it can be a balanced proposal one day .
<2en> It is wise to also have a vision as to when this could be ready , but I cannot make a promise on that on behalf of the Commission today .
<2en> This is a very important debate .
<2en> I welcome the amendments underlining the importance of promoting equality between men and women , and I would point out – as I see Mrs Gurmai there – I think this is absolutely evident .
<2en> Had Mr Allister still been here I would have asked him who he would vote for .
<2en> Would he vote for somebody and be willing to pay for somebody who says ‘ I enter this room or this institution with ambitions and hopes and dreams and I promise to do my best and work for a future for the European Union ’ ?
<2en> Or would you vote for someone who says ‘ I do not believe in this institution , I do not think it should exist , I think it deals with nonsense issues and I am not going to pay too much attention to what goes on here ’ ?
<2en> Who would you be willing to pay for as a normal taxpayer ?
<2en> I think it speaks for itself , but in the end this is really also a matter of the choice that you have to give to people , as Mr Corbett and others have pointed out .
<2en> It is a choice to give to the European citizens and that is , in the end a matter of democracy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , may I apologise to Commissioner Wallström for those Members who deliver their speeches but are not present for the debate .
<2en> That is certainly not the custom in this House .
<2en> I wish to apologise on behalf of my fellow Members .
<sp>
<2en> The debate is closed .
<2en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
<sp>
<2en> The next item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on European contract law and the revision of the acquis : the way forward ( 2005 / 2022 ( INI ) ) ( A6-0055 / 2006 ) .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> As regards my timetable , I can reassure you .
<2en> I shall not be leaving Parliament before tomorrow morning so I have plenty of time .
<2en> I am not sure that is the case for all Members .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to request a clarification , an addition .
<2en> ‘ management expenditure for ’
<2en> the following phrase :
<2en> ‘ any executive agency created or extended to administer this programme ’
<sp>
<2en> Are there any objections to this oral amendment ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I wish to table an oral amendment with the intention of changing recital C. It is a matter of substituting the terms , which I will read out in English as that is the only version I have :
<2en> … ‘ environmental protection ’ by ‘ environmental sustainability ’ …
<2en> I believe these are the recognised terms .
<2en> The text would then read as follows :
<2en> … ‘ whereas there are three main objectives for EU energy policy : security of supply , competitiveness and environmental sustainability ’ .
<sp>
<2en> Are there any objections to this oral amendment ?
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The next item is the debate on two motions for resolutions on Taiwan ( 1 ) .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the World Health Organisation exists to safeguard the health of everyone in the world , without exceptions and without gaps .
<2en> If , as in the case of Taiwan , gaps are imposed for political motives , that can only assist the spread of disease and cause many preventable deaths and considerable suffering to thousands of innocent civilians .
<2en> It is my view that , with all due respect to the Government of the People ’ s Republic of China and without violating any relevant United Nations resolutions , the 23 million Taiwanese people should , for the sake of world health , be allowed to be represented by their own observers in the WHO .
<2en> This would be fully in keeping with the current practice , which allows entities that do not constitute states under international law – such as the Holy See , Palestine and the International Red Cross – to have observer status .
<2en> Such representation will not in any way constitute political recognition of Taiwan as an independent state , but would be done solely to facilitate international public health and in particular to prevent the spread of highly dangerous communicable diseases , such as SARS , avian flu and HIV .
<2en> So , colleagues , let us put the world ’ s health before regional political conflicts , and let us call upon the WHO to show the necessary courage and the People ’ s Republic of China to show the necessary goodwill and allow the observer status participation of Taiwan to go ahead .
<sp>
<2en> . – Mr President , in view of the current context , with the high risk of several infectious diseases spreading across borders , such as bird flu or SARS , it is important that we establish the fastest and most effective possible mechanisms for prevention and response .
<2en> All of the regions of the world must therefore participate directly and freely in the international cooperation networks , forums and programmes in the field of health .
<2en> 23 million people live in Taiwan , but it is not covered by United Nations protection in the event of the outbreak of an epidemic on the island .
<2en> This Resolution therefore urges the Commission and the Council once again to insist that the Chinese Government , taking advantage of the particularly privileged relations we have at the moment , accept that Taiwan should have observer status in the World Health Organisation , or at least in the World Health Assembly .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we do not let any opportunity pass us by in this House to defend human rights and the great principles of democracy , but when it comes to Taiwan , we take a more flexible approach .
<2en> Let us not forget that Taiwan is the only one of the four large Chinese societies in Asia to have both democracy and respect for human rights .
<2en> In the People ’ s Republic of China , there is neither democracy nor respect for human rights ; in Hong Kong , there is respect for human rights but no democracy ; and , in Singapore , there is democracy but no respect for human rights .
<2en> The joint resolution under examination does , however , go far beyond the usual diplomatic disputes .
<2en> Our demand , which centres on Taiwan 's being granted observer status at the World Health Organisation , is a public health issue of the utmost importance .
<2en> It concerns both the 20 million residents of the island and the entire international community , us included .
<2en> Given the issues at stake – among which I will simply mention the dangers of an epidemic that are threatening us – this demand is the bare minimum .
<2en> I call on my fellow Members to think about the consequences of our joint resolution , and to adopt it despite the Socialist Group in the European Parliament ’ s last-minute u-turn .
<2en> I would have welcomed more firmness on this matter from our fellow Members in the PSE .
<2en> Even though they claim to be defenders of democracy and human rights , they were sadly unable to resist demonstrating , in this House , their solidarity with their Chinese Communist comrades .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I genuinely regret what I have just heard - after all , we hear it said so often in this House .
<2en> We can recognise Taiwan 's achievements in the field of health care , as well as its involvement in international activities in that regard .
<2en> From a legal perspective , however , it is not possible for Taiwan to obtain observer status at the World Health Organisation .
<2en> Only States can have that status .
<2en> European policy recognises one China ; the European Parliament supports that position .
<2en> At the time of our previous resolutions on that same issue , which were adopted in 2002 and 2003 , the Commission told us that it would examine the issue of Taiwan ’ s participating in the work of the WHO , in particular through non-State channels , via an NGO for example .
<2en> The Taiwanese authorities are members of the World Medical Association and of the epidemiological training schemes network .
<2en> These two NGOs are themselves members of the WHO Global Outbreak and Alert Network .
<2en> They take part in the warning system .
<2en> Currently , it is wrong to say that Taiwan does not benefit from United Nations protection .
<2en> Nevertheless , we can call on China to examine the issue of Taiwan ’ s contributing to an appropriate field of international cooperation regarding public health .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Thank you too , Mrs Echerer , for your honesty .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would like to declare my economic interest and for this reason I will not be taking part in the vote .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , there will of course be many Members who will have some direct or indirect financial interest in this matter , in most cases to a rather small extent .
<en> Parliament 's Rules of Procedure however state that Members must declare their direct financial interests if they are going to speak in the debate .
<en> I refer to Article 1 of Annex I of our Rules of Procedure .
<en> The Rules do not require us to register such an interest before voting .
<en> If every Member who has an interest is now going to get up and declare it before we start this vote , we will only start the vote at 1.00 p.m.
<en> Such interests are registered in the written declaration of Members ' interests , so they are there for the public to see ; that declaration will also soon be on the Internet following the vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week .
<sp>
<en> Given that this issue is very clearly understood , I think that we can agree that all Members who are in this situation should abstain .
<en> There is no need to declare this before the vote ; if you agree , we shall proceed in this way .
<en> Otherwise , we can continue ; I have a long list of Members who have requested the floor .
<en> I only hope that there will be some Members left to vote .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , as I have declared it to other people already I thought it was only fair to declare it to this House that I will be abstaining because of pecuniary interests .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in September 2003 , following the unprecedented forest fires of the summer that , as you will recall , affected Portugal and a whole host of regions in southern Europe , we took the floor in order to urge the European Union to equip itself with a permanent rapid reaction force .
<2en> We appealed at that time , and we continue to appeal , in the four excellent reports presented to us , not only , I would say , for a little less national self-interest regarding civil protection , but also , as Mrs Estrella proposes in paragraphs 3 and 4 , for example , of her report , for enhanced European cooperation regarding civil protection .
<2en> Mr Wojciechowski broadly addressed this precise point .
<2en> We need enhanced European cooperation for at least two good reasons .
<2en> Firstly , the impact of climate change on the frequency of natural disasters , the torrential rain in northern and eastern Europe , drought and the fires that wreaked havoc last year are there to remind us of the crucial need to act , and to act quickly , on this matter .
<2en> Secondly , the financial cost of these disasters is increasing , and our Member States are having more and more difficulty in meeting it by themselves .
<2en> This is , of course , where the Solidarity Fund comes into its own , as it is designed to cover these emergency costs , such as the provision of water , energy and housing , or the repairing of basic infrastructure .
<2en> I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank Mr Berend , who wants to make it easier immediately to access part of the payments and who also proposes to extend the benefit of the Fund to other types of disaster such as drought or even – as he mentioned – biological or chemical terrorist threats or attacks .
<2en> The European Union will never , of course , succeed in preventing all natural disasters , but our duty is to help the Europeans who are hit by these tragedies and to coordinate our efforts more effectively in such cases .
<2en> That is why , despite the reluctance of some Member States , we must also support the creation of a permanent European civil protection force , the famous ‘ Green Helmets ’ .
<2en> Let us also support the less controversial creation of an operations centre for the management of major crises .
<2en> As you can see , Commissioner - and , in saying this , I am responding to a fear expressed by Mrs Haug , which I share - we are not calling here for more Europe , but for a better Europe .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate all of the rapporteurs and , in particular , Mr Galeote and Mr Berend , on the precision of their reports and the quality of their listening skills .
<2en> I am delighted to observe that an agreement has been concluded between our Parliament and the Commission so as to ensure that the scope of the next Solidarity Fund will from now on cover not only natural disasters , but also industrial accidents , terrorist attacks and major public health crises .
<2en> I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for having supported my amendment , the aim of which is to specify that special attention will be paid to remote or isolated regions , such as island and outermost regions .
<2en> This specification guarantees that , as from 2007 , this Fund can potentially be used in the French Overseas Departments - even if they do not fully meet the general eligibility criteria - so that they can take advantage of emergency aid when a major crisis occurs .
<2en> The own-initiative report by the Committee on Regional Development highlights the devastating effect of these disasters on the economy , employment , national and cultural heritage , the environment and tourism and rightly emphasises the need for effective measures regarding warnings , civil protection and aid for the regions and populations affected .
<2en> I should like to thank the rapporteur for having included my amendments concerning the outermost regions in the European strategy that he so earnestly desires , in the knowledge that , due to their geographical situation , those regions are exposed to natural risks of a specific character and intensity .
<2en> Faced with the numerous threats that regularly place a strain on those regions , from tsunamis to volcanic eruptions , earthquakes to cyclones , and , from now on , the reactivation of mosquito-borne viral diseases , such as chikungunya in Réunion or dengue in Guyana , the overseas populations are awaiting a suitable response from Europe in terms of security , prevention and solidarity .
<2en> Our Parliament is proving today that it has well and truly listened to them .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in my part of Europe floods are the most frequent natural disaster , but this report rightly covers other kinds of natural disasters as well .
<2en> As far as floods are concerned , neighbouring states should act together , as floods , like pollution , do not stop at borders .
<2en> The flood prevention programme , like flood risk maps , should be set up not just for national states but for whole river basins .
<2en> Since the same kinds of disasters happen year after year , we have to make more effort in forecasting and prevention .
<2en> The Solidarity Fund does not work in its present form .
<2en> A new regulation is needed and it should help prevent environmental pollution as a consequence of natural disasters .
<2en> We should not forget that environmental pollution is a very dangerous consequence of natural disasters in general .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , given the limited amount of time available to me , I would like to focus in particular on fires .
<2en> As you know , a delegation visited Spain and Portugal and we were able to witness the scale of the ecological and human tragedy on the ground .
<2en> We were able to hear directly from the sectors affected how the progressive abandonment of rural areas and of traditional activities creates a fertile environment for these disasters .
<2en> We heard complaints from people accusing the competent administrations of abandoning the forests .
<2en> For our part , we must condemn the lack of a genuine policy for fire prevention and the leniency of the penalties relating to the causing of fires .
<2en> If we are to be absolutely thorough in our observations , we must point out that , unfortunately , we have witnessed a lack of coordination between the public administrations responsible , and that , in the case of Guadalajara , this has undoubtedly aggravated the disaster .
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , the victims of these disasters deserve their own chapter .
<2en> In the case in question , they have felt ignored in their own region .
<2en> From a democratic point of view , it is unacceptable that a committee of enquiry should be set up in Castilla-La Mancha but that the families of the victims should have been excluded .
<2en> It has been the European Parliament that has had to come along and put that unspeakable political behaviour right .
<2en> At the hearing held in Brussels to that end , therefore , a representative of the victims spoke and the European Parliament was able to hear their fair demands as the passive victims of a tragedy that has affected their lives .
<2en> At least they have been heard .
<2en> The courts will now decide whether anybody needs to take responsibility , in addition to any political responsibility , which will undoubtedly have to be taken .
<2en> I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for approving an amendment that I presented on the victims and I hope that plenary will vote in favour of it .
<2en> That amendment urges the Commission to provide the resources necessary to alleviate the suffering and meet the material needs of all of the victims of natural disasters and their immediate families , by means of the European Union ’ s Solidarity Fund and other Community instruments .
<2en> Finally , I am very much in favour of the reform of the Solidarity Fund and I hope that the Commission , following the mandate from this Parliament , will present a proposal for a directive for the prevention and management of fires within the European Union .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , the resolutions that we will approve this morning reflect the truth about the important work that Parliament has been doing on the natural disasters affecting the people and territories of the European Union .
<2en> These texts , which represent Parliament ’ s opinion in this field , state what we have always expressed : the need to draw up and implement European policies for the prevention of those disasters , for immediate intervention capable of combating them effectively and for compensating for the damage caused .
<2en> We hope that the Council and the Commission will now take Parliament ’ s proposals into account and respond accordingly , and we shall apply pressure in order to ensure that that happens .
<2en> Nevertheless , the texts that we will approve also highlight the lies and agitation that , in my country specifically , have been demonstrated with regard to this action by the European Parliament , in certain cases and from certain political forces and sectors , even misleading people with regard to its very nature .
<2en> Here today in this very debate we have heard untrue statements – half truths are always untrue – which are entirely contrary to Parliament ’ s opinion , which is expressed by means of the texts we are to approve and nothing more .
<2en> There is an insistence on a partisan and self-interested approach to dealing with disasters and the pain they cause for so many people , in my region , Castilla-La Mancha , for example .
<2en> This kind of behaviour speaks for itself , and perfectly illustrates the nature of the people indulging in it .
<2en> I have no doubt that our citizens will be able to identify the culprits .
<2en> We are sad about the effects of disasters that have struck us hard and we are sad that we have not dedicated enough time , energy and courage to rejecting this regrettable manipulation .
<2en> Nevertheless , our confidence in our men and women , our commitment to the truth and our dedication to making the proposals that Parliament will approve today a reality will be our best legacy .
<2en> That is what we have worked for , that is what we are still working on , and we will continue to do so .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , justice requires reason and prudence .
<2en> So while racism , xenophobia , anti-Semitism and dislike of Muslims or Christians are lamentable facts of life in certain European countries , we have to be very careful when comparing and generalising these phenomena in the course of political debate .
<2en> Otherwise , we may achieve the opposite of what we intended and contribute to aggravating rather than calming the conflict .
<2en> The motion for a resolution on racism and homophobia contains too many contradictions and unjustified generalisations and this can have just such an effect .
<2en> It is not right to throw racism and so-called homophobia and Islamophobia into the same pot .
<2en> That is mixing real discrimination based on race or religion with an opposition towards ideology , which is justified in democratic political discourse .
<2en> Our liberal colleague from the Netherlands is quite humble when it comes to assessing tolerance in her country .
<2en> Recently a paedophile political party was legalised there and I would like to ask : how much further will tolerance go in that country ?
<2en> The post-Communists who are speaking so freely here would do better to look at their own record of tolerance instead of picking on Poland .
<2en> It is grotesque that this resolution juxtaposes regret over the lack of comparable data on the phenomena mentioned above and general judgments about the countries where they manifest themselves .
<2en> Why should Parliament publicise its sloppy work in this superficial draft of such an important document if we have been dealing with these phenomena for many years in committees within the Council of Europe ?
<2en> In ratifying paragraphs 1 , 3 , 4 and 11 in the current version , Parliament would simply lose credibility in the fight against racism and discrimination .
<2en> I would like to appeal to all those of you who are motivated by genuine concern for justice to avoid false comparisons and unjustified generalisations .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , this is an important day for the European Parliament because this debate , and especially the resolution potentially resulting from it , may create a new trend in the just fight against all kinds of racism and persecution of minorities .
<2en> However , let us for God ’ s sake not allow it to become another weapon in the political campaign conducted by the left and the European liberals against the political parties that lean towards the right and countries where right-wing parties have come into power .
<2en> I strongly protest against the proposed formulation in paragraph 4 of the resolution , which levels serious allegations at my country .
<2en> They are deadly serious allegations from a moral and political point of view and include xenophobia , anti-Semitism , homophobia and a lack of tolerance in Poland .
<2en> One thousand years of Polish history surely prove beyond all doubt that Poland is the most tolerant country in Europe .
<2en> It is a country that will never allow its good name to be dragged through the mud with impunity .
<2en> We protest against the lies and hypocrisy of the left .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mr Schulz , together with his socialist colleagues , has joined the ranks of the Polish post-Communists in kicking up a fuss about the fate of homosexuals in Poland .
<2en> Does he know of any cases of intolerance towards homosexuals ?
<2en> If not , what is all the fuss about ?
<2en> Apparently a member of the League of Polish Families advocated the use of violence against gays .
<2en> This allegation is now the subject of a complaint filed by the member against the newspaper which printed the claim .
<2en> This Parliament would make itself a laughing stock if it were to protest against a statement that was never made .
<2en> We must check our facts first .
<2en> He said that the police should prevent illegal demonstrations , by force if necessary .
<2en> When the post-Communists were in power , illegal gay parades were protected by the police .
<2en> Now they are not .
<2en> We have a government that is determined to uphold law and order .
<2en> Yes , we are against promoting homosexuality in Poland .
<2en> We are against promoting immoral behaviour .
<2en> We clearly differ from Mr Schulz in our judgment of what is or is not morally acceptable .
<2en> He would be better off fighting intolerance in his own country .
<2en> I am old enough to remember German intolerance towards Poles during the Second World War .
<2en> There are still examples of lamentable intolerance in Germany today .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to support the statement made by Mr Gaubert , my colleague from the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , that this House has missed the opportunity to speak with one voice and to support the resolution he has drawn up .
<2en> This document highlights the kind of mechanisms that should be introduced in the European Union : constant monitoring of racist crimes , the introduction of a framework directive and the creation of an Agency for Fundamental Rights as soon as possible .
<2en> These should be priorities in our debate and in our resolution , rather than the slinging of mud at certain countries and cases , as seems to be happening here .
<2en> The European Union is trying to uphold the highest human rights standards .
<2en> That is the aim of the Agency for Fundamental Rights which is to be set up soon .
<2en> Already , a report is published annually by the Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia on the subject of racism and xenophobia in the European Union .
<2en> It is worth looking at the 2005 report .
<2en> Under point 5 on racist violence and crime there is an assessment of the situation in the 25 Member States .
<2en> What can we learn from this text ?
<2en> In four European countries , including Italy , Mrs Agnoletto , there is a lack of publicly accessible official data on incidents of racist crime and violence .
<2en> Amongst the new Member States , the report states , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland and Slovakia collect official data on racist violence and crime on a broader scale than other countries .
<2en> We lack a unified European system for registering these crimes , and this makes it difficult to carry out comparable analyses of this phenomenon .
<2en> Over 52 000 incidents of a racist nature have been registered in the United Kingdom , thanks to an efficient system for recording such statistics , 6 400 incidents have been registered in Germany , 1 565 in France and 209 in the Czech Republic .
<2en> This disproportion shows how important it is to introduce a unified monitoring system .
<2en> The majority of the 25 European Union Member States , we read , have transposed the Anti-Discrimination Directive into their own national contexts .
<2en> In July 2000 complaints were filed at the European Court of Justice against four countries , including Germany , Mr Schulz , for not fulfilling their obligations concerning the directives on racial equality .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , our duty today is to make a commitment , to speak out against this return to hate , xenophobia and homophobia .
<2en> All over Europe we are horrified to see odious acts and we are hearing hateful words and incitements to violence .
<2en> I would repeat : all over Europe .
<2en> It is therefore our duty to say ‘ that is enough ’ , that we will not tolerate any more such acts of violence , that these horrendous attitudes are contrary to our values and the foundations upon which we have built our Europe .
<2en> We must put an end to racist , xenophobic and homophobic crimes for good , whether they be against a man or a woman because they are black , against a young man because he is Jewish , against a young man because he is North African or against a woman because she is trans-sexual .
<2en> It is our essential duty to silence all of those who preach this vile ideology .
<2en> We all know where it leads : to the abyss and to horror .
<2en> Furthermore , we must stand firm against the incitements to hate expressed by Polish leaders against homosexuals .
<2en> To this end , I welcome the tolerance and the joy of living together shown by the Polish people on the occasion of the Gay Pride event in Warsaw .
<2en> This is my solemn appeal : let us stand up , for these are grave times .
<2en> All we have to do is count the resolutions that we have adopted on this issue to little effect , since the situation has only worsened .
<2en> We must now move on to actions .
<2en> The States must mobilise themselves against the hate that is re-emerging on their soil .
<2en> The Union must accept the seriousness of the situation and make this fight a priority .
<2en> We will not be able to say in the future that we did not know what was happening .
<2en> It is now that we must act , all of us together , urgently and without delay .
<2en> I would therefore call upon the Member States to reach an agreement on the framework decision on racism and xenophobia as soon as possible .
<2en> The time has come to act .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Good preparation is of vital importance in preventing or containing disasters .
<2en> It is for that reason that I support the report aimed at making cross-border assistance as effective as possible .
<2en> Combating crime and protecting law and order falls essentially within the competence of the Member States .
<2en> This proposal is solely aimed at improving cooperation between the different Member States in this area by establishing a uniform , transparent and effective framework for the exchange of information .
<2en> It is primarily aimed at maintaining law and order and security and preventing and combating criminal offences during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State .
<2en> Every year , before 31 January , the Council is to produce a review of international assistance provided during the previous calendar year .
<2en> The review will comprise an overview of the international events that have taken place , an overview of the assistance provided and received and an overview of the main difficulties observed by the Member States and recommendations as to how such difficulties could be resolved .
<2en> This will ensure that national police forces work in the most effective way possible .
<sp>
<2en> There can be no doubt that the only effective way of combating organised crime and crime tourism is by strengthening cross-border police cooperation .
<2en> In this connection , the Schengen Information System , or SIS , in particular , seems to have proved itself in everyday policing .
<2en> Indeed , owing to its speed , many alerts are now being sent only via the SIS and no longer via Interpol .
<2en> On the other hand , we now have a juxtaposition of multiple forms of police cooperation : Schengen , Europol , Eurodac , CIS , many forms of bilateral cooperation and now the Prüm Convention , too .
<2en> This gives rise to the question as to whether we may now be seeing some unnecessary overlaps here , and also whether we may be starting to lose sight of the overall picture .
<2en> In any case , we must also ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the protection of personal data .
<sp>
<2en> – New measures to strike at the grassroots struggle at national and European level are proposed in the report on the strengthening of cross-border police cooperation at international EU events .
<2en> It insultingly provides for a ' calendar of international events ' to be held every year in order to programme and organise cooperation between the repressive mechanisms of the ΕU used to combat grassroots movements .
<2en> Thus preventive repression is being promoted within the framework of the more general imperialist doctrine of preventive war at home and abroad , in the objective of ' protecting ' summits and all kinds of international meetings of imperialist organisations from the enemy the people .
<2en> The people of Europe have first-hand knowledge of the murderous action of the EU 's repressive mechanisms in Gothenburg , in Genoa and in other countries .
<2en> Every day they have to deal with restrictions on their most fundamental rights and freedoms .
<2en> The Greek Communist Party voted against the report .
<2en> It will help to develop a movement of resistance from the working-class and grassroots movement at national and European level to defend grassroots freedoms .
<2en> Defiance , disobedience and the abolition in practice of the decisions of the ΕU and governments abolishing vested democratic rights are the right and obligation of the peoples .
<sp>
<2en> I will be voting for this report , but the whole fate of inland waterway vessels in the UK is currently under threat .
<2en> The UK has a derogation from the Energy Products Directive which allows the country 's recreational boat owners to fill up their vessels with red diesel , taxed at 6.44 pence per litre .
<2en> This derogation is due to expire on 31 December 2006 , and in a Communication from the Commission to the Council on 30 June 2006 , the Commission indicated it did not believe an extension to this derogation to be justified .
<2en> The benefits of ending this derogation are unclear .
<2en> As leisure boaters ' red diesel usage makes up less than 0.05 % of the country 's diesel consumption , the environmental benefits are essentially negligible .
<2en> There is no evidence to suggest that the UK derogation affects or skews the internal European market .
<2en> Loss of the derogation will put a hobby and an industry at great risk .
<2en> A survey by the Royal Yachting Association reveals that 54 % of boaters ' would or may ' be forced to give up boating due to the sudden price rise .
<2en> The knock-on effects could seriously damage the 30 000 people employed in the boat industry , the 70 000 people whose jobs are supported by marine tourism and the GBP 700 million spent by boaters every year .
<2en> The UK requires a final five-year extension to address these issues .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to speak about the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation .
<2en> This regulation provides for a range of technical provisions that will have a far-reaching impact on safety , which in general terms is to be welcomed .
<2en> Some regulations on emissions , flight time limitations and administration are inadequate , however , and should be viewed in the broader context .
<2en> Any moves towards further taxation on fuel or services would limit free competition among new airlines and airports .
<2en> It should be remembered that in addition to improving safety and the quality of services , we must also ensure that entrepreneurship is facilitated , that bureaucracy is stripped away and that the cost of air transport is cut .
<2en> Mobility is one of the prerequisites of economic growth and the rising cost of air transport would put us at a competitive disadvantage in the global market .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> – Achieving a European common policy on immigration and asylum is undoubtedly a priority , although the Member States have so far shown varying degrees of willingness to address the problem .
<2en> However , the need to tackle the problem of illegal immigration is , in my view , even more urgent .
<2en> Despite the institutions ’ repeated calls for cooperation , the main burden of this still falls on the Member States located on the European Union ’ s natural borders .
<2en> Practical solutions therefore need to be found urgently to contain and regulate the problem .
<2en> Coordinating the border forces of the various Member States is useful but not enough .
<2en> The idea of setting up a joint border task force is certainly the most appropriate solution , and I am grateful to the Finnish Presidency for mentioning it .
<2en> Not least , dialogue with and support for those countries from which the immigrants come and those through which they pass on their way to Europe are absolutely essential for any lasting , effective solution .
<2en> I hope that the forthcoming presidencies , starting with Germany , which receives a large proportion of the immigrants filtering through from the southern borders , will tackle the issue firmly and achieve a consensus on this subject , which closely affects all Europeans as well as the Union ’ s delicate social balance .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the distinguished visitors ’ gallery members of a Chinese delegation led by Deputy Minister Qiu Yuanping .
<2en> Mrs Qiu is Deputy Minister of the Central Foreign Affairs Office of the People ’ s Republic of China .
<2en> The delegation is here to meet a number of political groups as well as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade and the chairmen of the Delegation for relations with the People ’ s Republic of China and the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
<2en> I wish them an instructive stay in the European Parliament .

<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I very much welcome the visit of the Prime Minister of Lebanon this afternoon , but I very much regret that the Question Time session with the Council has had to be abandoned to make room for this , with no attempt by the Conference of Presidents to reschedule it to another time .
<2en> Question Time is one of the important democratic traditions of this House .
<2en> It is the one opportunity we have to question the Council on issues of concern to us and our constituents .
<2en> It is central to our work .
<2en> This is the second time this year that this session has been arbitrarily cancelled .
<2en> Can I urge you , please , to make sure that there is no third repeat of this .

<en> Mr President , people may be trying to change the vote , or whatever , but I actually voted the wrong way because of the roll-call vote .

<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , it is surely essential for votes to reveal the wishes of this House , that is to say , the wishes of the Members of this Parliament .
<en> Due to a mistake , or an oversight , a significant number of MEPs failed to vote according to their wishes .
<en> I therefore make a formal request for the vote to be taken again .
<en> There is no risk involved , as the House will simply indicate what its true wishes are .

<en> Please , we are dealing with a serious and important issue .

<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , regardless of one 's opinion on this vote , I have one comment , and I would like the chairmen of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats to respond to this : what has been said here is a gross impertinence that the whole of Parliament should condemn .
<en> This President was elected by a large majority , and he has the right to lead every vote , whether you like it or not .
<en> Anything else is impertinent and obscene !
<en> ( Applause from the left )
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I simply wished to refer to your reply to the Vice-President of Parliament , Mr Vidal-Quadras , to the effect that it falls to the President of the European Parliament to interpret the Rules of Procedure .
<en> Rule 159 ( 1 ) of Parliament 's Rules of Procedure states that Parliament will normally vote by show of hands , and Rule 159 ( 2 ) says that ' if the President decides that the result is doubtful , a fresh vote shall be taken using the electronic voting system ' .
<en> Mr President , you proceeded to an electronic vote before any result was known and that has led to confusion .
<en> Mr President , two months remain of your mandate in this Parliament .
<en> Do not compromise your independence or prestige , because neither you nor this Parliament deserve that .
<en> ( Mixed reactions )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted against Amendment 811 , which refers to the Committee on Budgets ' rural development programmes , and against Amendment 3 to paragraph 23 , because they restrict funding for rural development and block ' voluntary modulation ' under the terms in which it is proposed by the Commission .
<sp>
<en> in writing .
<en> This budget again fails to find the money to meet our commitments , particularly in relation to our emerging common foreign and security policy and our development policy .
<en> The EU 's ability to play a global role is being hampered by ' bean-counters ' back in our national capital .
<en> For this they bear a heavy responsibility .
<en> On two details I will be voting against the amendment from our ultra-nationalistic and Catholic fundamentalists from Poland urging opposition to forced or ' coercive ' abortions .
<en> Of course I am opposed to such an idea , but the EU is not supporting such a programme .
<en> Rather it is an attempt to introduce US evangelical Christian bigotry into EU development policy and must be opposed for that very reason .
<en> Second , I want proper control of spending and value for money .
<en> Yet some pursue these demands as a way of tying Commission staff into overly-bureaucratic regulations that hamper and hinder work , rather than assist .
<sp>
<en> in writing .
<en> ( SV ) The June List believes that the EU 's budget should be limited to 1 % of the Member States ' average GNI .
<en> I have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament , at the same time as the June List has welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by either the Committee on Budgets or individual Members .
<en> There are quite a few unfortunate budget headings , but the June List particularly regrets the large amount of aid for the EU 's agricultural policy , Cohesion Fund and fishing industry , as well as the budget headings under which various forms of information campaign are to be subsidised .
<en> The June List also believes that something must be done about the European Parliament 's constant commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be closed down .
<en> This week ( beginning 23 October 2006 ) , the EU 's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth time in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EU 's budget was being used correctly or for the purposes intended .
<en> How can this madness continue whereby , year after year , financial resources are appropriated , only a small portion of which can be guaranteed to be used for the purposes for which they were intended ?
<sp>
<2en> Whilst we wish to restate our opposition to key aspects of the negotiating strategy and of the priorities established by Parliament on the Community 's 2007 Budget , we also feel we must advocate the adoption of some of our proposals , which are aimed at :
<2en> increasing the appropriation earmarked for the European Social Fund convergence .
<2en> promoting cooperation and the establishment of associations between micro , small and medium-sized enterprises ;
<2en> protecting and preserving the forests , with measures and actions to monitor and prevent forest fires ;
<2en> promoting , preserving and protecting cultural heritage , such as the Cistercian Route and UNESCO world heritage sites .
<2en> promoting cooperation between farming organisations and other stakeholders in rural areas , with a view to revitalising those areas ; and promoting family , small-scale and medium-sized farming , and farming among young people .
<2en> carrying out studies or reports into child labour in the EU , relocations and employment , the single currency , the price of essential goods and bank charges and commissions , and the impact of new technologies on the work place and on work-related illnesses ;
<2en> providing information on , and clarification of , the rights of people employed in seasonal work outside their country of origin .
<sp>
<en> in writing .
<en> We are opposing a continued expansion of the EU-budget , which today is already too extensive with a large part of the funds going to the wrong ends .
<en> Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing via EU .
<en> These mean new demands on payments from the Member States , but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic , inefficient and complex .
<en> However , there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget , and we support reasonable changes of existing means .
<en> But our opposition to a constantly increasing budget is firm , and therefore we have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote .

<en> ( HU ) If we had to sum up in one sentence the Phare report by the European Court of Auditors , it would go something like this : the 806 million euro allocated to Romania from the available funding was largely a waste of money .
<en> The results of the inspection by the Court of Auditors show that the projects were carried out , but the majority of them operate in a way that differs from the intended purposes , and in the majority of the projects audited , sustainability is simply not possible .
<en> The ' technical errors ' and ' shortcomings ' listed in the report are unfortunately the source of no small irritation on the part of European investors .
<en> The contracts are systematically misinterpreted by the Romanian parties , and therefore they make it impossible for EU investments to be completed on time and the expenses accounted for .
<en> Delays in implementing the projects give rise to overtime and overtime costs , which the Romanian party is not prepared to pay for .
<en> Meanwhile , the authorities are continually changing their decisions and the regulatory background , as well as the way these are interpreted .
<en> I wonder who bears responsibility for the Romanian state having spent the money , but not in the way and for the purposes for which it was received ?
<en> In recent days , Hungarian language signs put up on the walls of the trilingual Babes-Bolyai University were taken down by the administration , and roughly broken up in front of the students .
<en> I would like to know why , only days before Romania joins the European Union , one may not put up a ' No Smoking ' sign in Hungarian ?
<en> It is my hope that one of the first acts of the Romanian Commissioner will be to call upon his country 's authorities to restore linguistic freedom as soon as possible , as an indication to his commitment to the EU .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , colleagues , Romania 's accession to the European Union can be considered a historically significant step forward , which brings fundamental changes that will have a beneficial effect on the country 's population as well as on the development of the European Union .
<en> In recent years Romania underwent very rapid development in both the economic and judicial spheres .
<en> I believe , however , that the struggle against corruption and organised crime still exhibits serious delays : therefore tangible results are needed in the matter of human trafficking and in particular the trafficking of women .
<en> The European Union today is not only an economic but also a social , political and cultural community , where the protection of fundamental human rights must receive explicit emphasis , as must the struggle against every form of intolerance , racism and discrimination .
<en> Romania should devote attention more decisively to protecting the Roma and the Hungarian communities .
<en> It is important to improve living conditions for the Roma minority , and to enable them to have access to jobs and appropriate resources .
<en> I believe that only a policy of zero tolerance can be followed with regard to racism against the Roma , while greater efforts are needed in the area of equal access to high quality education and health care .
<en> Protection of the Hungarian minority can be ensured only through measures harmonised with the principles of subsidiarity and self-government .
<en> It would be important for Hungarian students in higher education to receive full financial support .
<en> I welcome Romania 's imminent accession to the European Union , and thereby the improvement of the situation of Hungarians living in that country .
<en> We cannot allow that in the course of accession , economic interests should win out over human rights .

<en> As this is the first time I have presided over this House , allow me to start by thanking you for your applause , for your welcome and for the trust you have placed in me .
<en> The final draft agenda has been distributed .
<en> The following amendment has been proposed :
<en> Wednesday :
<en> I have received , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , a request for the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Pervenche Berès on greater convergence of supervisory practices at European Union level ( Ο-0126 / 2006 - Β6-449 / 2006 ) , which was planned for today 's debate , to be postponed to a later sitting , so that it can be examined jointly with the oral question to the Council on the same subject .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should like to congratulate you on your election .
<2en> The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to put a question both to the Council and to the Commission regarding the convergence of supervisory practices .
<2en> However , the question to the Council has clearly got lost in the preparations for the Conference of Presidents .
<2en> We are still happy to be able to debate these kinds of subjects with the Commission , but there is a major issue at stake in the matter that we are discussing , including for the German Presidency .
<2en> We are therefore counting on its support to find a slot in the agenda of one of our forthcoming sittings so that we can deal at the same time with the oral question submitted to the Commission and with the one submitted to the Council on this absolutely crucial issue of the convergence of supervisory practices in the field of financial markets .
<2en> I am also counting on the support of the presidency of this Parliament to obtain a good slot for this debate .
<2en> ( Parliament approved the requested postponement )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , I should just like to say that , following the adoption of this oral amendment , our group is withdrawing Amendment 261 .
<en> - After the vote on paragraph 66
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , I believe that it is in everybody 's interest for the groups to vote as they have decided to do .
<en> The fact that the amendments of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group have been withdrawn from the voting list is currently causing confusion amongst many Members ; they think that they are voting on the Union for Europe of the Nations Group 's amendments when in fact the vote relates to the original paragraphs .
<en> I would therefore ask you to carry out an electronic verification of the vote on the original paragraph 66 , and I would ask the honourable Members always to check whether the vote relates to the original or to the amendment .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , what is making voting more than usually difficult is the fact that my headset is telling me that we are voting on 66 , the screen is saying the same thing , and you are saying 68 .
<en> We ought , I think , to be hearing the same thing from you as we are told by the screen and over the sound system .
<en> ( Voting time was suspended at 12 noon to make way for the formal sitting , and resumed at 12.30 p.m. )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , everyone is talking first and foremost about the recent Summit 's historic significance in terms of protecting the climate and the environment , but in so doing they overlook the fact that in other important fields , such as employment policy and the European social model , no initiatives have been agreed at all and that as a result opportunities have been missed .
<en> The Lisbon Strategy with its focus on the global competitiveness of the European Union and other global players prevents us , in my view , from adopting an effective approach both to the fight for climate protection and to the fight against poverty and social exclusion .
<en> However , I certainly appreciate that on climate protection steps have been taken in the right direction .
<en> Nevertheless , it is obvious that these steps are limited and that they are still in danger of being slowed down and brought to a halt .
<en> The EU is once again its own worst enemy , pushing to one side its own studies which conclude that a 30 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is needed to actually prevent irreversible global warming and with it up to 86 000 additional climate-related deaths per year in the EU .
<en> The difference between 30 % and 20 % can be summed up as whether we are going to use the opportunity to avert a climate catastrophe or whether we are going to carry on regardless .
<en> The problem is not that the left-wing opposition believes in principle that those in power are not doing enough of the right thing .
<en> The problem is that the wrong political course has been adopted and that the decisive initiatives are not actually being taken .
<en> It is not surprising either that the fight against poverty , social exclusion and social divisions continued to be marginalised at the Summit and was not linked at all with consistent action to tackle global warming and the destruction of the environment .
<en> Mr Verheugen , it is precisely this close interlinkage of social and ecological issues that the Summit failed to identify , despite what you have said today .
<en> For years , the European Commission has presented reports showing the potential jobs that could be created by using renewable energies , showing the external costs , but also clarifying the impact of ecotaxes .
<en> Levying these taxes could increase the European Union 's revenue , money which is needed for imperative social and environmental measures .
<en> This market logic explains why , for example , in the Action Plan ' An Energy Policy for Europe ' tackling climate change is only included at the bottom of the list of major objectives .
<en> It also explains why the European Council is calling for rapid progress to be made in the EPA negotiations , despite the Summit 's complaint about the increasing share of greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries .
<en> These free-trade agreements are , in my opinion , a brutal form of neo-colonialism , which are socially and environmentally destructive .
<en> There are at least three conclusions : firstly , we need to make it a priority to have an up-to-date policy to tackle poverty and social exclusion and global warming , then we need to stop the EPAs and finally we need the passages in the draft constitution that promote economic deregulation , privatisation and armament to be deleted .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , greenhouse gas emissions are a source of concern and appear to lead to rapid changes to the earth 's climate .
<en> It is difficult to form a judgment on what the EU might do about this matter by itself .
<en> By taking the lead , we should increase our ability to put pressure on China , India , the United States and Russia , and Europe would gain the advantage in terms of environmental technology .
<en> However , we must not proceed too quickly and so undermine our competitiveness .
<en> The Council agreed on a well-balanced view of this issue - rare progress in an EU in which the vast majority of decisions undermine freedom , weaken democracy , compromise countries ' independence and make our lives more bureaucratic .
<en> It should also be noted , however , that such progress destroys the official argument in favour of the Constitutional Treaty .
<en> According to that argument , democracy must give way to efficiency and it must be possible for individual Member States to be ridden roughshod over in the EU 's decision-making ; otherwise , the EU will become impotent .
<en> That is apparently untrue .
<en> Nor was it true of the Services Directive .
<en> The hidden argument in favour of the Constitutional Treaty is that it is necessary in order to create an EU state - a power base for a new European elite .
<en> Political power has to be taken away from the nation states , which are the source and basis of European democracy .
<en> Now , the Council has again shown that it is possible to take major decisions even when all the Member States have the veto .
<en> Thank you for demonstrating that .
<en> Praeterea censeo constitutionum esse repudiendam [ Moreover , I believe that the Constitution should be rejected . ]
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , we too regard the EU Summit as positive , but more in terms of its desires than its results .
<en> On the one hand it is good and important for the future of all of us that climate protection targets were agreed at the EU Summit , but on the other hand it is , alas , the case that such declarations are unfortunately often not even worth the paper they are written on .
<en> What is the point of agreeing to reduce CO2 emissions by a fifth by 2020 if the practical and problematic details are , in usual EU style , put off until later .
<en> Moreover , I do not think that we have made any progress at all on nuclear power .
<en> The question of how to dispose of radioactive waste remains unresolved , the safety of nuclear power stations is not guaranteed and the effects of nuclear radiation are not at all fully understood .
<en> Nevertheless , the EU Summit did not manage to send out a clear signal by reducing nuclear energy .
<en> Instead the danger of global warming is supposed to be countered with a nuclear risk , which I believe is a perilous business .
<en> It is of course all well and good if the EU wishes to play a leading role in climate protection .
<en> However , it is only responsible for 15 % of global carbon dioxide emissions , which is just the tip of the iceberg .
<en> On our own , without the major climate culprits , India , China , South Korea , Japan , Australia and the United States which are responsible for almost half of global greenhouse gas production , we will hardly be able to make progress in the battle against climate change .
<en> On the contrary , we will pay a hefty price for all our efforts .
<en> You do not need a prophet to tell you that .
<en> The fact that the developing countries , but also and above all the energy-squandering USA , could not care less about the environment , is well known .
<en> Even on US Army bases in Europe no respect is shown for the environment and abandoned US bases are almost akin to hazardous waste depots .
<en> This is a scandal , not only for the Americans , whom it seems really do need to be taken in hand in this respect , but above all for the EU Member States , who have not prescribed any technical environmental conditions .
<en> This is another context in which critical questions need to be asked about transatlantic relations , just as they do in respect of CIA overflights and our overall tendency , all too blind with euphoria , to be the Americans ' vassals .
<en> As early as 1997 the industrialised countries committed themselves to reducing the quantity of greenhouse gases that they produce .
<en> At the 2005 UN Climate Change Conference there was once again praise for moves to invest more in solar , wind and hydroelectric energy from then on .
<en> Of course once again these noble words have been followed by scant action .
<en> The EU imposed its own target to increase the share of renewable energy to 12 % but has achieved only 8 % .
<en> That is why there is no need to celebrate renewed verbal declarations , like the ones we have just heard again , as such a great success .
<en> Instead we are reminded of other EU initiatives that have failed thus far such as the Lisbon objectives , which we are also still light years away from achieving , quite apart from the barely implemented Alpine Convention , which is a further act in this tragedy .
<en> If we are to slow down climate change and mitigate its impending serious consequences we must all direct our efforts towards achieving the objectives that we have set .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , ever since I came to this House , I have heard repeated promises of cutting red tape , be it from the Commission , the Council or indeed from Parliament itself .
<en> From this summit , we have now yet another war declared on bureaucracy .
<en> That is good .
<en> Indeed , one wishes that famed German efficiency would drive it forward .
<en> However , I fear that will not happen , because , as in the past , I suspect that these promises will not be delivered .
<en> This is because we are dealing with EU edifices which are veritable factories of regulation .
<en> Indeed , at the same summit , a whole new front of regulation was opened up under the guise of tackling climate change - even down to the point of dictating the type of light bulbs that nation states and citizens can use !
<en> Where , one might ask , are these bulbs likely to be manufactured ?
<en> Probably in China , thanks , in part , to over-regulation driving our manufacturers to take flight eastwards , where the uncontrolled factories manufacturing them will belch out even greater CO2 emissions .
<en> Frankly , we never enforce restrictions about such matters in our trade agreements with China .
<en> Rather , we seem to reserve such punitive measures for our own industry .
<en> Such is the self-defeating merry-go-round that is this regulation-crazed European Union .
<en> Speaking of merry-go-rounds brings me to the manoeuvrings at the summit over the rejected Constitution .
<en> So , Chancellor Merkel thinks EU citizens can be bypassed and hoodwinked : if the title ' Constitution ' is dropped , then we can avoid even asking the electorate .
<en> What a coup for democracy !
<en> What a cowardly farce !
<en> What a commentary on the EU elite and their arrogant contempt for the people whose interests they claim to serve .
<en> The fact that the EU is running away from its own citizens tells us all we need to know about its worth and value as we approach the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , which , of course , spawned this insatiable lust for Brussels domination and control .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his report .
<en> It is true that it was a successful summit , and as always success has many fathers , while failure is a foundling .
<en> In this case the success was primarily due to Germany 's Chancellor , Mrs Merkel , who was after all Environment Minister for four years many years ago and is familiar with the European Environment Council .
<en> The focus was on energy and climate policy .
<en> Unfortunately , the public debate following this successful summit has only described the internal discussions about renewable energies .
<en> In fact , as the Council Conclusions attest , much more was decided on the issues of security of energy supply and climate impact .
<en> The impact on society of the proposals made is also important and if we set targets , for example 20 % or 30 % , then these targets have to be realistic .
<en> Mr Schulz praised Mr Blair for his 60 % target .
<en> Mr Blair will not have to implement that , as we all know , and I am sure that his Conservative challengers will be demanding 70 % by tomorrow at the latest .
<en> These targets must therefore be realistic ; otherwise they are of no real value .
<en> Secondly , despite all of this success there are still some outstanding issues , such as the question of burden-sharing .
<en> I hope that the Commission and the German Presidency will comment on this before the middle of the year .
<en> What is the role of nuclear energy ?
<en> We cannot proceed as was stated in the internal German discussion .
<en> It is a fact that generating one kilowatt-hour from nuclear energy produces 15 grams of CO2 whereas generating one kilowatt-hour from brown coal produces 970 grams .
<en> We must therefore be open-minded when debating this .
<en> I certainly believe that at the end of the day the success of the German Presidency will be judged on whether it is possible , in international negotiations with the United States , Russia , India and China , to convert this European benchmark into an international standard .
<en> If so , the German Presidency will leave a lasting legacy .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly , I am pleased for both rapporteurs that their reports have met with such broad approval , not only in the Committee but also here in Parliament .
<2en> It shows that we are all of the opinion that an accelerated process of change on the internal European financial markets must also have consequences for our political work .
<2en> Of course , this was also highlighted in the report by the Committee of Wise Men on European securities markets regulation chaired by Mr Lamfalussy , which we will be debating later on this week .
<2en> A second piece of evidence for this change is the exponential growth in the volume of shares , of over 30 % each year between 1995 and 1999 .
<2en> This is of prime importance , owing to the strategic significance of well-functioning financial markets for increasing economic prosperity in the EU .
<2en> When the investment services directive is upgraded , three aims must be taken into account simultaneously : firstly , speeding up market integration ; secondly , improving the level of protection afforded to investors , and thirdly , market stability .
<2en> On the one hand this benefits the markets and on the other it protects investors .
<2en> In this way , financial stability will be safeguarded in the future .
<2en> Two further points , which have also already been mentioned , are of concern to me here .
<2en> Firstly , a fully operational European passport needs to be created for investment firms .
<2en> In order to use this opportunity and remove the existing obstacles to its introduction , we urgently need to move over to the country-of-origin principle .
<2en> For major investors this should happen as quickly as possible and for small investors - Mrs Kauppi has already referred to this - the same principle applies but transitional arrangements will probably be necessary .
<2en> An additional issue in this context is the harmonisation of conduct of business rules , which is a prerequisite for a healthy internal market .
<2en> My second concern is that there should be genuine competition between stock exchanges and trading platforms .
<2en> To make fair competition possible an appropriate and efficient system of supervision needs to be set up .
<2en> This should avoid competition being determined and thus distorted by differing rules and the ensuing hunt for the more favourable regulatory framework .
<2en> There is a trend towards ever increasing investments in securities - we also talk about this in connection with pension funds - and that is why I would recommend speedy adoption and implementation , hopefully before 2005 .
<2en> This too would be in line with the Lamfalussy report .
<sp>
<en> I thank both Mr Katiforis and Mrs Kauppi for the reports which they have produced .
<en> They reflect a very large measure of agreement .
<en> It is good to hear that speakers have supported these two reports .
<en> The Commission has also taken cognisance of these two reports with great pleasure .
<en> It is well-known that the investment services directive is the bedrock of the EU legislative framework in the field of securities markets .
<en> That directive defines common regulatory parameters for investor protection and orderly markets .
<en> Five years after its entry into force it is now time to test its roadworthiness .
<en> The Commission believes that the judgment must be mitigated .
<en> While there have been significant improvements , cross-border provision of investment services continues to be dogged by legal uncertainty and impediments .
<en> More fundamentally , the securities trading environment has undergone seismic shifts which pose new challenges for EU regulation .
<en> The Commission welcomes the timely and coherent responses of the European Parliament to the two communications on the investment services directive .
<en> The reports provide clear pointers for the Commission when it prepares its proposal for a modification of the ISD which is due for adoption by the end of this year .
<en> I will now mention a few specific points which are contained in the report prepared by Mrs Kauppi .
<en> The most immediate and tangible objective of the ISD remains the provision of a single passport for investment firms .
<en> The Kauppi report cogently addresses the principal hurdle to be overcome , which is the overlapping and conflicting national rules for conduct of business .
<en> The approach outlined in the communication in Article 11 has been constrained by the inherent ambiguity of the provision and the absence of relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice .
<en> Despite this , the communication sends a clear message , that the cross-border provision of investment services to professional investors should already be subject to home country conduct-of-business rules alone .
<en> The definition of professional investor put forward by the Commission on the basis of a consensus reached between national supervisors and FESCO represents a useful starting point .
<en> Before mentioning some elements which are specific to the report prepared by Mr Katiforis , perhaps I could mention a few aspects which are common to both reports .
<en> The forthcoming revision of the ISD provides an opportunity to clarify the conditions under which firms and investors engage in cross-border business .
<en> The Commission is convinced that the approach advocated by both reports is the only one consistent with a single market .
<en> Furthermore , it will ensure that both on-line and off-line provision of investment services will benefit equally from the country-of-origin principle of the e-commerce directive .
<en> The challenge is to reach this goal in a manner which offers sufficient safeguards to the retail investor .
<en> The ISD communication suggests that this requires some further convergence of conduct-of-business and advertising rules for retail investors .
<en> The Commission is hopeful that such convergence can be achieved within a relatively short time-frame .
<en> I now come to a few points which are specific to the report prepared by Mr Katiforis .
<en> The Commission believes that inter-exchange competition and the emergence of infrastructures for cross-border trading of securities raise important new regulatory issues .
<en> These are not adequately addressed by the current ISD .
<en> The Katiforis report cautions against sweeping changes at this time .
<en> The Commission is acutely aware of the need to do no harm and of the risks of acting at a time when markets are in a state of flux .
<en> However , profound changes in the organisation of the trading infrastructure and increased involvement of household investors in equities investment call for fresh thinking .
<en> The Commission agrees with the Katiforis report that clarification of ISD provisions relating to exchanges and trading systems should concentrate on the risk to market integrity .
<en> The Commission also agrees that the primary focus of attention should be equity markets where retail investors are more exposed .
<en> Mr Katiforis , in his speech , said that he wanted a Commission proposal concerning the integrity of markets as soon as possible .
<en> As he may or may not know , the Commission is in the last stages of preparing a proposal on market abuse .
<en> That will hopefully be made known in a few weeks time .
<en> A strengthened ISD will not in itself prevent the sizeable market corrections that we have witnessed in recent weeks .
<en> However , a revised ISD can help to contain market excesses by promoting transparency , protecting integrity and ensuring that investment firms always act in the best interests of their clients .
<en> Moreover , it can ensure that these protections are enjoyed by investors throughout the European Union , regardless of the origin of the security which they are purchasing or the exchange on which that transaction is executed .
<en> Without such a framework , the Lisbon objective of a single integrated capital market , which we all want and need , will remain a dead letter .
<en> I shall now provide a more specific reply to two points raised : the first being criticism of the agreement reached within FESCO on the definition of professional investors , and the second a reply to what Mrs Kauppi said about the link between this issue and the Lamfalussy report .
<en> On the first issue , criticism of the FESCO definition of professional investors , as yet no legal content has been given to the concept of professional investor by the European Court of Justice .
<en> The FESCO agreement represents a first informal attempt to establish a collective European view on this concept and it should be welcomed as a valuable first step towards clarifying this important operational concept .
<en> The Commission is , of course , aware of widespread concern that the FESCO agreement is overly restrictive in determining which investors qualify automatically as professionals .
<en> This deprives many large and sophisticated investors of the benefits of operating under a single , that is , home-country , light-touch supervisory regime .
<en> Nevertheless , given the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the term ' professional investor ' , the Commission believes that the wisest course of action is to make use of an approach which has won support from all national securities authorities .
<en> The proposed approach to the definition of professional investor , as set out in both reports , would seem to offer additional advantages from the perspective of a properly functioning single passport .
<en> The Commission will study these proposals carefully when preparing the revision of the ISD .
<en> Finally , on the matter of the interface between this proposal and the well-known Lamfalussy blueprints , the Commission notes the observation made by Mrs Kauppi in her explanatory statement that the revised ISD is - I quote - " a prime candidate to be adopted and implemented according to any new approach which may be agreed in the light of the Lamfalussy reports " .
<en> The Commission agrees with that view .
<en> The ISD communication clearly states that the lack of capacity to issue legally binding guidance on implementation of ISD provisions has been one of the principal factors contributing to the shortfalls and uneven implementation which have bedevilled the ISD .
<en> In view of its increased scope and complexity , a revised ISD is likely to suffer even more from such defects : hence the importance of the Lamfalussy report for this issue as for a number of other ones .
<en> In conclusion , may I once again thank both rapporteurs for the important work they have been doing .
<en> May I also thank other Members of this Parliament who have intervened , in particular Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Karas .
<en> The Commission would like to assure Parliament that it will act accordingly .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Commissioner .
<en> The joint debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) In order to give real practical shape to the economic and social cohesion that has been announced , it is necessary not only to promote genuine convergence among the economically less developed Member States - the cohesion countries - but also to help reduce regional disparities , so encouraging the harmonious development of the territory of each Member State .
<en> With this in view , it is now crucial - partly by increasing the financial resources allocated to cohesion policy - to support the disadvantaged regions and those with structural problems , so helping eliminate those obstacles to regional development that exist due to the permanent natural and geographical disadvantages that exist in , for example , the island regions .
<en> Despite recognising the structural disadvantages from which islands suffer , the strategy adopted has been inconsistent , and that is why we approve of certain proposals emphasised in this report , such as an increase in the Community cofinancing rate on the basis of existing eligibility criteria , or flexibility in authorising State aids to the regions concerned , so as to alleviate the costs of fuel , transport and energy in a way that discriminates positively in favour of these regions .
<en> Recognition of the obstacles , which have already been more than adequately highlighted , is not the main issue here .
<en> Nor is the disadvantaged regions ' competition over priorities .
<en> Rather , it is the inadequacy of the financial resources allocated to cohesion policy , as shown in the current financial framework 2007-2013 , within which the Structural Funds were reduced from 0.41 % to 0.37 % of GNI and priority was given to the liberalising and privatising objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , which undermine the specific competitive advantages of these regions .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on the basis of Article 158 of the Treaty and of the Declaration on island regions annexed to it , the European Union takes into account the handicaps and constraints suffered by these regions in adopting specific measures to encourage the integration of European islands within the internal market .
<en> However , Mr Musotto , whom I thank for supporting my amendments in the Committee on Regional Development , has good grounds today for questioning the European Commission about the actual implementation of these provisions .
<en> First , I should like to remind you that the concepts of ultraperipherality and of insularity are completely separate , whatever the ties of proximity or of solidarity that unite them , since the main characteristics of the outermost regions are their great distance from the European continent and their belonging to a geographical area that is composed , for the most part , of ACP countries .
<en> Insularity constitutes both a geographical and cultural advantage that represents a potential to be developed within an appropriate development strategy and a permanent handicap that causes extra difficulty for the competitiveness of these regions .
<en> The principle of territorial cohesion , which was strengthened in the Structural Funds Regulations for 2007-2013 , must aim at the polycentric integration of European Union territory so as to give all regions and their people equal opportunities .
<en> In addition to the measures that you have mentioned , Commissioner , I would ask the Commission to further integrate the possibility afforded by the Treaty in terms of adjusting Community policies that could have negative repercussions for the economic and social development of these regions , in order to solve in practice the problems that specifically affect every island region or group of regions .
<en> In conclusion , I think we should congratulate ourselves for holding this debate at a reasonable time and not at 11 p.m. , as is too often the case , Mr President .
<sp>
<en> I am delighted , too , because I have always thought that this matter is important and deserves to be tackled by the European Union , including in the Treaties .
<en> In the past , I have attached great importance to it .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , each enlargement of the EU involves a systematic increase of the role of islands in all Community policies , from territorial cohesion through to tourism and culture .
<en> Unfortunately , the Union 's policy so far has not taken into account these specific constraints of islands , and the problems they face when trying to compete with mainland regions .
<en> There is therefore an urgent need to establish statistical indicators to help identify the specificities of all areas with difficult geographical conditions .
<en> It is also necessary to take account of the need of islands to enjoy access to the single market on equal terms with mainland regions , with priority given to the improving transport links with islands .
<en> Each Commission should examine the possibility of granting aid also to island regions where fuel and energy costs clearly adversely affect their competitiveness .
<en> Another priority is the energy security of islands and the development and implementation of relevant projects using renewable energy sources and new technologies .
<en> In addition , the Commission should examine the impact of climate change on island regions .
<en> Recognising the efforts made by the FRONTEX Agency it is nonetheless appropriate to highlight the need to monitor the impact of illegal immigration on island communities on an ongoing basis .
<en> Member States must not overlook the need to provide effective measures to preserve the unique characteristics of island regions in terms of protection of the environment and cultural heritage and promotion of the sustainable development of tourism , which also affects the growth of other important sectors such as trade , fishery , and agriculture .
<en> Finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very well-prepared document .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that it is useful to discuss a specific economic instrument to support islands , their special features and characteristics , and I believe that it is useful for cohesion policy to pay special attention to the outermost regions .
<en> I believe that we must act to bring about a real improvement in the transport system and infrastructure , external and internal connections and also connections within the islands , for instance between the coasts and the interior , but that we should avoid wasting European resources on monumental , useless projects , often designed to connect islands with the mainland via enormous bridges , which would certainly mar the very idea of island status .
<en> While I welcome the drawing up of Mr Musotto 's report , I think that it places undue emphasis on describing a relationship between islands and illegal immigration .
<en> There is no relationship .
<en> The vast majority of migrants to the Canaries arrive by plane , not by sea , just as the vast majority of irregular immigrants to Italy do not disembark at Lampedusa but also arrive by plane .
<en> In my opinion , therefore , this argument is misplaced , and for that reason I believe that this aspect is probably not integral to Mr Musotto 's report .
<en> We must also question whether the mobilisation of rapid intervention brigades on the borders may perhaps be more useful in preventing the deaths of emigrants in the Mediterranean rather than in stopping them from arriving .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to thank the Members who have played their part in this report 's coming into being .
<en> In committee , we agreed on 19 compromise amendments .
<en> The majority in committee was a clear one , of 35 to 3 , and I hope for a similar confirmation from the plenary .
<en> - Before the vote on Amendment 26 :
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would just like to point out that a mistake has been made which we would like to correct .
<en> It is in paragraph 2a .
<en> It starts ' Regrets the agreement reached on the financial framework 2007-2013 , in particular the reductions in the structural funds from 0.47 % ' .
<en> It should be ' 0.41 % ' .
<en> ( The oral amendment was accepted )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) When a few years ago voluntary organisations in my country launched a campaign against violence under the slogan ' Every Fifth Woman ' , some sections of the political elite as well as the public were outraged .
<en> They said that what might be true of Austria was definitely not true of Slovakia .
<en> At that time there was no data on violence available in Slovakia .
<en> The most recent surveys indicate that the situation is much worse , with approximately 40 % of pupils claiming that they had witnessed or had even been victims of violence .
<en> Arguably , my country is no better or worse in that respect than the neighbouring countries .
<en> Violence is a particularly grave social problem , as evidenced by the dialogue held with a thousand children and young people in preparing a strategy for children 's rights .
<en> One of the first priorities formulated during the exercise referred to violence experienced by children .
<en> In this respect I welcome the report by Mrs Gröner , who has promoted it with extraordinary commitment .
<en> I am extremely pleased that this programme has been so successful and that it is now better funded .
<en> However , it is imperative to establish a better legislative framework to underpin the struggle against violence .
<en> The report on trafficking in human beings underlines the importance of cooperation and , to a certain extent , harmonisation of European and national laws .
<en> I think this is indeed essential in this case , too , and I greatly appreciate Mr Frattini 's efforts on this front .
<en> I would like to highlight the positive and irreplaceable role of voluntary organisations in this area .
<en> In this respect I would also welcome moves to facilitate access to funding for voluntary organisations .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , violence against women is a scourge which no democratic society can tolerate .
<en> Eradicating gender violence is therefore crucial if we are to achieve a society in which there is genuine democracy , justice and solidarity .
<en> Hence the importance of this report .
<en> I would therefore like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work .
<en> The Daphne programme is an essential instrument for supporting women 's organisations that are fighting gender violence , and its separation from the prevention and information programme in the field of drugs has strengthened it and made it more visible .
<en> It has been a genuine success for this Parliament , as have the increase in its budget , the inclusion of people trafficking and forced prostitution as forms of violence and the reference to genital mutilation and honour crimes .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , my country , Spain , has a pioneering law for tackling gender violence from all perspectives .
<en> We believe it to be a necessary tool in order to put an end to these crimes within a reasonable space of time .
<en> For all of these reasons , I believe it to be extremely important to draw up a European legal framework as soon as possible for combating violence against women in an integrated manner in all Member States .
<en> I agree with Mrs Gröner that we must make urgent progress in that direction .
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) I want to thank Mrs Gröner and Commissioner Frattini for their excellent work .
<en> In the Committee on Civil liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , I was responsible for sending this report back to the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , where it belongs .
<en> Daphne is an issue dear to the heart of Swedish Social Democrats because it was Swedish Commissioner Mrs Gradin who made such a vigorous commitment to the EU 's role in combating violence against women .
<en> As long as men perpetrate violence against women and children , as long as the sex slave trade involving women and young girls exists , as long as not all women in the EU are entitled to free abortion , as long as women in the EU are affected by honour crimes involving violence and as long as women 's rights in the EU need to be strengthened , we Social Democratic women will continue to fight for Daphne and for proper financial support for the programme .
<en> I regret the fact that we did not obtain support for setting up a network of children 's ombudsmen but , on that issue , I shall get back to Commissioner Frattini and others when we take a decision on the strategy for children .
<en> What is so fantastic about Daphne is that it is the organisations ' ability to try out new ideas and to take inspiration from examples of good practice that we can make use of in the fight against violence throughout the EU .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the Daphne programme was set up in 1997 and has already helped to fund over 370 projects supporting non-governmental organisations , institutions and associations working to prevent and combat violence against children , young people and women .
<en> A budget amounting to approximately EUR 117 million is planned for Daphne III .
<en> We must welcome the fact that the Council decided to accept most of Parliament 's amendments from first reading , notably those aimed at reducing bureaucracy and providing technical aid for proposals .
<en> It is partly due to Parliament that the very effective special hotline for victims of violence will be able to continue operating .
<en> In addition , a team of experts providing support and advice for victims is to be set up .
<en> The aims of Daphne III are worthy of particular support .
<en> They include support for a common policy on public health protection , combating domestic violence , protecting children 's rights and combating human trafficking .
<en> In this connection , the European Commission must , as soon as possible , consider the proposal by Parliament and by the Council concerning the possibility of an initiative for a European year to combat violence towards children , young people and women .
<en> In conclusion , I should like to thank Mrs Gröner , the rapporteur .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Tuesday 22 May .

<2en> Violence against women within the family is a serious social problem , which is related to the structurally disadvantaged position of women and discrimination against them that unfortunately still exists in this male-dominated society .
<2en> We are talking about a humiliating and unjust phenomenon that - albeit to varying degrees - may be found in all countries and social strata , and that adversely affects women 's living conditions , daily lives and participation in the labour market .
<2en> I emphasise : violence committed by men against women is unacceptable in a modern , democratic society !
<2en> The earlier successes of the Daphne programme make it clear that the programme must be continued .
<2en> I consider it an outstanding result , as well as a significant opportunity , that the new programme has more than twice as much funding than the previous one , and thus we will expect even more from it .
<2en> Particular attention needs to be devoted , in implementing the programmes , to increasing transparency , goal-oriented approaches and effectiveness , and to making sure that they reach an ever greater segment of society .
<2en> In the struggle against this destructive phenomenon , a major role is played by raising awareness and extending social prevention to all areas .
<2en> Unfortunately , on the subject of violence against women within the family , there are still no truly reliable and revealing statistical data available that are harmonised on an EU level and thus would be sufficiently comparable .
<2en> Every possible means must be used to create the conditions for this to be done .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) I welcome the initiative whereby Parliament and the Council in a joint statement invite the Commission to consider an initiative for a European Year to combat violence against children , young people and women .
<en> I consider it a significant achievement that upon adopting a common position , the Council acknowledged the success of the DAPHNE programme , and gave its unanimous support to the continuation of the programme for a third phase , which will run until 2013 .
<en> I would like to emphasise as a further positive result that the budget has been increased to nearly 117 million euro , which in comparison to the 50 million budget for Daphne II and the 20 million for Daphne I represents a significant step forward .
<en> I think we can regard as a joint success the fact that in the negotiation process , Parliament succeeded in defending a number of its amendments , for instance facilitating access for NGOs .
<en> The fact that we have been able to ensure that the helpdesk service will continue to operate , and that a think-tank providing expert advice will be set up , is a significant achievement .
<en> I see my own efforts and initiatives reflected in the fact that an agreement was reached regarding the preparation of a joint statement on the European Year to combat violence against children , young people and women .
<en> Finally , as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament 's spokesperson for Roma affairs , I wish to draw attention to the fact that within the Roma minority , which is itself so often defenceless , the most vulnerable members , namely children and women , face multiple disadvantages .
<en> They are the most vulnerable to violence , and therefore I urge special emphasis for their support and protection within the framework of this programme .

<en> The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the fifth session of the UN Human Rights Council which will take place in Geneva on 11-19 June 2007 .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , ladies and gentlemen , from the very outset the European Union welcomed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006 but has always emphasised that it expects the Council to be an efficient and credible body making a genuine contribution to the global protection and promotion of human rights .
<2en> At the previous sessions of the Human Rights Council , the European Union has also attached importance to substantive debates on human-rights issues as well as to dialogue and close cooperation .
<2en> During the fourth regular session , the European Union and the African Group succeeded in securing the adoption by consensus of their resolution on Darfur .
<2en> This was the result of sustained efforts on the part of the European Union , and the outcome reflects not only the mandate of the Council but also the level of responsibility it should be expected to exercise .
<2en> The capacity of the Human Rights Council to fulfil its mandate is inextricably linked to its composition .
<2en> Allow me to recall once more that the General Assembly of the United Nations expects the member nations of the Council to observe the highest standards of human rights .
<2en> It has also called on all UN Members to elect to the Council only those nations with good human-rights records .
<2en> Although this ideal is still far from having been achieved , I should like to express the satisfaction of the European Union that the election of Belarus to the Human Rights Council was successfully thwarted in May .
<2en> This success was due in no small part to the opposition of the European Union to the candidature of Belarus .
<2en> Although it is in a minority in numerical terms , the European Union nevertheless plays a leading role in the Council and has established itself as a major player .
<2en> In spite of some encouraging developments , such as the adoption of an International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance , more action is needed to equip the Human Rights Council with the working practices and instruments it needs to live up to the expectations of the international community and particularly those of the European Union .
<2en> The European Union attaches top priority to the institutional establishment of the Council .
<2en> It is therefore making strenuous efforts to ensure that this institution-building process is successfully completed by the end of the first year .
<2en> The forthcoming fifth session will therefore be crucially important .
<2en> At that session the Council will take its concluding decisions on the establishment of the institution and will thereby ultimately determine its own efficiency and credibility for the next five years .
<2en> The European Union is currently cooperating closely in Geneva with all participants in order to achieve an outcome that will enable the Human Rights Council to make full use of its mandate .
<2en> In the Presidency 's contacts with the President and the other delegations of the Human Rights Council , we are trying to establish a central role within the United Nations system for an efficient and credible Council .
<2en> To this end the European Union wishes to insist on the creation of an effective and universal periodic review process and on the preservation of issue-based and country-based mandates .
<2en> The planned code of conduct for special rapporteurs must not impair their independence ; on the contrary , it must guarantee that independence and focus on the obligations of the states with which the rapporteurs cooperate .
<2en> Moreover , we are pursuing the aim of establishing a suitable process for the selection of national representatives which will ensure that they possess the requisite expertise as well as guaranteeing their independence .
<2en> We are aware of the difficulties involved in the pursuit of these objectives .
<2en> Let me assure you that we will not relax our efforts to achieve them .
<2en> It also remains the firm hope of the European Union that the Human Rights Council , with its sessions held at regular intervals throughout the year , its new and improved set of instruments and its continuing commitment to the present dialogue with special rapporteurs and the High Commissioner for Human Rights , will develop into a cornerstone of the human-rights system of the United Nations .
<2en> It is now up to all members of the Human Rights Council to act responsibly and to work towards the achievement of these goals .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , President-in-Office Günter Gloser , ladies and gentlemen , since it was founded , the European Union , as you know , has been one of the main driving forces for the protection of human rights and has therefore played an active role in pursuing the aims of the Human Rights Council and ensuring that the new body represents a real improvement on the Commission on Human Rights .
<2en> The initial aims have therefore been to ensure that the Council sessions deal with urgent human-rights issues in the context of actual occurrences , to improve coordination within the EU and to step up the Union 's outreach efforts , in other words its attempts to sensitise non-EU governments to human-rights issues .
<2en> In these respects real progress has been made , allowing us , on the one hand , to make a coherent and credible stand in the Human Rights Council and , on the other hand , to enhance our cooperation with partners in other parts of the world through bilateral meetings as well as in multilateral forums and through a broad-based campaign to raise awareness in many of the world 's capitals .
<2en> Among the priority tasks in the course of the first year have therefore been the safeguarding of the mandates and mechanisms of the Human Rights Council in the framework of the review process and the establishment of the new system , known as the universal periodic review , for the monitoring of the human-rights situation in all countries .
<2en> The general compromise package presented only yesterday by the President of the Human Rights Council certainly points in the right direction ; while it needs improvement , from our perspective it is nevertheless a very good initial basis for negotiation .
<2en> Next week 's fifth session of the Human Rights Council therefore assumes very special importance as a key to the future of that body .
<2en> This is another reason why I am particularly pleased that a delegation from the European Parliament will be attending the session as part of the delegation from the European Communities .
<2en> What is the verdict on the performance of the Human Rights Council to date ?
<2en> It is impossible to provide a clear-cut answer , but in my view the Council should be an ongoing project , a kind of work in progress , as it were .
<2en> Let me make a few brief comments .
<2en> The first Council sessions were certainly rather disappointing .
<2en> The old behaviour patterns resurfaced .
<2en> We were already familiar with them , of course , from the Commission on Human Rights .
<2en> The sessions on the Middle East in particular were truly marred by an uncooperative attitude on the part of the very states that had convened them .
<2en> The result was unbalanced draft resolutions which we in the European Union were unable to support .
<2en> Let me therefore make it clear that , while confrontation on human-rights issues may well be necessary on occasion when people 's fundamental rights are at stake , it is a different matter when human rights are used as a cover for the pursuit of a primarily political conflict .
<2en> Just like the Council Presidency , however , we too have observed that the very good resolution on Darfur which was recently adopted there has mitigated these unfavourable impressions .
<2en> I firmly believe that it is the most important resolution the Council has adopted .
<2en> It was closely coordinated with the African Group in very protracted negotiations and was ultimately adopted by consensus .
<2en> That was a considerable achievement when we consider what a sensitive issue it addressed , coupled with the fact that the EU can now be easily outvoted in the Human Rights Council .
<2en> The monitoring body of five independent UN rapporteurs that was established by the resolution will present its first report to the Council in the next few weeks , most probably next week .
<2en> And let us not forget that the International Criminal Court recently indicted two Sudanese suspects .
<2en> In short , there is at least movement on that front in Darfur .
<2en> We very much hope that this will set an example as well as setting standards for the future work of the Human Rights Council .
<2en> Lastly , the interactive dialogues with the High Commissioner and the UN 's special rapporteur have proved to be a very useful development .
<2en> They have enabled us to approach the human-rights situation in individual countries - often in connection with more general human-rights issues - in a highly visible as well as far less confrontational manner .
<2en> Our next step , however , is to find more ways of ensuring that these dialogues can be followed by practical progress on the ground .
<2en> However impatient we may be for rapid progress in the UN Human Rights Council , I would warn anyone against snap judgments on the Council at this stage .
<2en> All we can say so far is that there have been bright and dark sides .
<2en> We are convinced that the EU will continue its efforts to build on the encouraging developments that have undoubtedly taken place and to nurture , in the framework of an intensive dialogue with its UN partners , an effective UN Human Rights Council and above all one that acts in the interests of the people concerned .
<2en> It remains the main international forum for the treatment of human rights , and we in the EU have a responsibility to make active use of it to reinforce our values , our ideals and our interests .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( LT ) First of all I would like to thank Council and Commission representatives for their reports about the first working year of the United Nations Human Rights Council and for the fifth United Nations Human Rights Council session .
<en> Tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on a resolution concerning this issue , which sets out all the basic problems , such as our aspirations for the Human Rights Council 's modus operandi , its mechanisms , special procedures , special rapporteurs , universal periodic review , and the role of the European Union .
<en> The European Parliament has undoubtedly expected and still expects a lot from the Human Rights Council for the simple reason that human rights are a matter of particular importance , since respect for human rights and their defence are a fundamental part of EU ethics and statutes , and in general they are the foundation of Europe 's unity and integrity .
<en> The United Nations Human Rights Council can provide excellent possibilities for effective action in defending and safeguarding human rights , and for promoting them on behalf of the United Nations .
<en> In this regard the fifth session is particularly important , since one year of activity of the Human Rights Council has revealed problems and shortcomings , which can and must be fixed straight away .
<en> This is necessary so that the Human Rights Council can become a truly reliable structure - able to react adequately and , when required , quickly to breaches of human rights in any country of the world , and capable of finding effective means to influence the governments of those countries where human rights are being crudely violated .
<en> The first year of activity of the Human Rights Council has permitted us to ascertain whether , in applying its planned procedures and mechanisms , the Human Rights Council will be able to implement the ambitious programme that it has adopted for itself .
<en> The first year 's experience , resolutions on Darfur , Iran and Uzbekistan , the application of confidentiality requirements when human rights abuses in the latter two countries were being discussed , as well as other decisions , have demonstrated that the procedures of the Human Rights Council must be maximally transparent , and that the special rapporteurs and experts need to be truly independent .
<en> Furthermore , it is essential to apply clear criteria when choosing members for the Human Rights Council : simple logic indicates that countries , in which there are gross violations of human rights , should not be chosen as members of the Human Rights Council .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I believe that we can be pleased with the consensus that has been achieved amongst the groups in the House in relation to the text that we are going to put to the vote tomorrow for the fifth session of the United Nations Human Rights Council .
<en> Since this Council was created , it has not had a very easy time .
<en> It is therefore important that the European Parliament should once again show consistency in terms of how to proceed with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and , specifically , how to facilitate and improve the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council .
<en> On assessing its activities , it appears that there are certain deficiencies that need to be resolved and which are based on two fundamental problems .
<en> On the one hand , the weakness and insufficiency of the responses to dramatic and urgent situations that require much more vigorous action .
<en> I am referring primarily to the dramatic situation in Darfur , something to which everybody should be paying the greatest possible attention .
<en> Secondly , the need substantially to improve the Council 's internal mechanisms and to improve the dynamics of the relationship between the member countries for the sake of more effective and ambitious work .
<en> There is a fundamental problem underlying both issues , and Parliament and the European Union can do significant work in this regard .
<en> I am referring to political differences , which must not hinder the crucial common efforts to substantially reduce the vulnerability of the world 's peoples to abuses and violations of human rights .
<en> This aspect is vital , since Europe must be at the forefront in terms of treating all countries equally when it comes to dialogue on human rights .
<en> We believe that this philosophy must be extended to the Council and that the next Romanian Presidency of the United Nations Human Rights Council can offer a good opportunity for these essential improvements to become reality .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( RO ) Mr President , we cannot but welcome an analysis of the evolution of the single market - this major target of the European project - 50 years after its beginnings .
<en> However , it is not certain that significant progress has been made ; the project is seriously delayed compared to the proposed schedule .
<en> The situation is regrettable having regard to the fact that this important instrument of solidarity including the four fundamental freedoms ( free movement of persons , goods , capitals and services ) does not consistently contribute to the achievement of the European project .
<en> Without approaching the issue of building the single market very analytically , I would like to say that the achievement of this target will face some difficulties because of at least three reasons .
<en> The existing gap between the different levels of functionality and efficiency of national markets : theoretically , all economies based on free market relations are functional ; practically speaking , market functionality is conditionned by a series of political , economic , social , cultural and , especially , historical factors that give the character of a more or less functional market ; this gap has unfavourable effects on the construction of the single market .
<en> The protectionist measures set up by certain states , especially those with a developed economy , do not allow less developed markets to advance and this abuse of economic power significantly reduces their rights to the benefits of the competition effects , which is an essential democratic element of the single market .
<en> Finally , the absence of common legal provisions , especially in the taxation field , has negative effects on the single market project , bearing in mind that heterogeneity in taxation could generate tensions between Member States .
<en> I support the report but I think that to ensure a greater degree of consistency , an analysis should have been carried out of the national markets in the States with less developed economies , especially in new Member States , such as Romania and , following the results , approximation measures to the developed economies should be put in place , as this is a sine qua non condition for the construction of the European single market .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , without any doubt the common market is the cornerstone of the competitiveness of the European Union and of consumer satisfaction .
<en> The report we are debating today states clearly , and in my opinion quite rightly , that this market , of which we can be proud , has been built on the principles of economic competition .
<en> That is why I would like to point out that the single market is now in danger .
<en> The Reform Treaty adopted under the Portuguese Presidency represents this danger .
<en> According to the mandate of the German Presidency , undistorted competition should be completely eliminated from the Union 's fundamental goals , which are always crucial in solving possible disputes .
<en> All that is left is the creation of an internal market by the Union .
<en> Economic competition thus disappears into some supplementary protocol that completely lacks the force of the Reform Treaty .
<en> Once the Treaty is adopted , defending the principles of undistorted competition within the Union will be even more difficult than it is today .
<en> This will not enhance either the Union 's competitiveness or consumer satisfaction .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , the first thing I must do is to thank the rapporteur , Jacques Toubon , who was also responsible for working out our own position in the EPP-ED Group , in close cooperation with representatives of Member States in northern , southern , eastern and western Europe .
<en> We had a good exchange of views and we are agreed that the positive aspects of the internal market extend well beyond what is in the realm of general public knowledge , and also beyond what has been recognised in certain debates here in Parliament .
<en> We are also agreed that the Commission and its public relations services will have a major role to play in making working people more aware of the market 's inherent advantages .
<en> In my view , in the light of the merger between Suez and Gaz de France , the Internal Market Test - which is proposed in this report and which we in the EPP-ED Group support - could very usefully be transposed into national legislation .
<en> It would also be entirely reasonable to ask whether mergers such as this , or other developments at Member State level , might not usefully be subject to a similar test , in order to check their impact on the internal market and to explore whether or not , within that market , they bring advantages for ordinary people .
<en> We also inserted into the report a passage on services of general interest , which undoubtedly now makes sense in the light of the new legal basis created by the Reform Treaty , as already mentioned .
<en> We are agreed , too , that the internal market is Europe 's key asset in the process of globalisation .
<en> Only a properly functioning internal market can afford protection against certain developments in international markets .
<en> For we cannot rely solely on monitoring systems , Ms Rühle , relevant though they may have been in relation to some toy manufacturers ' recalls : we also need to appeal to the pride and the characteristic quality of our own European manufacturers because we shall never be capable of monitoring everything .
<en> We are keen to see what the Commission will propose in response to this report , in the Single Market Review this autumn , and we hope we shall be in a position to take further decisions about the right course for the internal market on the basis of the report which the Commission adopts at that stage .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , on behalf of the Social Democratic Group , I too would like to thank Mr Toubon for a report which , overall , we can support because it contains a great many positive aspects of particular importance to the members of our Group .
<en> That is as it should be , for what we are talking about here is the future of the internal market ; we are talking about answering the questions that people who live in the European Union are asking ; and we are talking about confidence in European Union policies .
<en> To Ms Riis-Jørgensen , I would say this : it is not good enough to read only those passages of the report that give one particular personal satisfaction ; the text needs to be considered in its entirety .
<en> Nowhere does it say that free competition , the internal market and deregulation are the only priorities .
<en> Quite the opposite , in fact , for a great many social democratic aspects have been included .
<en> To take one example , in paragraph 8 we have spelled out the importance of impact assessment , which is particularly relevant in terms of social rights and labour law .
<en> That is the key to achieving the much repeated aim of ensuring that people come before the economy , and not the other way round - and that has to be the priority in any policy in which we invest our efforts .
<en> Another aspect of this report that is very positive for us as Social Democrats is the move to extend the scope of harmonisation , as opposed to simple mutual recognition .
<en> Mutual recognition in itself is not bad , but harmonisation is better .
<en> In effect , we have come up with a response which not only offers an effective form of protection , at a high level , for members of the public , but also makes it clear that we cannot have a scenario of competition between Member States ' social systems ; what we want is cooperation between the different social systems , based on the highest possible values .
<en> This is an extremely important point and we have done very well to get it across .
<en> Another particularly important achievement for us as Social Democrats was the last-minute agreement on services of general interest .
<en> I welcome the fact that the European People 's Party has moved forward on the basis of the text currently in preparation for the Treaty on European Union .
<en> It is right that defending services of general interest should be one of our priorities and that we should address the legal uncertainties currently facing such services in the European Union , with a view to protecting the public and meeting demand in this area .
<en> There is one point , however , on which we as Social Democrats must withhold our approval , and that is the ' Internal Market Test ' .
<en> Nowhere in the text , Mr Schwab , is there a stipulation on this Internal Market Test , and I would suggest that you need to read the text more closely .
<en> For us as Social Democrats , an Internal Market Test is not a yardstick that we want to apply - or at least not until similar emphasis is placed on other tests such as gender mainstreaming or social impact , which follow from the Treaties .
<en> Until tests like these , which are required by the European Union Treaties , are routinely conducted , we cannot give our approval to a test that is not even provided for in the Treaties .
<en> This is another point on which our position has to be very clear .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , the internal market is certainly working if we measure it in terms of overall economic growth .
<en> It is certainly working , too , if we just accept the fact that what we have been experiencing - since we have had an internal market in Europe - is the greatest redistribution of wealth that this continent has seen in peace time .
<en> Yet in terms of people 's acceptance of it , the internal market is certainly not working .
<en> Why not ?
<en> Precisely because we have this huge range of wealth levels , because unearned income is growing far faster than wage packets - and that is why , 15 years after Jacques Toubon , this report will come to be seen as a powerful testament to the failure of the Socialists and Social Democrats .
<en> If you read the draft amendments to this report , you will find no surprises .
<en> There are calls for effective regulatory mechanisms , for a review of internal market strategy , for initiatives to reinforce the social agenda and for a social safeguard clause .
<en> The Social Democrats were in the overwhelming majority in Europe for such a very long time , and 15 years down the line we will find out that they accomplished nothing and that they are responsible for increased radicalisation on the political fringes in Europe .

<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the fact that , as part of the reform of the sugar market , sugar supply has fallen by 0.2 million tonnes in the last two years , an amount that differs considerably from the proposed level , should come as no surprise to anyone .
<en> This outcome was foreseen by Polish MEPs , as witnessed by our speeches both before the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in the plenary of the European Parliament .
<en> The failure to achieve the intended aims indicates that adequate motivation and incentives , including opportunities for beet growers to take up other production , were not put in place .
<en> This was acknowledged by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when they proposed , among other things , raising the amount of aid set aside for growers and entities providing services from 10 % to 50 % of the aid allocated to a sugar factory business , and raising the extra payment for growers for the marketing year 2008-2009 from EUR 237.50 to EUR 260 per tonne of the quota which was being renounced .
<en> It also needs pointing out that the Commission is currently not implementing the principles of the reform , the aim of which is to maintain production in the most competitive regions .
<en> The proposed changes do nothing to counter the problems , let alone resolve them ; they are making the situation worse .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , thank you very much to the Commissioner for being here .
<en> I think that the Commissioner , the rapporteur and many of the speakers have highlighted the problems that there have been with implementing the 2005 sugar reform , and the fact that abandonment of production has suffered delays leaving it far short of the objective of 6 million tonnes provided for in the reform .
<en> I therefore believe that we all welcome the proposal that the Commission is now putting forward , which will give a new impetus to abandonment .
<en> The sector , too , mainly the beet production sector , is very pleased that the restructuring process is being speeded up given that , as the Commissioner also said , otherwise there will be an across-the-board cut in quotas in 2010 , with no aid funds to compensate for those cuts .
<en> I think that the amendment I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is in line with this philosophy and this new proposal .
<en> I am referring to Amendment 31 , which calls for a report evaluating the reform and , if necessary , proposals to extend this aid fund by one year during the 2010-2011 marketing year .
<en> It was initially planned for a period of four years , to compensate , as I said , for this initial delay in implementing the reform .
<en> This is something that has been called for by producers , and I think that it should be supported , especially given that the fund is financed solely by the sector , and therefore has no financial impact on the Community budget .
<en> I ask , Commissioner , for this amendment to be approved by the Commission , and of course also my fellow Members .
<en> Finally , I would just like to thank Mrs Batzelli for her work , her reports , and the improvements she has proposed , with the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture , and for the proposal presented by the Commission .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that far-reaching reforms are needed in the sugar industry in the European Union to enable it to remain successful in the future .
<en> Reducing production is an essential component of these reforms .
<en> However , this reduction should focus primarily on companies that are uncompetitive ; unfortunately , the reality is often different .
<en> For example , in my home country , the Czech Republic , the sugar factories that were new , effective and prosperous were closed and quotas were renounced on behalf of supranational producers .
<en> Of course this had a very negative impact on domestic growers and consumers .
<en> I would therefore like to appeal to the Commission to take competitiveness principles into account , to a greater extent than before , when implementing the necessary reforms in the sugar industry , and to pay much more attention to the development of the biofuels sector .
<en> I think that biofuels offer new opportunities to sugar beet growers and represent the future .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , the reform of the sugar market which was begun in 2005 is not achieving the anticipated results , despite huge financial outlay .
<en> Despite large financial incentives , amounting to EUR 730 per tonne of reduction in sugar production , in the Community as a whole sugar production has fallen by barely 1.1 million tonnes , instead of the anticipated 6 million .
<en> The next set of changes to the functioning of the sugar market proposed by the Commission are not only failing to improve the situation , they are actually making it worse , as they are not consistent with the main principle of the reform , in other words sustaining sugar production in the most competitive regions .
<en> What I think is needed is , firstly , to create conditions for stable development for the most competitive sugar producers in the Community , to enable EU production to compete on an increasingly open world market .
<en> Secondly , we need to draw maximum advantage from sugar 's export potential within the framework of the limit agreed with the World Trade Organisation .
<en> And finally , thirdly , if these solutions fail to produce a marked improvement in the sugar market , it will be necessary to reduce production , but using a linear factor that is the same for all Member States .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Madam President , I represent a country that invented the sugar cube .
<en> High-quality sugar was something we used to be proud of but the European Union ruthlessly took this pride away from us .
<en> If Regulation ( EC ) No 320 / 2006 is implemented , the Czech Republic will be penalised for its appropriate behaviour towards foreign investors from the original EU countries that it has allowed to take over the sugar industry in the country .
<en> This Regulation is an inappropriate attempt to satisfy the interests of the big European sugar refining companies , while the interests of the countries that are the traditional growers and producers are being ignored .
<en> It is therefore necessary , as the amendment by Mr Fajmon and others suggests , to enable Member States to scrap provisions a ) and b ) and leave it to the individual Member States to determine how to deal with the critical situation that would arise if the quota fell by 20 % or more .
<en> Otherwise , the Czech Republic might , absurdly , become an importer of the traditional product it has been making for centuries .
<en> One day , when our grandchildren are making a list of reasons why the Czech Republic should leave the European Union , the sugar policy and the regulations we are now debating will be at the top of the list .
<chp>

<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The European Union is now at a real crossroads in terms of its competitive capacity with regard to the rest of the world .
<en> Despite enjoying many attraction factors , whether historic and cultural or economic and tourist-related , we cannot escape the major challenges of global competition with the new emerging Asian economies .
<en> Our capacity to be an attractive environment for knowledge and innovation is under question .
<en> I believe that the vote on the European Institute of Technology marked an important step in the construction of a framework of European actions to help our economy grow and develop , based on the triangle of innovation , research and education .
<en> I believe that it should not be low wages or cheap labour that make the EU attractive to investment and the growth of our companies .
<en> The future is companies which understand that they need to invest in making the population highly skilled , by helping society to interact with industry and companies in order to develop high-quality and highly innovative responses to the dynamic and demanding needs of the markets .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) When the European Commission proposed establishing a European Institute of Technology ( EIT ) the idea was to create a new centre of excellence for higher education , research and innovation .
<en> This ambition is now being thwarted by the difficult question of funding and no satisfactory or permanent answer has yet been found to this problem .
<en> This is extremely worrying because it diminishes the credibility of the EIT even before it has been established .
<en> The idea of the EIT issuing an EIT mark could help solve the problem of visibility from which European research has been suffering , while at the same time providing real recognition for projects whose excellence and quality has merited such a label .
<en> It appears to me that such a flexible system , which lends itself well to the diversity that exists within Europe , would stimulate healthy competition between universities and between research projects .
<en> Another imperative , I believe , is to involve the private sector in the EIT project .
<en> The role played by public authorities should be restricted to promoting and structuring the various instruments that are required .
<en> All the rest should come from the private sector , namely the funding , organisation and management of the EIT .
<en> Above all I do not want to see the EIT become just another in a long list of EU agencies .
<en> In spite of these reservations , however , I support the report in order that the EIT may have a chance to succeed .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The EPLP have chosen to abstain on both the Amended Proposal and Legislative Resolution for the Report : European Institute of Technology .
<en> While in favour of the general objectives of the proposal and its focus on innovation , EU and Member States money would be better spent on existing Universities and EU research framework programmes .
<en> We believe that the EIT administrative structure should be as least bureaucratic as possible , and therefore smaller than the proposed 21 appointed members .
<en> There are also still serious concerns regarding the private and public financing of the EIT .
<en> Given that the Commission 's proposal to finance the EIT suggests the reopening of the financial perspectives , we cannot support the report .
<sp>
<en> - ( NL ) Mr President , I would like to take a moment to explain why I voted against the Duff report , although the Duff report is not really a controversial report as such .
<en> It is because I am opposed to the European federal philosophy that underpins the report .
<en> In short , I am opposed to a European federal state and so I am also automatically opposed to EU citizenship , and this right to vote and right to stand as a candidate for election for EU citizens in Member States other than their own is an integral part of that .
<en> I believe that the Union must remain a community of national democracies , where the right to vote and the right to stand for election , whatever type of election , must continue to be reserved for the citizens of the states concerned .
<en> It is actually a mark of the evolution of the European Union that EU citizenship is systematically confirmed and expanded , including now making the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union binding .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , we have today voted on and adopted Mr Duff 's report on the exercise of the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the Union residing in a Member State of which they are not nationals .
<en> I cannot support this report , because contrary to the intentions of the rapporteurs in my view , this method of voting and standing in elections to the European Parliament will not promote good neighbourly relations between countries , especially if they share a border .
<en> Over many years , countries with significant national minorities have developed standards for avoiding conflicts of a nationalistic nature .
<en> The voting method adopted may re-ignite such conflicts , which will run counter to the spirit of peaceful coexistence between the nations of Europe .
<en> This is because it will be possible for individuals to stand for election and vote when they are not nationals of a particular state .
<en> There are bound to be abuses of the system , for example by providing a fictional domicile simply in order to reduce the voice of a particular country , and to engineer an impact on the outcome of the elections .
<en> Checking the relevant information is difficult and expensive .
<en> In addition , this voting method will strengthen separatist movements , which is surely not what we wish for contemporary Europe .
<en> I regret that for somewhat unclear reasons , we are imposing our will on the Member States from above in this regard , thus interfering in national electoral procedures .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am satisfied with this draft resolution and with the decision that it upholds and I would also like to say something else : when man 's brutality leads to tragedy and suffering on the scale that we have seen in Darfur , then our conscience demands solidarity .
<en> I am profoundly pleased that the European Union is responding to the appeal made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations .
<en> Many Members and diplomats , including my friend and colleague Mrs Gomes just now , have stressed that this operation must under no circumstances be allowed to look like an opportunity to support French interests or to extend France 's military presence in the region .
<en> I hope that I am surprising no one when I too give my vigorous support to this view .
<en> Speaking as a former Prime Minister , may I say with some conviction that if France is still present in this region it is simply because of her significant historical heritage , where the burden of colonialism has been such that a policy of solidarity with the people is needed to try to help them regain peace and stability and to herald the start of effective governance .
<en> France no longer has any strategic or economic interests in these regions and I am one of those who would have preferred to see us withdraw a long time ago : that would have saved a lot of money and would really have been in our own interest .
<en> Even the uranium resources of the Niger do not constitute a strategic interest of kingly proportions , but simply require sufficient peace and stability so that these deposits can be made accessible to everyone and a competitive market can be established .
<en> This then is essentially a European peacekeeping operation , not a French one , and that is the way it should be .
<en> I would add a word of warning , however : this vision will only be made reality if a large number of European Member States agree to send troops .
<en> It would be damaging if the spirit of solidarity , which for historical reasons has placed greater demands on France than on others to the extent that we have the largest contingent , were to be turned by your absence into a climate of post-colonial suspicion .
<en> That would be senseless and I would take great exception to it .
<en> Let me end with the following remark .
<en> The oral amendment tabled this morning by our fellow Member Mr Gahler is for once - sadly for him - not relevant .
<en> The Republic of Chad , by way of its Foreign Minister , gave its agreement in principle to this operation in a written communication that was sent to the Security Council several days ago .
<en> I have a photocopy of this document here and I will be happy to make it available to Mr Gahler .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I too support the decision to send 4 000 EU troops to Chad in the form of a peacekeeping force .
<en> The reality is that there is a wholesale political instability in Chad and in the Central African Republic .
<en> We know that genocide is taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan .
<en> If peacekeepers are not sent to Chad , we run the risk of an even greater level of instability and violence breaking out in this region of Africa .
<en> It is estimated that there are as many as 400 000 refugees from the Central African Republic and from Darfur in refugee camps in Chad , but there are only 250 guards from the army of Chad manning these camps .
<en> Refugee camps in Chad are an enormous humanitarian crisis and the international community , including the European Union , must help the Government of Chad to deal with what is an escalating and growing problem .
<en> The stories that we hear from people who have visited the area recently are really awful and , as I said , we have to do what we can to try and relieve the human misery that is going on there at the moment .
<en> I very much support the decision to deploy 26 000 UN peacekeepers in Sudan .
<en> The European Union must be at the forefront in participating in this peacekeeping force .
<en> I also welcome the decision taken by my own Government today to carry out an immediate and in-depth assessment of the future role that Irish peacekeepers could play in the UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Sudan , the Central African Republic and Chad .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , the situation in Chad and the Central African Republic is difficult for the people affected , and I therefore support , in principle , engagement by the EU to stabilise the situation and improve the real conditions of life for the people concerned .
<en> In his statement of 27 August the President of the UN Security Council described the international community 's intentions to deploy an EU operation for 12 months with the goal of bridging the time gap until the deployment of a UN-led mission .
<en> That is why the EU has also clearly limited the operation to a period of one year .
<en> I am convinced that we need a robust mandate here ; that means not limiting ourselves purely to self-defence , but being able to pursue our objectives , if necessary , in the face of opposition from those who wish to stop us doing so .
<en> The text of yesterday 's Security Council resolution points in this direction : it refers to a ' multidimensional presence intended to help create the security conditions conducive to a voluntary , secure and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons ' .
<en> We are authorised ' to take all necessary measures ' .
<en> I urge the Council to ensure that this force is not simply a cosmetically enhanced French force .
<en> In terms of the nationality of the commander , too , local sensitivities should be respected .
<en> Unfortunately , France has not been neutral so far in the conflicts in Chad and the Central African Republic , but has traditionally supported the government .
<en> For that reason , the language chosen for the command and operation at local level should be English , so that the people at least understand that these Europeans are obviously different from the ones they are accustomed to seeing .
<en> Indeed , while I am on the subject of Britain , the UK has prevented the EU 's Command Headquarters in Brussels from leading the operation , and in my view , this warrants considerable criticism .
<en> Not participating yourself but denying others the use of joint structures : that is something that we should not accept from those who drop out in future !
<en> As regards the achievability of the goals , I still have doubts .
<en> Have we set ourselves clear objectives ?
<en> How many of the internally displaced persons should be back home by the end of the year ?
<en> How many refugees from Darfur should have returned to Darfur ?
<en> We would not have achieved enough if we handed on the baton after a year with the same number of people still in the camps .
<en> The costs are also considerable : I hear that it will cost EUR 100 million just to build a suitable runway and headquarters .
<en> Then there are the ongoing costs of the troops .
<en> Can the Council give us any specific details of the overall financial framework ?
<en> I have one final , but to my mind crucial , point : before deploying the force we must have an explicit assurance from the Government of Chad that it will subsequently endorse the deployment of a UN-led force , whatever the composition may be .
<en> I have heard what our colleague has said .
<en> I would like to have that confirmed in writing , in the form of an official document from the Government of Chad , not verbally from the Minister in the UN Security Council .
<en> When I have this assurance , I can vote for the project .
<en> Otherwise , we really will face the alternative , after a year , of either having to extend the operation or withdrawing and leaving a military vacuum in which an identical situation to the present one could very quickly arise .
<en> In that event , we would literally have allowed hundreds of millions to run into the sand .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am delighted that we are today able to discuss and vote for a resolution on an issue that in my view does not get enough attention , for the situation facing the border communities of Sudan , Chad and the Central African Republic is quite simply intolerable and it is something that must never be forgotten in this House .
<en> I for my part do not forget and I have no intention of passing over in silence the fact that this whole affair is one of the many consequences of the Darfur genocide , an event that has been masquerading as something else .
<en> Since 2003 the Darfur crisis has created two and a half million refugees , including 125 000 in Chad .
<en> There have also been several hundreds of thousands of deaths .
<en> Moreover , to date the humanitarian agencies of the United Nations and the NGOs have had to move their camps 31 times in order to escape the violence , though this has not prevented the arrest of a number of their officials by the Sudanese police , the massacre of 12 humanitarian workers and the disappearance of five others .
<en> The resolution that we are tabling today is clearly intended as an effective contribution to the objective of ending the situation that exists in the border areas .
<en> This situation is unacceptable , but it is of relative magnitude when we see the scale of the disaster currently unfolding in that part of the world .
<en> In this respect , I would like to point out that our responsibilities should not be limited to supporting or heading isolated and narrowly-defined operations as an emergency reaction to conflict situations .
<en> This responsibility calls for action to be taken in the wider context to which such conflicts belong .
<en> It also requires measures to be taken ahead of events , in other words making every possible effort to ensure that such conflicts do not happen in the first place .
<en> The second part of my speech concerns the situation of the humanitarian organisations operating in the region .
<en> The manner in which methods have evolved for the intervention of armed forces and for the role played by humanitarian agencies in conflict situations has meant that the boundary separating these two parties is becoming increasingly blurred .
<en> As the confusion that exists between military and humanitarian personnel tends to act to the detriment of those missions traditionally assigned to the humanitarian agencies , we now find that the very survival of the humanitarian aid workers is being put at risk and , with it , the safety of all those people who are supposed to be benefiting from these services .
<en> It is therefore absolutely vital that our protection force is not implicated in any way in the operations being undertaken by the various humanitarian groups that are working in the region .
<en> I am pleased to see that the document before us today includes this point , which is so important for the future of our development policies both in this region and everywhere else in the world .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I strongly support the sending of an ESDP mission to the Chad / Darfur border and I welcome the opportunity today to debate this proposition .
<en> The conflict in Darfur has had dire cross-border consequences on neighbouring Chad and the Central African Republic , with a huge refugee spillover and the creation of thousands of internally displaced persons .
<en> According to high level expert advice , this mission is doable despite some considerable operational and security challenges .
<en> The infrastructure in this area is poor , water shortages subsist and logistic lines are difficult .
<en> Such a mission will also face threats from rebel groups holding out against the government , but it appears based on a thorough assessment recently carried out in this region that all these challenges are surmountable .
<en> So there is no reason to further delay deployment .
<en> We have the military capacity ; what is now required is the political will .
<en> I call for Irish troops to form part of this ESDP mission .
<en> There is a sincere sense of urgency in this crisis region of the world , and Ireland could be part of a noble European effort to stabilise this border area .
<en> Troops could be pulled from the Nordic battle groups for this operation .
<en> Like these battle groups , this present ESDP mission is also intended to be a bridging operation .
<en> Alternatively , Irish troops currently in the Lebanon could also join this mission .
<en> This force has many worthy objectives .
<en> It would improve the security situation in this region prior to further deployment of the United Nations / African Union mission in Darfur .
<en> It would also be of assistance to relief organisations as it would open up previously impeded humanitarian corridors .
<en> Thirdly , it would eventually facilitate the return of Sudanese refugees .
<en> I believe this mission should have a robust use-of-force mandate with reference to Chapter VII of the UN Charter enabling it to have a deterrent effect when necessary , especially in the case of attacks against civilians , camps , villages , humanitarian workers , UN police officers and for self-defence .
<en> The rainy season is abating .
<en> The frequency of attacks on refugee camps is likely to increase as the militia and rebel groups become more mobile now that the rains have subsided .
<en> The time for the UN to act is now .
<en> Inaction is costing lives .
<en> The EU is the most acceptable organisation to carry out this mission , and it is , based on several accounts , well-set to undertake this task .
<en> I urge the Council to adopt a joint action immediately and to set the final stages in motion so that we do not miss the boat on getting EU troops in where they are urgently required .

<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I tried very briefly in my speech to give this House detailed and comprehensive information on all the political and diplomatic measures being taken and contacts being made in relation to the Burma ( Myanmar ) issue , on how we have been monitoring the situation and on what we have done .
<en> I should now like to reaffirm the Portuguese Presidency 's absolute determination to continue monitoring closely the events developing in Burma and also to assure you that the Presidency will of course propose any measures which , in its opinion , prove our unequivocal solidarity with the people of Burma and which , at the same time , also unequivocally demonstrate to the Burmese authorities that there will be a price to pay for any further deterioration in the country 's situation .

<en> I had the privilege of visiting Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon almost a decade ago , when her house arrest was sufficiently relaxed for her to receive rare visitors .
<en> She made it absolutely clear that she , as the representative and leader of the democratically elected National League for Democracy , overthrown by the military regime , wanted the EU to impose the strongest possible sanctions .
<en> Now the EU and Member States should lead the demand for global UN sanctions through the Security Council .

<en> The junta has chosen confrontation with thousands of peaceful demonstrators .

<en> I support the unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi , U Khun Htun Oo , Ko Min Ko Naing and all other political prisoners and I support rapid democratic reforms .
<en> The European Commission should make optimum use of the emergency funds , provided for in objective 1 of the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights budget , so that sufficient support can be given to independent media , human rights activists and NGOs in Burma .
<en> Further tightening of all the existing economic sanctions also seems unavoidable .
<en> I am in favour of joining with the British and American measures and imposing strict restrictions on trading activities and financial transactions with Burma .

<en> Those demonstrating against the military regime ( including the monks ) are showing immense courage .
<en> The regime has brutally repressed previous demonstrations and shown scant regard for the welfare of its people .
<en> International pressure must be maximised on the regime , including a commitment to hold those responsible for any atrocities in the coming days responsible before the International Criminal Court .
<en> The EU must speak to China and India , who are in a better place to pressurise the regime , asking them to intervene to protect the demonstrators and help return Burma to democracy .

<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , the report on the table today demonstrates , once again , the relentless attack on Member States that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes .
<en> I do not accept that low corporation tax leads to unfair tax competition .
<en> I believe that ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the tax policy mix of a fully functioning single market .
<en> Where is the Commission 's evidence to prove that CCCTB will not hamper EU competitiveness ?
<en> Where is the proof to say that it will benefit EU competitiveness ?
<en> Why is it that countries with low tax , low unemployment and high growth are being attacked by the Commission ?
<en> I do not understand it .
<en> It is absolutely farcical for the Commission to say that setting a tax base will not eventually set a tax rate , because that is already what the larger Member States are saying .
<en> It does not stand up to any kind of scrutiny .
<en> Attempts by large Member States to giftwrap tax harmonisation in the flowery paper of CCCTB will not be accepted by Ireland or other Member States .
<en> The fact of the matter is that it is not the right of Ireland , or any other Member State , to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State .
<en> The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies ; rather , the EU 's competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies .
<en> I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition , not tax harmonisation .
<en> How is it that a country like Ireland , and other Member States , which changed radically their tax policies and became successful economies , are now under attack ?
<en> What is the attractiveness of a country like Ireland , Commissioner , if you bring in this system and eventually bring in tax harmonisation ?
<en> Because that is exactly what it is , and the only way tax will go is up .
<en> It has already been said , by people within the Commission , that they want to see a tax regime more or less in the middle of what it is at the moment , which is approximately in the low 20 % .
<en> What would be the attractiveness of Ireland or other peripheral countries ?
<en> There would be not attractiveness , just high unemployment in the long ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the report we have in front of Parliament today rightly states that tax competition in the EU has led , and continues to lead , to EU-wide economic gains by way of a dynamic corporate environment .
<en> The CCCTB could just as easily lead to a less competitive EU and should not be supported , in my view .
<en> The EU needs to be responsive to an ever-changing global economy .
<en> Modern competitive economies need to be flexible to meet the changing requirements of new products and services .
<en> The CCCTB will undermine this flexibility for a number of reasons .
<en> An EU-wide corporation tax base will be inflexible and hinder an individual country 's ability to decide its own legal fiscal strategy , based on its particular circumstances .
<en> The CCCTB 's proponents assert that each Member State will retain its autonomy to determine its national tax rate - but will they ?
<en> Is the CCCTB not the thin end of the wedge ?
<en> If the CCCTB is optional , it merely increases the number of bases available to companies and makes the system even more complex .
<en> Domestic tax law offers certainty to business .
<en> A system that is applied in a number of Member States may lead to differences over how the provisions are interpreted , bringing about uncertainty for business .
<en> In the remaining time available to me , I can simply make some bullet points .
<en> First , taxation is a matter of national sovereignty for each Member State .
<en> The right to choose the level of public spending and the funding of such expenditure is a basic function of national democratic process .
<en> It is necessary to protect the flexibility of tax policy in rewarding enterprise and the creation of jobs and growth in the economy .
<en> A single base would do away with flexibility .
<en> There is no evidence to suggest that a common consolidated corporate tax base will address issues such as competitiveness , compliance costs for companies , transfer pricing and so on .
<en> It would not simplify EU tax issues , as the so-called ' optional system ' proposed would add another layer , as I have just said .
<en> The harmonisation of the tax base would lead to pressure on national tax rates .
<en> Such harmonisation will only increase the attractiveness of non-EU corporate locations .
<en> The Code of Conduct on business taxation addressed harmful tax competition .
<en> Different tax rates in EU Member States are not harmful .
<en> I would ask the Commissioner , when he brings forward these proposals , as he suggests , next year , to please bear this in mind .
<en> Member States like Ireland have already given ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to thank our rapporteur here , for the quality of the work she has done and her efforts to come up with a text that , unfortunately , she does not seem totally satisfied with .
<en> Taxation is clearly an essential complement to the construction of a true internal market , if you want the market to be more than just a free-trade area where any form of tax and social dumping is permitted .
<en> The completion of the internal market therefore requires the harmonisation of certain rules on taxation and in the first place calls for the creation of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base .
<en> The report put before us today opens the door to this , and I am pleased about this .
<en> I note that a number of fellow Members are very actively against this plan , in the name of what they describe as ' fair ' competition .
<en> Personally I believe that free , undistorted competition - and I am not a frenzied advocate of this type of competition - requires a certain amount of transparency as regards the rules .
<en> I am surprised that countries that have benefited from massive contributions from the European Union , in the name of solidarity , are today rejecting this step , which would be an important step forward in terms of solidarity , competition and transparency .
<en> Taxation is also a formidable tool that the EU must use if it is to implement its chosen strategies , because it does not have all that many tools .
<en> It can have a positive impact on the cleanest energies or to achieve ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) Mr President , this is a report that is heavily influenced by the compromise between the PPE-DE and the ALDE .
<en> I believe it is largely a balanced report .
<en> The Member States ' responsibility for taxation policies is laid down , whilst there are a number of taxes that would benefit from greater EU coordination .
<en> In the rapporteur 's original proposal , there was thorough coordination with a strong emphasis on higher levels of redistribution .
<en> That cannot be a way to make Europe grow or to create new jobs .
<en> In the globalised world in which we live , it is not higher taxes that Europe needs .
<en> Instead , I think that we who live in high-taxation countries should look at other models , such as a flatter tax .
<en> In general , taxes should be lowered on work and raised on harmful consumption .
<en> For example , specific environmental taxes should be introduced , as well as reasonable excise duties on alcohol and tobacco , for example , as the Commissioner says .
<en> Here the EU must be able to act with greater accord .
<en> This is a politically sensitive issue - we have heard that here and I am well aware of it - but it is nonetheless necessary , in my opinion .
<en> If we are to resolve the major climate and energy challenges that we are facing , it would be irresponsible of us to rule out controlling fiscal instruments .
<en> It is possible to achieve high growth , with high environmental and energy taxes , and at the same time reduce the overall tax burden .
<en> Any doubters can look at the policy of the centre-right government in my home country , Sweden , if I can be allowed to be a little patriotic at the end of this debate .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , in taking the floor in a debate devoted to the impact of taxation and customs policies on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that some of the suggestions relating to the Member States ' tax systems that are contained in Mrs Wagenknecht 's report will not have a positive impact on economic growth and employment in EU countries .
<en> Firstly , moving away from tax competition and attempts to standardise solutions in the area of corporate income tax run counter to the principle of tax sovereignty for EU Member States .
<en> Secondly , lowering corporate tax rates while simultaneously doing away with any associated tax relief will not just fail to bring about a reduction in budget income from this tax ; it will , in fact , increase it substantially .
<en> This is confirmed by the situation in my country , Poland , where the corporate tax rate has been substantially reduced , yet receipts from this tax are greater with each year that passes .
<en> Thirdly and finally , in this situation I consider the report 's suggestions relating to coordination and tax systems , including direct taxation , to be hazardous steps that will certainly not help to implement the Lisbon Strategy .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> . - ( NL ) As a result of market forces , where the main objective is to find the cheapest rather than the cleanest electricity , we are threatened with a new upsurge of polluting fuels such as nuclear energy , coal , brown coal and oil .
<2en> In the Netherlands relatively clean power stations have been shut down to enable dirty electricity to be imported .
<2en> The replacement as soon as possible of those dirty fuels by solar , wind and hydroelectric power is indispensable for the preservation of our environment .
<2en> Instead of campaigning actively for new forms of electricity generation the individual consumer is first asked to buy cleaner energy at a different price from another supplier .
<2en> Those suppliers can now supply less clean electricity than the consumer is asking for .
<2en> This leads to attempts to include more forms of electricity generation with clean energy .
<2en> The incineration of undivided organic domestic waste and wood waste has always taken place , and is now suddenly included in the clean category so that targets can be met .
<2en> My support for the generation of clean energy does not apply to this addition .
<2en> Large-scale investment that anticipates requests from consumers and is not dependent on waste collection are an alternative to the system at present required by the Council .
<sp>
<2en> ( SV ) We Swedish Christian Democrats welcome the Directive on electricity from renewable energy sources .
<2en> We accept that the electricity gained from incinerating that part of household waste which is biodegradable should be included in the national guiding targets .
<2en> However , we would like to see incineration of unsorted household waste not being counted as electricity deriving from a renewable energy source .
<2en> Therefore , we do not accept that incineration of unsorted household waste should receive aid .
<2en> We believe that the compromise negotiated with the Council in this case is too weak .
<2en> In this regard the Council has reached a decision , but not understood its significance .
<2en> However , we believe that the importance of the directive being adopted as quickly as possible , especially in view of the vital role which the EU has and must retain during the coming climate negotiations , constitutes sufficient grounds for supporting the compromise which has been negotiated with the Council in this respect .
<2en> We therefore choose to support the compromise .
<2en> Karas report ( A5-0220 / 2001 )
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , the Karas report concerns professional pension funds .
<2en> Today , Madam President , is not 4 July 2001 : it is 4 July 2030 .
<2en> Do not worry about calculating how old we will be in 2030 ; just listen to the rest of this explanation of vote .
<2en> In 2030 , a French pensioner meets an English pensioner and says to him : ' Look what a good pension we have got !
<2en> Just think : in the year 2000 , the European citizens ' pensions were less than half the size of ours .
<2en> And how did we manage it ?
<2en> By adopting a further European directive compelling all the States to transfer all the pension funds paid to the State up until that time into professional funds , which managed the money well and thus generated good pensions ' .
<sp>
<2en> - ( FR ) The draft directive and the Karas report on pension funds and supplementary systems represent yet another attack on the existing pension schemes in the European Union .
<2en> The Karas report draws on the very liberal conclusions of the Feira European Council in approving the directive .
<2en> It takes an ' Anglo-Saxon ' approach to regulation , based on a minimum of harmonisation , as reflected in the absence of specific rules to define the commitments entered into by the pension funds .
<2en> The directive meets the demands of the UK and Netherlands pension funds , which want to be able to intervene at European level by having a single fund instead of separate funds set up in each country .
<2en> Once again , the European Union is surrendering to the dictatorship of the single market , this time in regard to retirement pensions , with the consequences we know so well : even worse inequality between workers , the stranglehold of the financial markets and shareholders on retirement savings schemes , and heavier pension fund pressure on employees .
<2en> Instead of harmonising downwards and creating a single retirement pension market , we should set up a system based on solidarity and equality at European level .
<2en> That is why we voted against the Karas report and reject the proposal for a directive .
<sp>
<2en> ( NL ) Entrepreneurs have discovered company pension funds as a source of venture capital .
<2en> Governments regard those funds as part of an integrated financial market designed to contribute to the competitive power of the European economy .
<2en> In expectation of increased returns pension capital is passed on to companies whose sole object is to make profit .
<2en> Soon the shareholders of banks and insurance companies start benefiting from profits , the retired bear the increased risk as a result of protective instruments being eliminated and the disadvantages of moving to a different employer or to another Member State are not resolved .
<2en> The proposed European regulation does not do justice to the reasons why those pension reserves were created .
<2en> Pensions are a means of redistributing and supplementing incomes , offering everyone lasting social security , even when , at the age of 70 , 90 or 110 , they are no longer productive .
<2en> An equal state pension for all of a sufficient amount is the best guarantee that no one loses the right to an income .
<2en> On the other hand company pensions are only favourable for those with permanent highly paid jobs .
<2en> They offer no solution to people who have frequently had to change jobs or employers .
<2en> That is even more true of supplementary private pensions , which are only affordable by those who are able and willing to invest surpluses in an insurance company in their productive years .
<2en> Ettl report ( A5-0211 / 2001 )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted for the Corbett report on the amendment of Rule 173 relating to the verbatim report of proceedings , even though I regret the adoption of a whole series of amendments recommending the verbatim translation of the reports into all the official languages .
<en> To those hard-line advocates of multilingualism I would say , somewhat euphemistically , that it is a fiction to claim that , without this extension to the translation process , the European Parliament would be the only parliamentary assembly in the world not to have all its proceedings and debates translated in hardcopy into all the relevant languages .
<en> This is a fiction to the extent that it has been agreed that not only will the multilingual version be retained but the simultaneous translation into all the official languages should also be made available , on request , to all the Members of the House as well as to the public at large .
<en> This is the really essential part , it seems to me .
<en> Finally , I regret that Parliament has been unwilling to adopt a more contemporary approach as far as access to the documents is concerned : I say yes , a thousand times yes to multilingualism .
<en> However , I shall continue to oppose the so-called defence of linguistic diversity when this is used as an excuse by those who support the status quo and openly oppose change .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) I voted against the proposal in the Corbett report and I did so for the same reasons that I have previously opposed the scrapping of the budget for translating the verbatim report of our sessions in this House .
<en> In a parliament , the spoken word is sacrosanct .
<en> What we say is not just an item on the day 's news if we are lucky , it is part of the democratic legislative process .
<en> Making this accessible in the official European languages is not a luxury .
<en> Translation is politically necessary for a proper archiving system which after all serves to allow open access to information .
<en> We have to bear the consequences of our fundamental decision to choose multilingualism and not let it surreptitiously crumble away .
<en> A parliament that has self-respect does not ditch its traditional archiving system .
<en> If we need to economise , we would do better to choose different areas of the budget .
<en> Anyway , I stick to my view that our insistence on multilingualism is a necessary form of respect for the diverse cultures and languages in the EU and a blessing for democracy .
<sp>

<sp>

<en> ( RO ) Today 's vote on Mr. Mantovani 's report is important due to the stimulus it gives to the European policy in the field of lifelong education .
<en> Examining the current situation in this field and its correlation with the labour market , the Mantovani report proves to us , one more time , the existence of a reality we have lived for many years , but which has not been followed by a firm and coherent policy that could cope with its challenges .
<en> Therefore , I believe it is important to implement the new proposals as soon as possible .
<en> In fact , I would like to point out the importance of recognizing and promoting education for tolerance on the entire European Union territory .
<en> This is the only way in which mobility on the labour market will not generate socially excluded groups , whose behaviour becomes deviant sooner or later .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , the European Union is not simply a common economic area .
<en> The European dimension must also be understood now in terms of intensive political and legal integration within the Union .
<en> The Union is an example of a political organisation bringing together the interests of individual Member States within the framework of a developing cosmopolitan legal system .
<en> A number of the criminal law provisions of Member States are still at an initial stage of harmonisation .
<en> Nonetheless , we should rejoice at the fact that relations between Member States are characterised by trust in each other 's legal systems .
<en> This facilitates cooperation and makes it possible for the executing State to recognise a decision taken by authorities in the issuing State .
<en> It should be noted that the humanisation of criminal law permeates through to the European legal system .
<en> The latter is of course based on the value of the fundamental entity , namely the human being .
<en> European policy should be consistent in every respect as regards handing down and enforcing sentences and the general links between convicted persons and society .
<en> Making it easier to impose alternative punishments will help to promote a humanitarian approach to criminal law and sentencing , and consequently to European law .
<en> Particular attention must be paid to the convicted person 's right and opportunity to be reintegrated into society .
<en> A wider range of alternative sentences replacing custodial sentences should be considered .
<en> It is important to bear in mind that according to international standards the status of a convicted person is the basis for assessing the extent to which the judicial system of every political community may be deemed to be civilised .
<en> Consequently , the framework decisions on enhanced cooperation in the area of criminal law presented today are worthy of support .
<en> After all , the ongoing harmonisation of criminal law provisions across the Member States is a fundamental condition for the creation of a European area of freedom , security and justice .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to focus on one aspect of what is being proposed .
<en> It is evident that the raison d 'être for this particular legislation is a humanitarian basis .
<en> If one looks at why a judgment given in one particular country can be enforced in another with regard to the criminal and penal sentences , one appreciates that , basically , what we are doing is making life for the person who has been convicted a better one : being closer , perhaps , to his family , being closer , perhaps , to his place of origin .
<en> In fact I am surprised that , whilst we are taking this legislation from a humanitarian point of view , one of the criteria that is absent when it comes to transferring a person from serving a sentence in one particular state to another is , in my view , the humanitarian aspect .
<en> We are basing the criteria , basically , on nationality , citizenship or legal permanent residence .
<en> On the other hand , we do talk about , as a proposal and counterproposal , ' close links ' , but the humanitarian aspect as a criterion in itself is absent .
<en> Let us take a particular case , for instance : it would not be possible for a person who is not a citizen of an EU country serving imprisonment in an EU country to serve closer to his homeland , because this aspect - the humanitarian criterion - has been left out .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Mr Frattini for being here again , for his commitment and for making himself available to us .
<en> You are an asset to your country .
<en> It is a shame that I cannot say the same of other Italian representatives and I do not like this .
<en> We have discussed - and are still discussing - the Schengen Agreement .
<en> Despite all the social unrest that the free movement of citizens within the EU is undoubtedly causing in Italy , Mr Amato has decided that it would be a good idea to focus on other issues .
<en> Something needs to be done to prevent this social unrest from reaching the levels witnessed in our country .
<en> However , it does not appear that anything is being done , given the rising crime rate at all levels in Italy , ranging from anti-social behaviour to organised crime , not to mention the steady inflow of illegal immigrants into our country , and above all the fact that some people who come to Italy with study , work or tourist visas are not returning to their own countries when these expire .
<en> This last point has not been widely covered by the media .
<en> Furthermore , the current Italian administration and the Minister of the Interior seem to be unaware of the crime committed in Italy largely by foreigners , some of whom are European citizens , travellers or people who call themselves this .
<en> This was highlighted a few months ago in the report by the Italian Prefect Mr Serra to the Italian Parliament .
<en> The Italian government is becoming an embarrassment to an increasingly tired nation , and they are not alone .
<en> This government , which is as incapable of understanding social unrest as it is of preventing it , cannot conceive of addressing the problem .
<en> It does not occur to it - and one wonders how it could - to admit the failings of current migration policies or the lack of application of European directives , in this case Directive 2004 / 38 / EC .
<en> On this subject , the Italian government complains of having difficulty in identifying the exact date of entry .
<en> It is clear that under the Schengen Agreement , these difficulties are growing out of all proportion .
<en> It is also obvious that my party and I would like to revoke the Schengen Agreement .
<en> Even the repeated acts of political hooliganism in Italy in recent months , suffered in many cases by my party , perpetrated by the followers of anarchic and boorish communism protected by representatives of the institutional left , are still being ignored by Mr Amato .
<en> Unfortunately , Mr Amato and President Prodi , like so many mayors , not least of all Rome 's , do not live in working-class areas , they have no contact with travellers ' camps - legal or otherwise - and they do not use public transport or experience the bullying , violence and prevarication that even EU visitors face in Italy on a regular basis .
<en> These irresponsible politicians talk about solidarity , in whose name an entire population is made to suffer their foolish decisions .
<en> The European Union , rather than lament the fact that Italy has not asked for funding , should take note of what President Barroso said , in other words that if a Member State allows slums to develop on its territory , what can it expect the Commission to do ?
<en> Mr Amato chooses to be absent from meetings on the subject .
<en> Meanwhile , Italians would like to do the only right thing : start voting and tell the government to go to hell .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) The European Union is a community of values in which respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms prevails and its policies include the security of citizens and the fight against criminality , as well as the protection of children and the fight against instigation to violence .
<en> I firmly condemn violence and offences and I deeply regret what happened in Italy !
<en> But I believe that the abuses and injustice committed in the name of the law are unacceptable , induce fear and humiliation and may instigate hatred within human communities .
<en> I have discovered a tendency to escalate this situation unjustifiably , also fueled by political and xenophobic statements uttered by certain politicians .
<en> I am worried by the fact that , according to the information published so far , only Romanian citizens have been expelled from Italy .
<en> All the Member States have the right and obligation to draw up legislative acts that would ensure and consolidate public order and safety .
<en> All the European citizens , whatever their nationality , have the obligation to comply with the law and its provisions , wherever they are on the territory of the European Union .
<en> Yet , at the same time , we have to condemn intolerance and xenophobia and , especially , the unjustified expansion of hard feelings and stigmatization from a few individuals , who are on bad terms with the law , to an entire ethnic group or , more seriously , to an entire nation .
<en> I believe the Italian State , just like all the other Member States of the European Union , has the duty to protect the rights and liberties of the European citizens residing on its territory , who integrate into the community and obey the laws .
<en> A common European approach of the policies of immigration and integration of minorities is required .
<en> The issue of minorities and , especially , of the Roma minority , is a European issue and it should be approached in a coherent and unitary manner , not only in moments of crisis .
<en> All the relevant bodies should cooperate , first of all the European Commission and the Agency for Fundamental Rights , as well as the relevant institutions in the Member States .
<en> I call upon the European Commission to review the priorities and mechanisms of the European Social Fund in order to extend the financing of common actions , which would contribute to the social inclusion of the Roma minority .
<en> At the same time , I ask the European Commission to urgently examine compliance of the decree law , issued by the Italian authorities , with the European legislation and to give assurance that the implementation of any provisions of this type shall not lead to abuses against honest people , irrespective of their nationality .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe it is right that our Parliament should send the family of Mrs Reggiani a message of condolence .
<en> I would also like to censure the recent statements by Mr Frattini , who in interviews referred to earlier confused his role as representative of the Commission with that of a member of the opposition , denying Mr Tajani this pleasure , when he would have been better to use his prestigious role to brighten the national political climate .
<en> It pains me to say it , because we have often supported Mr Frattini 's proposals and initiatives .
<en> Mr Frattini knows only too well that , as pointed out by some of my fellow Members , there is no European text that makes provision for the automatic expulsion of citizens from other Member States on economic grounds .
<en> The recent provisions of the Italian government are in line with the European directive , respecting its spirit and strengthening certain aspects considered important in light of the situation in Italy .
<en> All Italian institutions - and I say this to Mr Tajani , to Mrs Angelilli and to other members of the opposition - from the City of Rome to regional authorities , right down to the smallest local council , are committed to this .
<en> It is undignified to sling mud at the degree of civilisation and integration that our country has achieved over the years .
<en> I hope that the European Parliament will reaffirm its refusal of the principle of collective responsibility , which is used to incite hatred and violence in the heart of Europe .
<en> What we need to affirm instead is the need to combat any form of racism and xenophobia , and any discrimination based on nationality and ethnic background .
<en> We have a road map for this : the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<en> It is important that we do our best , as the Italian and Romanian Prime Ministers have asked , to ensure better social integration of disadvantaged peoples and cooperation between Member States , both in terms of managing the movements of our own migratory flows and through social development and welfare programmes financed by the Structural Funds .
<en> What we need to do in future is simple : none of us must forget that immigration is a resource , it is part of our future , but it must be governed .
<en> I therefore propose that the Member States act now to establish closer European coordination to regulate migratory movements in the European Union .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for addressing Parliament on this very important issue .
<en> There has been a lot of emotion in Italy following the murder of an Italian woman by a Romanian citizen .
<en> There has equally been a lot of emotion in Romania following reprisals against Romanian citizens by Italian gangs .
<en> However , when we put away emotions , we get back to our basic values and principles : freedom of movement for all citizens , the rule of law and its conformity with European law .
<en> Let me remind you , should it be necessary , that freedom of movement for European citizens is a fundamental right enshrined in the founding Treaties .
<en> Unfortunately , these recent events have shown us that we need to make more effort to consolidate these rights and ensure they are enforced adequately throughout Europe .
<en> In today 's Europe we cannot accept irresponsible authorities pointing fingers at specific nationalities or ethnic groups .
<en> Neither can we accept the claim that the free movement of workers might be a route to increasing criminality , because crime has neither nationality nor ethnicity .
<en> This attitude can only lead to dangerous developments and more xenophobia .
<en> On the contrary , I believe we must continue to encourage mobility of people and give workers the same opportunities all over Europe , to reinforce a strong European identity .
<en> This was the founding fathers ' genuine wish for the creation of the European Union .
<en> While I reiterate that the European Union must ensure all its citizens live in an area of freedom , security and justice , I believe we should also pay more attention to integration and freedom of movement .
<en> The answer to crime is not closing borders .
<en> The answer to crime is not encouraging xenophobia , discrimination and stigmatisation of nationalities or ethnic origins .
<en> The answer , in a modern Europe , is more police and judicial cooperation , more integration policies , more resources for those called to serve and protect all our citizens , whatever their nationality .
<en> I would like to see a Europe where all citizens can live , work and circulate freely .
<en> The European Commission , as the guardian of the Treaties , must now ensure that these basic rights are correctly implemented and enforced .
<en> I call on the Commission to stand firm on these principles .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the situation of the Roma in Europe is getting worse .
<en> The developments in Italy prove that to us .
<en> We have all seen that unchallenged xenophobic and racist hysteria can overcome common sense .
<en> The crime of one single person has fuelled an unprecedented media lynching .
<en> This moved us towards restrictions on the fundamental rights of European citizens based on popular racist and xenophobic hysteria .
<en> We must not let that happen .
<en> Criminal issues are for the judges to deal with , not for politicians or civilians .
<en> However horrible and condemnable the crime that took place in Rome is , it should not lead us to collective responsibility of a whole nation .
<en> The events in Italy did uncover the reality of the campo nomadi , in which so many Roma live .
<en> The fact that tensions and instability arise from such situations is not questionable .
<en> That is why we must act .
<en> My first assistant is a Roma .
<en> Integration can proceed quickly .
<en> In 2005 we adopted a resolution that asked for concerted EU and national action for speeding up the inclusion of Roma .
<en> Therefore , I propose that we , as MEPs , show that we care , and urge decision-makers to join us .
<en> I propose that the EP establish a permanent European Parliament rapporteur on Roma issues , who would monitor the situation of the Roma in Europe and come annually with recommendations to the Commission and governments .
<en> In addition , we should call upon the Commission to establish an EU Roma inclusion fund , together with an EU strategy for Roma inclusion and a Roma unit within the European Commission .
<en> This will ensure proper management of the EU Roma inclusion policies .

<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , congratulations to Mr Vakalis for his excellent work .
<en> This report highlights the fact that , although earthquakes can have a devastating economic and social impact in seismic-stricken regions , not enough attention has been paid to them by the EU .
<en> The rapporteur advocates - and rightly so - that a series of regulatory and financial measures are urgently needed in order to remedy this unhappy state of affairs .
<en> Such measures should aim at minimalisation of damage caused as well as facilitating speedy and effective response and compensation to affected individuals and communities .
<en> Mr Vakalis states that an area which should be given special attention is that of research .
<en> I agree .
<en> Not necessarily of course research in predicting earthquakes , a practice which has been proven to have limitations , but research in the way we construct our buildings .
<en> Attention to more stable , robust and lightweight materials is an example .
<en> Safety features to prevent electrocution and electric fires being caused after a tremor are another area where research can help prevent loss of life .
<en> Research into telecommunications systems that do not get so easily jumped in the panic that follows an earthquake and research into specialised equipment for detecting and extracting victims from collapsed buildings are other areas where research can be most helpful and very rewarding .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the motion for a resolution on the regional impact of earthquakes addresses for the first time , in a logical and coherent fashion , the issue of seismic vulnerability in parts of the Union and consequently the remit of civil protection services .
<en> I therefore say to the rapporteur : praise where praise is due !
<en> I am fascinated by , and directly involved in , this matter , living as I do in the European region at greatest risk of seismic and volcanic activity : Sicily , at the foot of Mount Etna .
<en> I had the honour of serving as the Italian Government 's commissioner for emergencies recently during a serious eruption of that volcano .
<en> I am therefore familiar with the problem at close quarters , and I also know how behind the times Italy is when it comes to risk forecasting and prevention , and not just seismic risk of course .
<en> Europe , too , lags a long way behind on this front , however .
<en> I have , for example , been calling on Parliament and the Commission for years to establish a European Civil Protection Agency responsible for coordinating the Member States ' emergency management services and drawing up a uniform policy on prevention , forecasting and training for staff and volunteers .
<en> Today 's resolution appears to go in that direction at long last .
<en> If the truth be told , the European Union as a whole still lacks a culture of civil protection , which often remains nothing more than the subject of round tables and electoral promises , even though what is at stake is the right of each and every one of us to safety .
<en> Before asking local actors , provinces , municipalities and regions for concrete examples , Europe should demonstrate that it wishes to turn the page at last , and I believe that this resolution could constitute the first proper step in that direction .

<2en> Mr President , earthquakes are inevitable , but protective shielding measures can be taken to minimise death and destruction and to allow people to enjoy greater safety .
<2en> The rapporteur proposes a number of valid measures , which I shall not reiterate .
<2en> However , I must in addition emphasise the need for pre-earthquake inspection and the reinforcement of structures where there is a problem , in both public and private buildings such as factories , colleges , recreation centres : I mean places where people gather in large numbers .
<2en> At the same time , we must protect and extend open spaces to accommodate the population after a catastrophic earthquake because the profitability of land has encouraged building development .
<2en> As regards new construction , the quality of materials and the reliability of builders ' must be verified , as human lives are sometimes disregarded in the interests of greater profit , as we know from earthquakes in Greece .
<2en> Special protection measures must first be applied in areas of higher seismic risk .
<2en> These are essentially densely built-up areas that are deprived socially , economically and in terms of housing .
<2en> It is right that there should be Community aid for restoration .
<2en> This is the people 's money .
<2en> The government will also have to adhere to procedures adapted to the soil and housing conditions of the area in order to provide the greatest possible earthquake protection and improvement of residential buildings .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to congratulate my fellow Member , Mr Vakalis , and thank the Commissioner , Mr Dimas , for the hope he is giving us for the future .
<2en> You can escape from fire , Mr President , and if you can swim , you can get away from floods .
<2en> In an earthquake , you can only hope to have God on your side .
<2en> Since this concerns our metaphysical aims and hopes , it would be good to have the EU on our side .
<2en> Sometimes , unfortunately , we do not , because we have seen the Solidarity Fund activated for only one earthquake incident , whereas in cases of flood and fire , it showed great willingness .
<2en> We understand , of course , that according to regulations , the damage should exceed 3 billion , but the houses that fall are not those of Onassis or Bill Gates ; they are the homes of the poor .
<2en> We can therefore bypass the regulations .
<2en> Since the Mediterranean region has often suffered intolerable ordeals verging on unfair physical punishment , we are calling , if possible , for the activation of the Structural Development Fund , the Solidarity Fund ( provided its strict rules can be moderated ) , the European Regional Development Fund and also the Civil Protection Fund .
<2en> This will permit the funding of vital research programmes and also allow the repair of damage , wherever this can humanly and fairly be achieved .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this excellent report by our colleague Mr Vakalis links in seamlessly to the three reports on natural disasters adopted by Parliament last year and is an important addition to them , for these previous reports did not deal with the issue of earthquakes .
<en> We know , however , that many countries and regions - especially in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region - have a high risk of earthquakes .
<en> I therefore endorse the rapporteur 's call for the Commission to draw up a communication evaluating the hazards posed by earthquakes and proposing the counter- and follow-up measures necessary to address them , as it recently did in the case of floods .
<en> The question of financing is key , of course , and as the rapporteur on the Solidarity Fund , I cannot understand why the Council is still dragging its feet on - indeed , has in effect shelved - the adaptation of the Solidarity Fund , which this House has endorsed .
<en> Immediate action is required here to ensure that this solidarity and funding instrument is available in future so that the damage caused by natural disasters , including earthquakes , can be remedied quickly , efficiently and flexibly .
<en> Without this flexibility , particularly in terms of the timetables and measures for funding , it has been shown in the past that the needs of earthquake victims have been virtually ignored .
<en> We must consider - as the previous speaker has said - that the Solidarity Fund that is currently still in place has only been used once in relation to earthquake damage .
<en> However , earthquakes are just as much natural disasters as floods , forest fires and storms .
<en> There are other forms of financing , in addition to direct funding , which should be used as well , however , such as regional state subsidies or loans from the European Investment Fund .
<en> This is the only way to ensure that appropriate resources are available to tackle earthquakes .
<en> The report makes a good contribution to this process .

<en> ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the sand in the Kosovo hourglass is trickling down relentlessly , and 10 December is almost upon us .
<en> Unfortunately the dialogue of the deaf continues between an extremely autonomous Kosovo inside Serbia 's borders and supervised independence .
<en> The legislative elections of 18 November only increased political aspirations , with the victory of the independence supporters in a ballot marked by a record abstention .
<en> The EU must therefore come up with a strategy other than independence , thereby affirming a European foreign policy .
<en> The very word independence is a trap , a synonym of chaos for our Europe .
<en> By accepting this process we are opening up a Pandora 's box with all the nationalisms , regionalisms and localisms this implies on our own territory .
<en> In a globalised world , independence is an illusion .
<en> A call must be made to all parties to build a regional community with peaceful exchanges which duly respect democratic principles .
<en> Supporting partition and independence will simply reinforce nationalisms .
<en> Let us remember the words of President François Mitterrand to Parliament : nationalism is war , and war is not only the past , but can also be our future .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , it is highly likely that Ireland will be the only European country to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> I myself am pro-EU and have voted ' yes ' in all Treaty referendums .
<en> However , I have a problem , and I am asking the Council to solve it .
<en> We need a consolidated version of the Treaty before we ask our citizens to make an informed choice .
<en> To illustrate my point , just look at page 51 of the Treaty , a section entitled ' Non-discrimination and citizenship ' , one which any citizen might want to read and assess .
<en> Point 32 states , ' Article 17 shall be replaced by the text of Article 12 . '
<en> Point 33 states , ' An Article 17a shall be inserted , with the wording of Article 13 ; in paragraph 2 , the words " when the Council adopts ” shall be replaced by " the European Parliament and the Council , acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure , may adopt the basic principles ” and the words at the end of the paragraph " it shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 ” shall be deleted . '
<en> Mr President , I do not need to read any more : I think the point is well made .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr. President , I am glad to see you today , three days after an extremely important moment for Romania .
<en> In compliance with the Treaty of Accession to the European Union , this Sunday , six months after the initially established term , Romania organized elections to the European Parliament .
<en> Thus , the citizens of Romania , European citizens , were able to directly elect those who represent them in the most democratic institution of the European Union .
<en> Even if the turn-out to the election was within the European average , that is not very high , I have the conviction that , due to the involvement of our new colleagues in Romania , Romanian citizens will become ever more aware of the impact the European Parliament 's activity has on their day-to-day life .
<en> The fact that extremist parties did not obtain the required number of votes to enter the European Parliament shows that Romanian citizens have already proved European maturity and responsibility .
<en> On this occasion , I would like to congratulate all those who were appointed by the citizens of Romania to represent them in the European Parliament and I hope to cooperate for the well-being of Romanians , irrespective of their membership in different political families .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Polish fishermen demonstrated in front of the European Commission 's headquarters in Brussels yesterday .
<en> They were protesting against the unfair and discriminatory action taken by the Commission against the Polish fishing industry .
<en> The problem relates to the ban on fishing for cod in the Baltic Sea .
<en> Cod is the main source of income for Polish fishermen .
<en> The fishing ban was imposed by the Commission as a punishment for exceeding the annual quota for cod catches .
<en> In addition , the Commission has threatened that Poland may not be allocated a fishing quota at all for 2008 , or that its quota will be reduced .
<en> That would certainly bankrupt the Polish fishing industry .
<en> The quotas allocated are very restrictive and are based on incomplete and distorted data concerning stocks of cod in the Baltic .
<en> Against this background , the question arises as to why Poland was the only country subjected to control , when my country called for detailed control of fishing in all countries .
<en> German , Swedish and Danish fishermen are also exceeding the quotas .
<en> Are Polish fishermen to become Commissioner Borg 's sacrificial lamb ?
<en> Alternatively , is this perhaps an effort to eliminate competition by recourse to the European Commission ?
<en> The Union has evidently failed to take the notion of equality on board , and I therefore support the protest .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I call for us to take up the cause of an Egyptian woman , Shadia Nagui Ibrahim .
<en> This woman was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment because , when she married , she allegedly stated untruthfully that she was a Christian .
<en> In fact , she stated the truth , because she is a Christian .
<en> She belongs to the Coptic Church and was unaware of the fact that her father , also a Coptic Christian , had converted to Islam for a time , and then returned to the Coptic faith .
<en> Under Egyptian law , Shadia Nagui Ibrahim is a Muslim , because her father was once a Muslim .
<en> A person 's faith cannot be determined by the position of national or legal authorities .
<en> It is a matter of personal conviction .
<en> If Egypt wishes to be deemed a civilised country , it must amend its intolerant anti-Christian legislation .

<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur Mrs Kallenbach , to the other shadow rapporteurs , and to Mrs McCarthy , Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , for seeing through this complicated legal package .
<en> When almost two years ago we started this work , we were assured that this would above all be a technical measure , the sole purpose of which was to use the UN Firearms Protocol to enable it to become EU legislation .
<en> The process , however , was anything but a technical one .
<en> Some wanted to ban weapons completely and restrict people 's legal enjoyment of them , whilst certain people did not want to see any kinds of controls on the purchase and use of weapons .
<en> Under the leadership of our rapporteur , Mrs Kallenbach , however , we found a balanced compromise among the main groups , one which takes account of the safety of individuals and society as well as the needs of those who enjoy using weapons as a pastime and hunters too , for example .
<en> It is a good thing that all weapons in the EU should be registered in order to make it easier to trace them and that Member States in future will have to keep the details of a weapon and its owner for a period of 20 years .
<en> It is also important that imitation and converted weapons should be covered under the directive .
<en> The lives of hunters and marksmen will be made a lot easier when the European Firearms Pass is the only document they need when travelling from one country to another , and there should be no fee charged for one .
<en> The age limit of 18 years old which is stipulated in the directive and its exceptions is sensible , in my view .
<en> It means , for example , that in my country , Finland , the thousands of registered underage hunters may continue to pursue their hobby with the permission of their parents , just as they have up until now .
<en> It is directives such as these which prove their worth in the eyes of the public .
<en> The EU 's Four Freedoms will likewise gain strength when the EU is developed as a safe area of internal rights .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , I too first of all would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Kallenbach , for a very well drafted report .
<en> It is important for everyone 's future to prevent the illegal manufacture of , and the trade in , firearms .
<en> The report will help achieve this objective .
<en> We Finns have been concerned about whether or not young people should be allowed to continue to hunt for pleasure .
<en> The sport is subject to licence in Finland and closely supervised , and there is guidance available from experienced hunters in the safe and responsible use of weapons .
<en> I think it is important that this best practice and long tradition in Finland will also be able to continue after the new directive has been adopted .
<en> It is important that tomorrow we agree a carefully prepared compromise , in which the different practices in the Member States are made compatible and the Member States can allow , subject to certain conditions , the purchase and possession of firearms for the purposes of hunting for under 18-year-olds too .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , it is very important to control possession of firearms if we wish to ensure the safety of people living in Europe .
<en> Clearly , any relevant provisions must not unduly restrict the right of citizens to ensure their own security on their own property , nor must they restrict their right to ensure their personal safety when undertaking important public duties or after having done so .
<en> In addition , citizens are entitled to possess weapons that are family heirlooms or are used in hunting or for sporting purposes .
<en> This is all part of Europe 's tradition .
<en> All restrictions should relate to the psychological state of the individual and should also apply to people suspected of offences classed as crimes .
<en> Furthermore , I believe such restrictions should apply to people who publicly advocate Fascism and radical Communism and to extremist Islamic activists .
<en> Technology is currently available in Europe allowing anyone good with their hands to create an amateur firearm relatively quickly .
<en> The implementation of undue restrictions will not therefore prevent the criminal fraternity from possessing firearms and will unduly restrict the rights of citizens , including their right to self-defence .
<en> Our border controls must be strengthened still further , because illegal immigrants are still managing to enter Europe and weapons can be smuggled in even more easily .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , the proposed changes to the EU 's weapons directive are aimed at improving the control of weapons .
<en> There will be better labelling and more stringent requirements on trade in and the manufacture of weapons .
<en> That is good , and it is especially good that the committee wants to tighten up these requirements even further .
<en> This issue takes on particular importance , seen in the context of the tragic fatal shootings at Jokela School in Finland a few weeks ago .
<en> The combination of drifting youngsters , the spread of a culture of violence on the Internet and access to weapons is unfortunately a lethal one .
<en> That is why the tighter measures we now have to adopt are immensely important .
<en> It is also good that this is a minimum requirements directive .
<en> In other words Member States can go further and have more progressive legislation .
<en> I would like all EU legislation to be on this basis .
<en> That would solve many problems .
<en> It looks as though we can reach agreement on first reading .
<en> That is good because it enables us to save time and resources which can be devoted to something else , for example work to bring about a more peaceful and more child-friendly society .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , hunting is an old-established custom .
<en> Every Member State has its unique hunting tradition to protect .
<en> Today 's debate therefore represents the conclusion to a long process .
<en> Strong wills have opposed one another , many discussions have taken place and the shadow rapporteur has been barred from taking part in the tripartite meetings .
<en> Many of the original proposals could have threatened the hunting cultures of Member States .
<en> Regrettably , the European Firearms Pass did not suffice as the only document needed for the occasional use of hunting and marksmen 's weapons in another Member State .
<en> Freedom of movement is prevented by the fact that certain Member States are permitted to require additional documents .
<en> Huntsmen and marksmen from the Community will be subject to greater bureaucracy than persons from third countries .
<en> Fortunately fees for such permits have been prohibited .
<en> In the course of the process , as shadow rapporteur , I tried to influence the final report on those occasions when I was permitted to participate in the meetings .
<en> My work focused mainly on two questions .
<en> I was concerned to prevent a ban on ordering weapons on the Internet and to forestall changes in the availability of exemptions for schools offering training in nature management and marksmanship .
<en> In remote regions a ban on the purchase of weapons on the internet would prevent access to weapons for hunting purposes .
<en> In Sweden today we have good regulations on internet purchases , which are accepted by both the hunting community and the authorities .
<en> The second question was about the minimum age criteria , which would affect various types of upper secondary school programme .
<en> In Sweden training in hunting performs an important function in teaching future generations about hunting and game conservation .
<en> Now our hunting traditions can live on .
<en> What had been an unwieldy bureaucratic proposal has now become an acceptable , though not ideal , compromise .

<en> The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a common frame of reference for European contract law by Mr Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0386 / 2007 ) .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is no secret that we have already failed once with just such an ambitious and necessary project : a European Civil Code .
<en> This is also most certainly connected with the fact that some legal systems here in the European Union have difficulty with written law .
<en> It is also most certainly connected with some others having difficulty with the idea that substantive rules on related themes are combined to some degree and administered conclusively and comprehensively enough and that ground rules are set outside the parentheses .
<en> The difficulties are also related to the fact that we in the European Union have common roots , yet these go way back , some having developed differently , some being buried and some being sacrificed to an arbitrary interpretation for the sake of the politics of the day .
<en> As the first President of the Federal Republic of Germany , Theodor Heuss , so aptly put it in 1956 - and please note that he was a Liberal - Europe is built on three hills : Golgotha , the Acropolis in Athens and the Capitol in Rome .
<en> The Acropolis is the symbol here for Greek scholarship , which with its great philosophers and political thinkers established the core of our democracies and state-building .
<en> Golgotha stands for Europe 's social and moral values , spreading widely across every area of our lives , from an understanding of family to human rights .
<en> The Capitol typifies Roman law , which helps us on the way to the rule of law and a sense of justice .
<en> As stated , however , our legal practices , while originating from the same roots , have grown apart - often so far apart that these roots are no longer recognisable .
<en> The sole foundation of this European Union appears to be the internal market .
<en> Some would say that all legal traditions of the nation states can continue to exist .
<en> However , this is far removed from any reality and also incidentally from any experience of life , when we live in an increasingly smaller , faster moving and more communicative world .
<en> The better we spell out the four Gospels of the Internal Market - the free movement of people , goods , capital and services - the more perfectly we can express them democratically and against a background of European moral concepts , and the clearer it becomes that all this is of no value if we cannot put its form on the test bench of the rule of law and justice , between individuals themselves as well as between individuals and state control .
<en> We have already failed once , when the Iron Curtain fell in Europe and countries were asking : do you have a law for us ?
<en> Perhaps this was understandable against a background of belief that any ramification of national legal traditions could survive , at any rate in a Union only able to negotiate unanimously .
<en> We must not fail a second time , however .
<en> This is perhaps the most serious challenge alongside the issue of language .
<en> The clearer we are in spelling out our internal market , the clearer the basic need for the unity of the law , not just vertically , but also horizontally over the entire geography of the continent .
<en> We have moved forward .
<en> We already have competition now in the legal systems .
<en> It would be good , and we would have enough time , if this were not the external reality .
<en> Conflict among Europeans can benefit only those who are powerful and already have redundant legal systems .
<en> We are not a family with brothers and sisters who quarrel with one another so that sparks fly , but are united in the face of outside challenges .
<en> We do not allow ourselves to be fazed by outside challenges .
<en> Oblivious to the world - self-obsessed .
<en> People 's desire for unity is therefore there , even though it subsequently creates a problem in individual regulations .
<en> Fears are created on the basis of the powers of national policies to cultivate doctrines of self-interest - a strategy that threatens the collapse of the historical dimensions on a continental scale .
<en> We have to come to an agreement because otherwise we ourselves will ultimately not hold on to anything .
<en> Since the grand plan has not succeeded , we need to agree on what is possible .
<en> The toolbox is therefore good , the reference framework is therefore good , and so it is good to sort out what is possible and a little bit more perhaps as well .
<en> The European Parliament is therefore largely in agreement and has also repeatedly expressed this in its resolutions .
<en> We therefore want to know from the Commission how ambitious it is in wanting to tackle this aim .
<en> This is why we are asking questions the way we have .
<en> The Continent and its people require a uniform rule of law , at least in the form ... at any rate in what the legal practitioner calls the general part .
<en> We can build on this ; we need justice in terms of a balanced compromise of legitimate interests , we need speed , law in the public domain and law intelligible to everyone .
<en> Even if it is only contract law that is up for debate today , the need for action in other fields is evident : family law , inheritance law , administrative law - yes , even criminal law .
<en> It is the method that is on the test bench in what the Commission is now starting .
<en> The method will essentially be the determining factor when answering the question of how much , how quickly and how well we are able to react to the obvious challenges .
<en> Many of us throughout the world are waiting for a successful example and many are simply expecting us to fail .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , it comes as no surprise that this question attracts such attention , because this is a really pivotal and very important issue .
<en> The Commission , as a whole , welcomes wholeheartedly the interest that Parliament is taking in the Common Frame of Reference ( CFR ) .
<en> In its second progress report , the Commission announced that , after the academic CFR has been provided by the researchers , the Commission will carefully select the parts of this draft that correspond to the common legislative objectives .
<en> As we know from the decision , this academic CFR is due by the end of this year .
<en> The selection process will be done in consultation with the other institutions , including Parliament and stakeholders , and I think that Parliament , which has many experts here , will play an important role as usual .
<en> The Commission has not yet decided how to proceed in selecting those parts of the academic CFR which will be incorporated into the final Commission CFR , as this decision also depends on the content of the draft CFR that the researchers will deliver .
<en> Also , the Commission has not yet decided which topics of the EU contract law acquis the CFR should cover .
<en> In adopting this decision , the Commission will also take into account the content of the academic CFR - which we have not had so far - the outcome of the new CFR workshops , and the position of Parliament and the Council .
<en> The Commission has , however , clearly stated several times that the CFR will not be a large-scale harmonisation of private law or a European civil code .
<en> The future framework directive , as a result of the review of the consumer contract law acquis , is not dependent on the outcome of the CFR , which is a longer-term project and run separately .
<en> The Commission will ensure that the parts of the research draft selected for the CFR - and possibly modified - are coherent with each other and with the future framework directive .
<en> All this preparatory work will be carried out by all the Commission directorates-general involved , in close coordination .
<en> In respect of consumer issues , my services have already carried out the respective workshops and analysed the outcome .
<en> The results already serve as a starting point for the review of the consumer contract law acquis , and it was very helpful .
<en> My fellow Commissioner , Mr McCreevy , recently held two workshops on information requirements in financial services legislation and on unfair competition rules for business-to-business ( ' B-to-B ' ) contracts .
<en> Concerning general contract law , the services of Vice-President Frattini plan to organise several workshops during next year .
<en> The Commission fully understands that Parliament wants to be kept informed of , and involved in , the ongoing work on the CFR .
<en> We welcome Parliament 's involvement in the CFR process .
<en> In addition to the consultation which I mentioned earlier , the Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way , in particular through the Parliament working group dedicated to the CFR .
<en> I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its support of the Commission 's work on this important dossier .
<en> I know that one of the major events in 2006 - if I am not mistaken - took place in Vienna , and the outcome of that conference was very inspiring for our work .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to thank you most sincerely for your commitment to this matter .
<en> It has brought with it great progress in the development of this project in past months .
<en> I should say at this juncture that I regard this project as the most important in the entire legislative term , although it is actually a pre-legislative rather than a legislative project .
<en> Of course , we as Parliament do have an enormous interest - and this is also the key reason why this oral question was tabled again today - in the fact that we are very consciously keeping up the suspense and keeping the discussion going not only at the level of the working group we have set up and at committee level , but also here with you in plenary .
<en> It is therefore also important that we have put this on the agenda today .
<en> We also want to find something out from you - you are still not able to say much about the definite schedule - because from Parliament 's point of view it is also significant , of course , in view of the upcoming elections in 2009 , for our strategy as to how we continue to deal with the Frame of Reference .
<en> Over the coming year there will be a preliminary draft , but there will not be a final text until April 2009 .
<en> In any case it will be so late that it will presumably no longer be possible to deal with the content in depth in this legislative term and the next Parliament will therefore have to do so in the next term of office .
<en> I wish to emphasise very clearly once again that we think the Frame of Reference , if it is adopted by the Commission and inserted into the consultation document , must not to refer to subjects of contract law alone , and Parliament has continually made it clear by an outsize majority that this must go beyond the framework of pure contract law in order to have the desired effect .
<en> We also want specifically to be able to consider the option of whether we can subsequently solve the many problems we have in the internal market in the shape of an optional instrument for cross-border businesses .
<en> At the moment we have a situation in which we are having to live in a happy coexistence of the country of origin principle and country of destination principle alongside the many directives and European legislative decisions with up to 28 legal systems , all of which have also to be simultaneously applied - depending on the circumstances .
<en> This is not right in practice because nobody - no solicitor , judge or barrister - is in a position to know 28 European legal systems .
<en> Against this background one optional instrument could be an instrument that actually opens up the internal market , particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises , as well as for the consumer , and throws open every kind of possibility in the internal market .
<en> All the activities of the Commission and Parliament should be aimed at keeping this option open so that a final decision can be made on this in the next legislative term .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , the fact that we are here , at this late hour , discussing the common frame of reference , is an indication that at least those of us who are here have a strong interest in this issue , and the Commissioner herself has indicated the interest that she and other Commissioners have in the matter .
<en> I think , as we all do , that the procedure being adopted by the Commission is the correct one .
<en> Before launching into a codification project , it is important that we understand its elements from an academic point of view , and we think that the initiative is a magnificent one : not just launching into legislative proposals without having considered them first .
<en> I think that the result could be quite good .
<en> With regard to the second phase , however , with which we are concerned , as some MEPs are working on or taking part in the parliamentary group that is monitoring the common frame of reference , what we are finding is that apparently so much material has now been accumulated that selection seems to be difficult .
<en> My fellow Member , Mr Lehne , referred to the temporary framework ; in other words , although the codification project is a long-term project , it is nevertheless helpful for us to at least start to look at the guidelines for the project .
<en> The idea of a framework directive on this issue seems to be a good starting point .
<en> In any case , it is clear that what we have done in recent years towards harmonisation through procedures , legislation and the recognition and enforcement of sentences is useful , but does have huge limitations .
<en> European law in general and contractual law in particular can only be developed by establishing certain principles .
<en> I think that Parliament as an institution could be a magnificent instrument for the Commission to use , because the different legal systems and different national legislations are represented here , and it could be an excellent framework of reference in order to see the extent to which the harmonising proposals are ultimately going to clash with the national legal systems .
<en> The harmonisation of the European Union is quite difficult for reasons that we are all aware of , but the correct procedure is the one undertaken by the Commission , with this initial academic phase and a second legislative phase .
<en> What we are saying to the Commission at the moment is that , in Parliament , we feel a certain amount of time pressure , because European integration is already happening : European citizens are facing practical problems every day that can only be resolved through legal harmonisation .
<en> These practical problems were considered by the Commissioner herself when she presented her proposals for the harmonisation of contractual law on consumer protection , which is just one of the aspects , but quite an important one , because , in short , in the European Union we are all consumers and to some extent it is an excellent principle for taking action .
<en> I do not think that it is a question of creating a common frame of reference that is purely theoretical .
<en> As far as possible , specifics are the most useful thing .
<en> My fellow Member Mr Lehne referred to establishing some type of optional document .
<en> The model would be something like the United States Uniform Commercial Code , which has been described as the least uniform code of all , giving the least possibility of unification .
<en> This is a possibility , but perhaps the most important thing may be to see which principles can be recognised by all the legal systems , and we will really only have this information once we have studied and taken into account what the academics give us .
<en> Therefore , Commissioner , I think that Parliament will be a good collaborator in the subsequent development of this legislation and here we already have a degree of impatience to get to work , so that , in the year and a half that remains of the legislature , we can contribute positively to the development of this legislation .
<chp>

<en> Madam President , as someone who has followed , through the Committee on Budgetary Control , a number of the Court of Auditors ' reports concerning misappropriations and fraudulent spending of monies from the agriculture budget , I must say how pleased I am to see this Parliament welcoming new technology in many different ways , especially in this field of agriculture .
<en> I hope that in future years this information - as one of the amendments in this report suggested - can be spread via the internet to all those people across the European Union who would like to see it , especially to the various national audit authorities in each Member State so they can see , for example , if in Greece they are claiming more acreage for olive-producing land than they actually have .
<en> I am also standing up because I want to talk about the Constitutional Treaty .
<en> I want to make sure that this House gets a say and that people get a referendum in the future , and that is why I am giving explanations of votes on all reports .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , it may not be obvious why , as a representative of London , I am giving an explanation of vote on a matter concerning farming and the common agricultural policy .
<en> But we have to recognise that the common agricultural policy also affects consumers right across the EU in the form of higher prices .
<en> Therefore it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that we are monitoring how taxpayers ' money is spent in a number of areas , including the common agricultural policy .
<en> I understand that , in response to the common agricultural policy management needs , there is considerable need for information on land use , and that is why I think we all welcome the use of better technology .
<en> I hope that many of my constituents will benefit in terms of providing that technology .
<en> I also have to agree with my colleague that one of the reasons I am giving an explanation of vote is because the people of Europe and the people of Britain should be given a say on the Constitutional Treaty in the form of a referendum .
<sp>
<en> I would like to remind colleagues that we are taking explanations of vote on the reports concerned .
<en> If anybody tries to speak about anything else , I am afraid I will stop your speech , in accordance with the Rules .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I will with pleasure speak on the report itself .
<en> The Graefe zu Baringdorf report , explaining as it does the new methods to address fraud and agrarian policy under the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , is dealing with one of the most inefficient , expensive , wasteful , bureaucratic and amoral systems of farm support known to man , and no amount of agro-meteorological gimmickry can rescue it .
<en> Extrapolate from the experience of the CAP ; infer from it .
<en> Before handing new powers to any organisation , we should first look at how it exercises the powers it already controls .
<en> Agriculture has been , since 1960 , the European Union 's chief competence .
<en> Look at the mess it has made - the ecological destruction , the destruction of surpluses , the poverty inflicted on Africa .
<en> Is this the institution that we now want to put in charge of foreign policy , of criminal justice , of defence , and if it is , should we not consult the people in the referendums that we were promised ?
<en> The Elder Cato is supposed to have ended every speech , whatever its subject , with the demand that Carthage be destroyed .
<en> I shall end mine with the demand that the Lisbon Treaty be put to the people : Pactio Olisipio censenda est !
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I do not think any of us should be unduly concerned about new technology , but it is important that it is properly used and not abused .
<en> But there is much abuse , particularly in southern Europe in regard to the common agricultural policy , and I trust this technology may do something towards eliminating this .
<en> If it does , we could save much more than the EUR 400 that someone complained about when it comes to bringing transparency to voting .
<en> I note that this report talks about remote sensing .
<en> Well , I would also say this : if Europe could get a sense of democratic sensing , then it would sense across Europe a great resentment at the shutting out of citizens and the denying to them of the right to express their opinion on the most important matter , namely the matter of how they should be governed .
<chp>

<en> President-in-Office . - ( SL ) I strongly reiterate that it is not within the competence of the Council , or even customary for the Council , to adopt a position regarding individual television programmes or their comments .
<en> In no way does this diminish the enormity of the problem you are talking about .
<en> However , I personally see the solution in what you said in your question , i.e. in the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities .
<en> That is precisely why , in my initial answer , I mentioned the resolution adopted by the Council in December 2007 , which calls on the Member States to ratify said convention .
<sp>
<en> Subject : Negotiating date for Macedonia
<en> Does the Council foresee the possibility this year , i.e. during the Slovenian or French Presidency of the Council , of setting a date for launching accession negotiations with Macedonia ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office . - ( SL ) I still do not know ; sometimes it switches itself on and sometimes it doesn 't .
<en> I apologise for these gaps .
<en> Of course , the Council does not and cannot exclude the possibility cited by Mr Posselt in his question .
<en> As we know , in December 2005 the European Council decided to accord candidate status to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
<en> In accordance with the Council decisions of 12 December 2005 , i.e. a few days prior to the session of the European Council , the country had to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement fully .
<en> The Commission has been preparing progress reports on this basis , and the 2006 and 2007 reports do not contain recommendations for the start of accession negotiations , the argument being that appropriate measures have still not been implemented .
<en> In 2008 the Presidency is expecting the leadership of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , from the entire political spectrum , to join forces in strengthening efforts to reach results in all the various fields where progress is needed , and , in view of the events in the country , especially the progress made over the last month , I would estimate that it should be possible this year to come a step closer to deciding on a date for the start of accession negotiations .
<en> The Slovenian Presidency is very keen on it , very keen on that progress , but it does depend on the country itself and on its success in exercising the measures , as well as the progress of reforms .
<sp>
<en> - ( DE ) Many thanks for this very good response .
<en> Allow me as an exception to make a personal preliminary remark .
<en> In 1991 , when Slovenia gained independence , I was at the independence celebrations in Ljubljana - as the only EU citizen , I believe .
<en> I was also in favour of the Association Agreement during the war in Ljubljana which , thankfully , was brief , and later as rapporteur for Parliament .
<en> I would simply like to say that today is a historic day for me .
<en> I am very happy .
<en> Please forgive the personal preliminary remark .
<en> Now an even shorter question : do you believe that the naming issue between Macedonia and Greece is a bilateral issue , and can a bilateral issue have an impact on accession negotiations ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office . - ( SL ) I would like to thank Mr Posselt for his support since the days of our independence .
<en> Actually , Slovenia has journeyed a long way , as was said by the President of the European Council this morning .
<en> Regarding your question , it is basically a bilateral matter of the name .
<en> However , we all know that for the resolution of this basically bilateral question , there is a mechanism , under United Nations patronage , involving a special representative , Mr Nimec , who is committed to mediating between both sides to bring about a solution .
<en> Slovenia , i.e. the Slovenian Presidency , supports these efforts and expects both sides to cooperate in a constructive way in this process until a proper solution is found .
<en> In the meantime , we are of the opinion that this question should not affect , let alone hinder , the integration of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into international organisations .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Overall , this resolution merely repeats general ideas , and is inadequate in various areas .
<en> Hence our abstention .
<en> For instance , since the main objective is to reduce CO2 emissions produced by burning fossil fuels , the issue of measuring those emissions arises .
<en> We know that this measurement is very complex and can be manipulated , since fossil fuels , after extraction , are transported and processed , and their by-products distributed and used in many ways , at thousands of end points .
<en> As various specialists in the field have indicated , to reduce emissions and achieve targets , it is more effective and simpler to monitor an instrument approved under a protocol on the extraction and international marketing of fossil fuels .
<en> Thus , it would be easier to set rates or targets for reducing primary fossil fuel production , and corresponding exports / imports , thus setting maximum emissions limits by country .
<en> But there is also a need to negotiate commitments by the richer countries to release funds to support developing countries , to help them bear the economic and social costs of the necessary measures .
<en> I regret that the Group 's proposals to that end were rejected .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Last December , the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in Bali , having made progress on many aspects relating to global climate protection .
<en> In addition to the start of negotiations on a new protocol to replace the Kyoto Protocol , I would highlight the statement that the fourth IPCC Report was a better scientific basis for the Convention 's work , and the reference , for the first time - thus ending the taboo - to developing countries also having to cooperate , obviously taking account of their economic context and their development .
<en> Finally , I believe that the major innovation at Bali was the inclusion , for the first time , of the issue of deforestation which , as part of the Bali Action Plan , will be discussed with a view to its inclusion in the future Protocol .
<en> I am voting in favour of the resolution of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change since it supports the outcome achieved in Bali , makes a number of observations on the role of the EU in future negotiations , with which I agree , and specifies where the Bali Action Plan could have gone further .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report .
<en> The Thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , held in Bali from 3 to 15 December , was supposed to set out a schedule for the next two years and reach an agreement extending the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
<en> Although the first objective appears to have been met , we are still a long way from achieving the second .
<en> It is most regrettable that the international community was not able to agree on a target figure for the stabilisation then reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20 % from their 1990 level by 2020 .
<en> The European Union should strengthen the constructive and proactive role it was able to play in Bali so as not to provide the countries that reject all targets with an excuse to refuse to act .
<en> Although the Bali agreement , which was signed by all the countries present , should be welcomed , we should not give way to a new set of environmental platitudes .
<en> There are still two years in which to reach an agreement , and hesitations over the roadmap indicate that the toughest part is still to come .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The Bali Conference resolution on climate change is seeking to find positive signs where there are none .
<en> At the same time , it conceals the cause of environmental destruction : the plundering of natural resources by capital in order to profit from the commercialisation of the land , air , energy and water .
<en> The resolution points ahead to the danger that climate change ' could be a major factor in destabilisation of the poorest countries ' .
<en> This Euro-monopoly capital can use climate change as a pretext for further exploiting the developing countries , as we know that the activity of the multinationals is one of the major reasons for poverty .
<en> The resolution calls for serious commitment from the emerging nations , in accordance with their development stage and the composition of their economies .
<en> It refers more specifically to China and India on the issue of promoting cooperation on energy policy to limit pollutants .
<en> Essentially it aims to put pressure on them by curbing their developing potential and their claims to larger market shares in the face of imperialist competition for the allocation of markets .
<en> Perhaps this is why there is no reference to measures for the direct reduction of greenhouse gas emissions , and why there are only general expressions of good intent .
<en> In a nutshell , climate change at the Bali conference was mere window-dressing .
<en> The real issues were the intensifying of intra-imperialist conflicts in the energy sector and the commercialisation of the environment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I fully support the resolution 's assessment of the outcome of the Bali Summit negotiations .
<en> Thanks to the EU , Bali achieved more than might have been expected , but less than was needed .
<en> The lack of agreement among all negotiating parties on concrete objectives and figures for the reduction of CO2 emissions is regrettable .
<en> I voted in favour of the resolution .

<en> Mr President , does a peasant suffering from AIDS have the right to access medicine and treatment that he cannot afford ?
<en> Does a child born in poverty have the human right to receive basic education and appropriate vaccines to protect him from killer diseases ?
<en> Does a peasant farmer devastated by natural disasters such as drought , pests and soil erosion have the right to our assistance ?
<en> Do millions of people living in misery for political reasons in isolated countries like Palestine and Iraq have any rights ?
<en> What do we mean when we talk about human rights ?
<en> I urge every colleague concerned with human rights to visit , unannounced and informally , any peasant in any poor country and ask him about our views on human rights , political freedom , economic freedom , religious freedom , free access to education and health services .
<en> That peasant will look at you in bewilderment and plead : " All I need is a supply of fresh water to my house .
<en> All I need is a source of energy so that I can light my house and cook the next meal " .
<en> Internal conflict and civil war resulting in violation of human rights will continue to impoverish the poor until we help them to do the following .
<en> Firstly , to have a stake in their rural economies .
<en> They need to own their own land , their home and their farm .
<en> And secondly , to acquire the technology to break the cycle of dependency on us and seize the opportunity to be self-sufficient , self-reliant through their own local enterprise .
<en> When the poor have an economic stake , then civil society and democracy will take root .
<en> These people will see the need for law and order and political representation .
<en> Then you will see the courts replacing the bullet - and that is when we will see human rights .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , unfortunately I was not in the chamber when the content of the human rights report was being discussed .
<2en> At that moment , we had a problem outside with a small group of people who do not agree with the situation in the Turkish prisons .
<2en> This was why I was not in the chamber .
<2en> However , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Cornillet , for his report , as he offers a good approach with this report .
<2en> I am particular impressed by its structure .
<2en> We have already talked about this .
<2en> It is quite right to link this report with the human rights charter .
<2en> This is certainly the right decision and was undoubtedly a tremendous challenge , and there will have to be a great many further amendments .
<2en> We all agree on this .
<2en> In terms of its content , however , I should also like to comment on what we have witnessed around Parliament today .
<2en> In his report , Mr Cornillet has addressed the situation of prisons in the European Union .
<2en> I should simply like briefly to remind us all of one thing : we often visit other countries and criticise the accession countries , especially about conditions in prisons .
<2en> Conditions in prisons in the accession countries are unacceptable , in our view .
<2en> Yet reading through Mr Cornillet ' s report , it is apparent that we have a great many problems with our own prisons in our own countries .
<2en> This should not merely be noted down by you on paper : the governments in the European Union must take steps to address this situation .
<2en> In any event , some thought must be given to this issue as well .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Wuori , for his excellent report .
<en> Slavery was abolished in the nineteenth century , but now it is estimated that people are being sold from their countries at a rate of four million a year , and the number is growing .
<en> The global markets are so free that human bodies now have a market value .
<en> The violent trade in human organs focuses on the poor .
<en> Some poor people positively rise from their graves , in a manner of speaking , when their organs are transplanted into living people .
<en> The problem is also that human rights violations have become ever more profitable and , in a society of greed , it takes money to protect human rights .
<en> We therefore face the sort of problem that results from greed .
<en> The most widespread is the numbing of the human brain in the name of business .
<en> The global mass entertainment of television creates a false world , a virtual world , where every kind of business or trade flourishes and the importance of democracy is diminished .
<en> The international sex trade has acquired an excellent tool in the Internet .
<en> Legislation lags behind because many people think the freedom of the Internet should not be restricted .
<en> I suggest that we establish a European body to make rules for the protection of privacy in the information society era .
<en> The notion of human rights will not work where they are being violated both mentally and physically .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the annual report on human rights in the world shows a good grasp of what is currently at stake .
<2en> However , the European Union must state more clearly the action it intends to take in three areas .
<2en> First of all , history shows us how difficult it is to ensure that human rights are respected in countries where economic development does not exist or is extremely poor .
<2en> This evidence should be given greater emphasis .
<2en> This means that we should create a global-development methodology , bringing together converging criteria , centred around a principle which I shall refer to as the ' evolutionary principle ' .
<2en> Secondly , the report points the finger at a number of countries which do not respect human rights .
<2en> If we are to avoid falling into the trap of having one law for the rich and another for the poor , and in order to ensure that any action taken by Europe has credibility , we should place greater emphasis on the inseparability of human rights within and outside the boundaries of a state .
<2en> Finally , we must acknowledge the special responsibility of those countries which have achieved a high level of democracy and development but which , instead of setting an example , cynically continue to disregard human rights .
<2en> The developed countries must set an example to the developing countries , and not the other way round .
<2en> Our action will be on a long-term basis .
<2en> We must insist , loudly and clearly , that human rights are a universal value and do not depend on circumstances .
<2en> With that in mind , it is absolutely essential that Europe should think about setting up a programme of project study and development in the area of human rights , which will take our political will into account .
<2en> That is the price that Europe will have to pay in order to gain credibility .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , given the small amount of time available to me , I am not going to waste a single second on rhetoric or demagoguery and , therefore , I am going to concentrate on issues which , from my point of view , are more significant .
<2en> I would firstly like to say that I completely agree with Commissioner Vitorino when he says that the European Union should first teach by example and then preach .
<2en> I also wish to congratulate Mr Cornillet on the excellent work he has done , despite a lack of resources .
<2en> His work clearly reflects the fact that within the European Union there are still groups and people who suffer discrimination , whose fundamental rights are not properly respected .
<2en> I therefore believe that we must make greater efforts in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty , as well as Article 13 , after Amsterdam , since those groups mentioned in Article 13 are still suffering discrimination and a lack of respect for their fundamental rights .
<2en> I am referring to issues as regrettable as racism , which still takes place in the Member States ; discrimination as a result of the sexual orientation of certain groups , specifically homosexuals , who still suffer legislative discrimination in certain Member States ; the protection of disabled people ; women , that vast group that suffers discrimination ; and immigrants , which this report reveals to be the new group which suffers the greatest discrimination .
<2en> Unlike some speakers , I would like to say that I am in favour of recognising the right to vote of immigrants , who only then will enjoy sufficient respect for their rights .

<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I voted against the report because I am uneasy over what it will mean for the future .
<en> I am not opposed to pitching in and helping each other in crisis situations , but it must happen as and when required and in a natural way .
<en> I do not think it is justified to have joint exercises at EU taxpayers ' expense , and I am absolutely opposed to foreign agents operating and exercising authority on Swedish territory with retained immunity .
<en> The logical consequence is a development towards a common police force , to which I am entirely opposed .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The text before us is attempting to give a legal framework to operations carried out by special intervention units of one Member State sent to the territory of another , in the event of a terrorist attack .
<en> Because these interventions can be so diverse ( exchange of equipment , expertise , active units , etc . ) , it is left up to the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements to define the practical arrangements and to decide whether to accept or refuse the request for intervention on their territory of one of these operational units .
<en> Unbelievable .
<en> Finally , here is a real case of the application of that controversial and complicated principle of subsidiarity !
<en> Finally , here is an area - that of national security , the sovereign area par excellence - that is resisting the supranational bulldozer of a Europe that legislates on everything , everywhere .
<en> For effectiveness in the fight against terrorism , then , Europe is putting its money on cooperation between national police forces .
<en> We support this initiative .
<en> But the key to victory over terrorism does not lie solely in cooperation .
<en> It requires an awareness of the revolutionary desire of Islamists , who advocate the destruction of humanist and Christian Western society and its values .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We voted for the report because it is based on voluntary action and cooperation such as can only be brought about by a reciprocal agreement between two Member States .
<en> However , we hold to the principle that foreign agents should not be allowed to operate or exercise authority on Swedish territory with retained immunity .
<en> We can see this leading to the possible development of a common police force , about which we have serious misgivings .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( CS ) Allow me an explanatory remark concerning voting on the report on the European Research Area .
<en> The European Research Area , discussed here endlessly , is a very good idea and a very good vision .
<en> However , there is still a long way to go before it becomes a reality .
<en> Talking is not enough .
<en> We also have to assess how it functions and indeed whether it functions at all .
<en> Being a Member of this Parliament who represents a new country , I know from my own experience that at this stage the European Research Area is only an illusion and wishful thinking .
<en> The first available data on the priority given to projects involving new Member States demonstrates this .
<en> Out of 559 subsidies approved under the grant for young scientists , only two went to the Czech Republic ( none whatsoever went to Poland , which is several times bigger ! ) , while over 100 went to the United Kingdom and 80 to Germany .
<en> It is difficult to believe that the difference in the quality of the projects was big enough to justify such numbers .
<en> Of course , the lack of experience of the people submitting projects in the new Member States is partly to blame .
<en> At any rate , this indicates that so far the European Research Area has not been functioning as it should .
<en> We therefore need less talk and more action to achieve tangible results .
<en> It must be said that in this regard we are still lagging behind .
<sp>
<2en> This report contains some contradictions and positions that we do not endorse .
<2en> However , it is true that scientific research must go back to its main mission : the creation of new knowledge .
<2en> The truth is that there is no linear relationship between R & D and innovation , though there are certain correlations , but they are complex and have to do with areas well outside the realm of science .
<2en> The perception of research as a sort of panacea to solve all economic and social problems therefore needs to be corrected , and more needs to be invested in research .
<2en> Some steps taken at the Lisbon European Council in 2000 were a reaction to the concerns about Europe 's underinvestment in the knowledge economy , and this was further reinforced at the Barcelona European Council in 2002 , where the EU set itself the objective of reaching an R & D intensity of 3 per cent by 2010 .
<2en> However , the growth in its R & D spending since 2000 has been insufficient , averaging only 1.84 % , partly borne by industry .
<2en> Private sector investment in research is lower than the socially optimum level .
<2en> States must play a central role and develop cooperation to make it possible to create new knowledge , making it available to society as a whole .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SL ) After the changes that have taken place , our task is not to explain history or to spread alarm by talking about the domino effect , but to support the development which will ultimately stabilise the region and bring it closer to European standards and a European perspective .
<en> It is an important fact in this extremely complicated story that the European Union has taken on a big responsibility .
<en> It was united in its decision on the EULEX mission to help in the building-up of institutions and in political and economic development .
<en> The European Commission has also set out measures to support the development of the wider region .
<en> All this is aimed at defusing this dangerous situation that offers no prospects , and removing the unusual paradox that part of Europe , surrounded by the Member States , is a protectorate of the United Nations .
<en> It is not only my wish , but also the wish of others , that the reconciliation , peace and cooperation which now characterise the European Union may become a key principle or a foundation for coexistence within Kosovo , as well as in the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo .
<en> In these demanding days for both Serbia and Kosovo , and in the spirit of what I said earlier , I would like to welcome the words and actions of all those who have expressed their commitment to peace , moderation , openness and the future .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , we are faced with a state of affairs that may have far-reaching consequences , not only for the Balkan region but also internationally .
<en> The claim that it is a sui generis case does not indemnify us .
<en> The circumvention of international law and its rules is highly dangerous .
<en> For the first time , borders have been changed with neither the agreement of the parties involved , nor the approval of the Security Council .
<en> Once again , Europe has appeared divided on such a vital issue and has repeated the mistakes of the past .
<en> The extent to which the 2 000-strong force can guarantee safety and stability in the region is also in doubt .
<en> The declaration of Kosovo 's independence is now a fact .
<en> We support a peaceful , multi-ethnic Kosovo integrated in the bosom of the EU .
<en> The solution to the crisis can only be to secure the path to rapid unification of the Western Balkans with the EU .
<en> The immediate signing of the Stability and Growth Pact is necessary , especially for Serbia , as the only way of providing real support for its democratic forces .
<en> Finally , the way the situation is handled will be a crucial test for European foreign policy .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I fail to see the rush to resolve the Kosovo issue , circumventing the UN and ignoring current international law .
<en> I believe that Kosovo 's new nationhood will be difficult , with no obvious exit strategy for the EU , whose presence will be long term , given a hostile Serbia next door and the prevalence of organised crime .
<en> Independent Kosovo 's acceptance by Russia and China , who are on the UN Security Council , is very unlikely in the foreseeable future .
<en> We have now managed successfully to injure a Serbia trying to forget Milošević and build a democratic future .
<en> Its loss may fan nationalist sentiments and drive Serbia towards Russia , which , in turn , may apply the precedence of the Kosovo situation in frozen conflicts ranging from Transnistria to Abkhazia .
<en> Russia will , interestingly , now claim the moral high ground in international law - perhaps for the first time in recent history .
<en> I have considerable sympathy with Cyprus , which has refused to join the majority of EU Member States in recognising Kosovo .
<en> Already , Mr Talat , the leader of the so-called ' breakaway republic of Northern Cyprus ' claims Kosovo as a precedent for his territory .
<en> As an aside to Mr Howitt - UN talks also failed over the unification of Cyprus , so that issue is not unique to this case .
<en> Not surprisingly , Spain is concerned about the Basque Country and Catalonia , and Slovakia about its Hungarian minority .
<en> Curiously , although the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) has welcomed an independent Kosovo as a potential new member , Azerbaijan , although in the OIC , is wary over Nagorno-Karabakh claiming independence and refuses to recognise Kosovo .
<en> Therefore , whatever the EU and the US are saying about this issue being sui generis , clearly not all the countries of the world agree .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to make two points .
<en> Firstly , the most important thing is that the independence of Kosovo was proclaimed after supervision of the situation there by the international community for a number of years , and the international community , after long deliberations , could not find a better solution to the problem than the independence of Kosovo .
<en> Therefore , following Russian attempts to relate the situation of Kosovo to some other regions of Europe , like Transnistria , South Ossetia or Abkhazia , it is not difficult to make this counter-argument dangerous or not suitable for Moscow itself .
<en> Would Russia agree to withdraw from those territories and leave control of the ' frozen conflicts ' areas of Europe to the international community ?
<en> If so , then we , the EU , would get a real chance to reach a long-awaited solution , and we should be interested in this .
<en> Secondly , it is well known that some countries try to warm their hands above the embers of each fireplace of international instability .
<en> This time , Russia , pretending to defend the interests of Serbia , decided to play its own geopolitical game , pretending that , without its assent , no problem in the world would be solved .
<en> This position is not new or unexpected .
<en> But Russia is not the most important player this time , as it does not have real power to angle events in a way which would not be acceptable for the West .
<en> For instance , in the future , Kosovo 's attempts to join the United Nations might not be easy , but Russia cannot achieve any significant isolation of the state on the international stage because , when Kosovo is recognised by a majority of EU Member States , the United States and some other countries , the isolation will become meaningless .
<en> I salute the independence of Kosovo and wish the Kosovar people the best of luck in building their state .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the difference between the external actions of the EU and other international actors is respect for international legality and UN decisions .
<en> I am afraid that , by encouraging and recognising the independence of Kosovo outside the current body of international legality and the UN , that defining characteristic of EU external actions becomes questionable , if not even untenable .
<en> I only hope that we will not live to regret the decision we have taken with respect to Kosovo .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> - ( NL ) Mr President , some of my colleagues have already touched on the fact that it is no exaggeration to state that following the attacks on President Ramos Horta , East Timor is once again entering a critical phase .
<en> I will say it again , because who does not recall the pictures from last year , following the appointment of Gusmão , of hundreds of houses and some government buildings in flames ?
<en> Indeed , an international force is probably necessary in order to deal with the current crisis .
<en> However , it certainly must not create the impression by so doing that the government needs foreign soldiers to protect itself against its own people .
<en> A foreign force can maintain stability by manu militari in the short term , but in the long term the people of East Timor themselves must ensure their own future .
<en> In order to guarantee political stability , democracy and respect for human rights in the long term , in the first place they need an independent and reliable media , they need a reformed police force and they need a sound judicial system .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , East Timor is widely considered to be the most successful example of a transformation process in the history of the United Nations .
<en> East Timor does , however , seem to have forgotten the sacrifices it made during its war of independence to put an end to its brutal occupation by Indonesia lasting 24 years , and the joy with which it celebrated its own independence .
<en> Less than six years after regaining its independence , however , East Timor now stands on the brink of chaos .
<en> The transition to democracy and independence is never easy .
<en> It is not the end of the journey but only the beginning .
<en> One thing is absolutely certain , however , namely that violence never can be and never has been the way to deal with problems .
<en> That must be made quite clear .
<en> The way to resolve problems is through dialogue , political pluralism , strengthening democratic institutions such as the parliament , an independent judicial system and governments working under democratically elected leaders .
<en> I call on the Council and the European Commission to ensure that as much as possible of the assistance allocated to East Timor under the 10th European Development Fund is devoted to strengthening democracy .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Thank you , Mr President .
<en> Eighteen months have now passed since the last European Parliament resolution on East Timor .
<en> Officially , this country became independent in 2002 .
<en> Four years later a civil war broke out , triggered by a group of demobilised soldiers .
<en> After the attack on President Ramos Horta on 11 February of this year , East Timor experienced yet another political crisis .
<en> A state of emergency was declared and a request made for the then 1 600-strong peacekeeping force to be reinforced .
<en> The political crisis in East Timor is accompanied by an economic one .
<en> Unemployment is in the order of 80 % , and 40 % of the unemployed are living below the poverty threshold .
<en> The country cannot be stabilised unless all the political forces reach a consensus on the fundamental functions of the state .
<en> We must condemn the brutal attack on the President and the Prime Minister and call upon the government of East Timor to put an end to violence , including the activities of gangs .
<en> The international community , notably the UN and the Security Council , must support the consolidation of democracy .
<en> It should also be remembered that East Timor urgently needs economic aid to combat poverty and develop administration and infrastructure .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I want to express my support for the joint motion for a resolution condemning the attacks .
<en> I also want to congratulate the institutions of East Timor for their calm response to the tragedy and I must underline , like Mrs Gomes and Mr Ribeiro e Castro , that East Timor is not a failed state .
<en> It is a state that requires international assistance , a delegation from the European Commission , the extension of the UN mission and support from all of us for any initiatives that might help to promote unity among the East Timorese people , with respect for the law and condemning all violence .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission has condemned the attacks against President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao in the strongest terms .
<en> The young democracy of East Timor is still extremely vulnerable in its political , judicial and security institutions .
<en> The country is confronted with poverty and high unemployment , especially among the young people who have so far little expectations for a prosperous future and are amenable to violent groups .
<en> In its meetings with the leaders of the country , the Commission has supported a peaceful settlement of the conflict , including the eventual disbanding and disarmament of any paramilitary group .
<en> Following the 2006 violence , the European Commission has reacted quickly : firstly , with humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced persons ; secondly , by supporting dialogue among the leaders ; and thirdly , in implementing a cash-for-work programme for unemployed youth .
<en> The European Commission also decided to open a fully-fledged delegation in Dili , and the new head of delegation is expected to start work in March 2008 .
<en> The delegation will become fully operational towards the second half of 2008 .
<en> This will create the opportunity for a formal political dialogue with the government and a faster assessment of support to the country .
<en> The strategy of the European Commission for East Timor under the 10th European Development Fund has recently been approved .
<en> It aims to support the still weak judicial sector , the Parliament and other institutions , thereby assisting in building up a democratic culture .
<en> Support to rural development will help to alleviate poverty and to improve infrastructure .
<en> Health-related activities will contribute to tackling poverty-related diseases and reducing alarmingly high mother and child mortality rates .
<en> Addressing the root causes of the present conflict and providing support for their solution will be as important as the longer term programmes .
<en> The East Timorese Government has submitted a comprehensive Governance Action Plan , which will be the subject of political dialogue between the delegation and the Government , supported by the Commission .
<en> In a mission during the next weeks , the Commission will assess the situation and the possibility of assisting with further measures addressing some of the root causes of the conflict .
<en> This may include requests of the Government to support some labour-intensive programmes to combat unemployment .
<en> In a joint Commission-Council paper of December 2007 , both the Commission and the EU Member States supported the central role of the United Nations in coordinating the assistance to the security sector .
<en> In summary , the envisaged support under the Commission programme , more than EUR 80 million , is comprehensive and will help to address many of the present problems of the country .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place at the end of the debates .

<en> The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Reino Paasilinna , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the European Institute of Innovation and Technology ( 15647 / 1 / 2007 - C6-0035 / 2008 - .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( FI ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , I want to thank you all for your excellent levels of cooperation .
<en> In our work that is always vital in order to achieve a good result .
<en> There has been talk about setting up an Institute of Innovation and Technology for almost three years now , and time has passed because the Commission 's original proposal has needed a good number of improvements made to it .
<en> Parliament 's committees , especially the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , have given the proposal a new look .
<en> Parliament and the Council have been guaranteed greater powers without , however , endangering the EIT 's autonomy .
<en> The election of its governing board is more closely reminiscent of the election system employed with the European Research Council , which the scientific world has commended .
<en> As someone just said , it has also been confirmed that small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to participate in the work of the EIT and enjoy its benefits .
<en> These are where the impact on employment will be greatest and it is precisely these which have the flexibility and efficiency needed for the swift implementation of innovations .
<en> Above all , it is the Institute 's priorities that have changed .
<en> The European Institute of Innovation and Technology , as its name suggests , is to focus on innovation .
<en> The two other elements in the knowledge triangle , education and research , are important , but innovation clearly represents the triangle 's apex ; it is its point of focus and its main objective .
<en> We will need to invest in quality education and basic research in the future but , as we all know , innovation is Europe 's Achilles heel .
<en> The Americans file over a third more patent applications with the European Patent Office than the Europeans themselves .
<en> We need more knowledge-intensive products and services .
<en> In 10 years China has increased its share of GNP spent on research and development from around zero to a current level of one and a half per cent .
<en> In as many as 17 EU Member States the share is lower than in China .
<en> The share of the EU 's GNP accounted for by investment in research and development is still significantly lower than that of the other world economic powers .
<en> More alarming still is the fact that here we have seen our share of investment decline , not rise , in recent years .
<en> More or less as bad is the state of venture capital .
<en> The Lisbon Strategy calls for a dynamic approach .
<en> Why do we not have faith in our own schemes ?
<en> High levels of education and research produce far too few commercial and functional applications , or at least they are put into effect less often than in competitor countries .
<en> Our patent system is also complicated .
<en> Should the brain drain not be a serious matter for a Union aiming to be the world 's leading knowledge-based economy ?
<en> The EIT will not eliminate these problems , but it may ease them through the example it sets .
<en> It will provide the business sector with a new kind of link to cooperation in education and research .
<en> It will create opportunities for the commercial exploitation of research , and it will establish closer bilateral ties .
<en> The EIT will not become a super university which keeps the best researchers for itself ; Parliament 's amendments guarantee that .
<en> After the initial problems which emerged with funding , the situation is now clear .
<en> One of the Knowledge and Innovation Communities I have proposed will concentrate on information and communications technology .
<en> We are already receiving significant amounts of money from the business world for it .
<en> Funding is therefore not a problem .
<en> Investigations and trials alone are not enough : we need cooperation , and for that purpose the EIT has been established .
<en> The excellent compromise reached with the Council is such a favourable one that we can state we are in favour of it , and I would therefore ask everyone to show their support for it in the vote which is to start soon .
<en> I thank you all .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am really happy - and that is not just a diplomatic phrase - to be here today to speak on the occasion of this opportunity to boost Europe 's innovations .
<en> I think that Parliament 's vote will be very important .
<en> As Mr Paasilinna mentioned , we have come a long way since the beginning , but I would just like to remind the House that there was a lot of scepticism , reluctance and hesitation about the proposal to boost innovation by such an establishment and I am glad that we have been able to shift these original positions into a consensual and supportive position on the part of Member States , Parliament , the Institutions and partners .
<en> I recall the efforts of the Finnish , then the German , Portuguese and now the Slovenian Presidencies .
<en> In particular I would like to express gratitude here to Parliament 's rapporteur , Mr Paasilinna , because he was very instrumental and supportive , and also to the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , Ms Niebler , as well as Mr Böge , the chairman of the Committee on Budgets , and the rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education , Ms Hennicot-Schoepges .
<en> Without these efforts and contributions we would not have been able to arrive at this moment .
<en> I think this is an opportunity to show that Europe has the capacity and also a strong commitment to improving its innovation capacity in the globalised world .
<en> Technological innovation is the key to growth , jobs and competitiveness , and this is the basis for the social wellbeing of our citizens .
<en> We are proposing to fully integrate the three sides of the knowledge triangle - education , research and innovation - by the cooperation of partners from business , research and academia .
<en> These will work together in so-called knowledge and innovation communities .
<en> I think that now is the time to set the European Institute of Innovation and Technology ( EIT ) into motion after all the preparations .
<en> We have already taken some steps , as you know , and I have informed the committee that we have launched a procedure for the identification of the governing board .
<en> There is a special high-calibre , independent identification committee which is now preparing criteria .
<en> We will then try to set up a group of 18 persons to start as the governing board .
<en> The identification committee works totally independently and autonomously .
<en> I think this is essential for the success of the EIT and the legitimacy of the governing board .
<en> Parliament and the Council will be kept fully informed of the selection procedure and the outcome .
<en> The Commission will draw up an interim report after completion of the first step of the selection procedure and a final report once the procedure is finished .
<en> Parliament and the Council will then have one month to take note of the proposed members of the EIT governing board .
<en> Their excellence , their undisputed reputation , total independence and ability to represent their interests from the sectors they represent - universities , research and business - will , I think , be an essential ingredient for the credibility of the Institute in the short and the long term .
<en> Allow me to underline an element of the utmost importance .
<en> I would like to formally state that the European Commission is fully committed to respecting the principles of the autonomy and independence of the board , which are enshrined in the regulation , and it will not have any role in the EIT 's strategic decision-making .
<en> On this basis the Commission will provide administrative and financial support to the board at its request and to the extent that is necessary in the kick-off stage .
<en> There must be some assistance at the beginning .
<en> Such support is intended to enable the board to select the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities ( KICs ) within the 18-month deadline and will in no way pre-empt its strategic decision-making .
<en> It is in our common interest to see the EIT operational within the timeframe foreseen in the regulation .
<en> I am really looking forward to the successful establishment of the EIT and once again I would like to express my deep gratitude for Parliament 's commitment and contribution .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( SL ) Three years have already passed since the idea of establishing a European Institute of Innovation and Technology was first aired .
<en> However , awareness of the fact that the key to greater competitiveness and innovation is appropriate care for the quality of human resources goes back much further .
<en> The EIT offers a solution to this problem at European level .
<en> The foundations are already in place .
<en> Now is the time for speedy and effective implementation of the agreed measures .
<en> I would like to thank the MEPs , the rapporteur and especially the members of my parliamentary group for enabling us to reach agreements and , in cooperation with the Commission and the Council , to prepare a good proposal containing most of our principal ideas .
<en> Innovation is at the heart of the EIT .
<en> Furthermore , our initiative has enabled the Institute to become a symbol of excellence and a recognisable mark of European quality .
<en> One great achievement is the network structure of independent Knowledge and Innovation Communities , mentioned in the current proposal .
<en> We have also been successful in finding a solution to the complex and complicated issue of the operational organisation of the Institute .
<en> The current proposal offers a solution in the form of a strategic innovation programme that optimises the balance between responsibility for policy and independence of the specialists , and clearly defines the competences for long-term strategic planning .
<en> We can do a lot with the financial resources mentioned earlier .
<en> The starting points are good , but effective implementation depends as usual on us and our will and persistence .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to apologise at the outset that I have to leave after my speech because I have to be at a meeting with President Pöttering .
<en> I should like to thank my colleague Mr Paasilinna most sincerely for his commitment to this matter , and also the Commissioner , who has always strongly supported this .
<en> I actually do believe that this EIT is an important European instrument .
<en> Mr Paasilinna has already stated this : we spend too little in Europe on research and development and we spend too little on excellence in research .
<en> In Europe as a whole , as in most countries - at least in most of the Member States - it could , should and must be more .
<en> The EIT is not exactly a competitive institution , but it should be driving this research , it should be creating new initiatives .
<en> I am thinking , for example , of how important it is in the energy sector alone that we make greater efforts in research to develop new energy technologies .
<en> Because it is so important , I would ask the Commissioner to insist that the necessary decisions are made quickly .
<en> One decision , of course , relates to the headquarters of the administrative office .
<en> As someone who hails from Vienna , and as an Austrian , I would naturally want the headquarters to be in Vienna .
<en> Whatever decision is made , however , it should be made quickly so that the EIT can start work soon .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my excellent Italian colleague Mr Albertini , which makes a number of recommendations to the players in this sector to improve a situation that is deteriorating because of growing demand for oil and diminishing oil reserves , increasingly congested towns and cities , and a negative impact on human health and climate change .
<en> I support the three chosen areas for combining public policy : encouraging technological developments ( cars with emissions of 125 g CO2 / km maximum ) , developing market-based instruments ( Emissions Trading Scheme , tax incentives , charges / fares based on environmental impact , etc . ) and using flanking measures to enable means of transport and infrastructure to be used as efficiently as possible .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , transport undoubtedly has an impact on society 's socio-economic condition and , at the same time , it has direct implications for the environment .
<en> Urban transport , in fact , generates 40 % of CO2 emissions and keeps Europe dependent on and ' hostage ' to the market in fossil fuels such as oil , which accounts for approximately 70 % of total demand .
<en> These alarming data are enough to explain the urgency and necessity of shaping a new comprehensive strategy for transport in Europe that could actually be developed from this report .
<en> Pollution caused by transport must be considerably reduced very quickly by placing restrictions on emissions of pollutants , altering the composition of fuel mixtures , and continuing to provide incentives for the purchase and use of environmentally-friendly and non-polluting forms of transport .
<en> The EU will therefore have responsibility for implementing an integrated plan to achieve this important objective , by committing itself to providing incentives for rail transport which , where appropriate improvements are made , can guarantee a high level of efficiency with a low environmental impact .
<en> The trans-European networks should be completed as soon as possible , and require greater financial support from the EU .
<en> On the other hand , Member States must guarantee and watch over the completion of this construction work , except in cases where damage to the environment or to health is proven .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Amendment 1 to the report on sustainable European transport policy tabled by the PPE-DE Group was a cause for justified concern - both for me and for the entire transport sphere .
<en> This amendment is aimed at delaying a review of the Eurovignette Directive .
<en> To accept this amendment would be to send a negative signal from the European Parliament and would contradict the report by the European Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety of 28 January 2008 .
<en> This is why I voted against the amendment and against the entire content of the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of this report on sustainable transport policy .
<en> It takes account of European energy and environment policies .
<en> In the EU 70 % of demand for oil is attributable to the transport sector .
<en> We need to put an end to our almost total dependence on fossil fuels by combining the various policies that encompass all modes of transport .
<en> This approach should create the conditions essential for realism , such as technological innovation to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and the development of biofuels , the reform of the taxation system to take account of environmental impact , and accompanying measures to make better use of infrastructure and encourage citizens to change their habits .
<en> Every citizen can be a player in sustainable transport by using public transport in preference to passenger cars , where this alternative is possible .
<en> To make passenger and freight transport easier using low-emission modes of transport such as rail , river , sea and public transport , a range of new services , more competitive organisation of the sector and different ways of using certain infrastructure are needed simultaneously .
<sp>
<2en> Since it is impossible to comment in this explanation of vote on all the important issues raised by this EP own initiative report , given its complexity and breadth , it is notable that the document does not address or incorrectly addresses aspects that researchers regard as essential in addressing issues of transport and energy and their impact on the environment .
<2en> For example :
<2en> there is no mention of high oil prices or to the consequences thereof ;
<2en> there is no mention of the use of methane in road transport ( in the form of CNG , LNG or biomethane ) ;
<2en> there is a lack of clarity on the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel for road transport ;
<2en> the uncritical bias towards the use of biofuels , with their serious consequences that have already been widely demonstrated ;
<2en> there is no reference to documents such as the ' Target 2020 ' programme advocating the replacement by 2020 of approximately 20 % of the petrol and diesel consumed within the European transport sector .
<2en> Finally , I must point out that , in addition to listing problems already clearly identified , we need policies to respond effectively to those problems , such as challenging the current capitalist globalisation and the role of transport within that framework , in particular the increasing geographical distance between the point of production and the point of consumption , and the consequent rise in transport needs .
<2en> There is much more to be said on all of this ...

<en> ( RO ) The common agricultural policy is one of the pillars of European development and the debates on the methods of improvement of this policy should be a constant , not only for the European institutions , but also within the Member States in the communities that elected us .
<en> I am glad that by means of the Commission Communication and the report drafted by my colleague Goepel we have identified several solutions to enhance the common agricultural policy and to make the people in rural areas believe that this policy is for their own good and not only a set of bureaucratic provisions drafted by some offices in Brussels .
<en> However , we must be sure that the proposals made by the Commission , the Council and us are flexible and realistic enough to be efficient when implemented .
<en> Romania , the country that I represent in the European Parliament , accounts for 25 % of the work force in agriculture and 40 % of its population lives in the rural areas .
<en> These are figures which demonstrate the importance of agriculture and rural areas for Romania and our economy .
<en> The solutions that we find for the CAP reform must take account of such cases as Romania , with a large agricultural sector in a full process of modernisation .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like , first of all , to welcome the report by Mr Goepel and thank him for his hard work and that of all the people involved in this .
<en> This is only the beginning of the process as we look to the future of the common agricultural policy during this year .
<en> This is a very important step in this process and we now look forward to the Commission proposals in the near future .
<en> The position of the second pillar of rural development and what level of modulation is set will certainly be central , I believe , to the long-term success or otherwise of the future of the common agricultural policy .
<en> But I have to say that never has it been more important to ensure a level playing field throughout the Member States , and we cannot allow different levels of percentages among the Member States .
<en> Decoupling has , to a large extent , been successful .
<en> I do not think we can go back on that .
<en> Cross-compliance has been unhelpful and bureaucratic and can be improved .
<en> And food security must be at the top of the list .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , solutions to increasingly serious problems are being demanded of the common agricultural policy and the structural policy that supports it .
<en> The fundamental shape of the common agricultural policy for the years 2007-2013 that was adopted by the ministers of agriculture of the EU countries on 26 June 2003 in Luxembourg includes some solutions that benefit Poland .
<en> Others , however , do more to protect the interests of the old Member States .
<en> I share the rapporteur 's view that the Commission should draw up a detailed report relating to such problems as the additional costs borne by farmers in respect of observance of Community norms in the sphere of environmental protection , animal welfare and food security .
<en> In taking a position on the report that has been presented to us , I agree that it is necessary to continue the process of reforms and further development of rural areas .
<en> The common agricultural policy must change if it is to find answers to new challenges such as climate change , increasing energy demands , world population increases and the increasing degree of openness to world markets .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I welcome the Goepel report because the time is finally ripe for abolishing or thoroughly reforming instruments such as quota control , livestock premiums , export refunds and intervention prices .
<en> Looking at the global increase in demand for foodstuffs , a greater market economy in agricultural policy also offers more opportunities in European agriculture .
<en> I am anxious about the wording of some of the compromises .
<en> The talk here is of headage premiums being decoupled for now , sector-related systems of protection are being demanded and a whole series of derogations - on milk , for instance - are to be funded via the first pillar .
<en> This all runs the risk of us hanging on to the old market regulations via the back door .
<en> We must really limit exceptions to structurally weak regions and define them for very tightly limited production quantities .
<en> If we are too generous here it will lead to distortions of competition that we are not able to calculate in political terms .
<en> I therefore encourage the Commission to give the market a proper chance in the upcoming legislative proposals .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , there are a number of references in this report to the WTO .
<en> However , I have real concerns that , while we debate this report on the CAP in Parliament this afternoon , the future of European agriculture is being threatened and seriously undermined by the negotiations being undertaken in our name by Commissioner Mandelson at the WTO talks .
<en> The report calls for the concept of qualified market access to be pursued in WTO negotiations .
<en> Is Commissioner Fischer Boel satisfied that we are pursuing that line ?
<en> Indeed , is Commissioner Fischer Boel confident that the line being taken by Commissioner Mandelson will not undermine the beef , dairy and other sectors and , in some ways at least , render our debate here this afternoon irrelevant ?
<en> The report calls for European non-trade concerns to be central in WTO talks .
<en> Is the Commissioner satisfied we are pursuing that line , or are we just having a very polite debate in Parliament this afternoon , while Mr Mandelson is attacking the very foundations of the CAP ?

<en> author . - Mr President , Armenia is essentially a relatively recently re-born country , struggling to strengthen its democratic institutions and safeguard the well-being of its citizens whilst squashed between two not-so-democratic but rather hostile neighbours , namely Russia and Turkey , and whilst being disturbingly and unfairly involved in a territorial conflict with the totalitarian regime of Azerbaijan .
<en> In this setting , the recently-held presidential elections were not perfect , but in the words of the international observation mission , were ' administered mostly in line with OSCE and Council of Europe [ ... ] standards ' .
<en> Sadly , in post-election protests it would appear that the police used more than necessary force , which resulted in the death of eight people , including one policeman .
<en> A thorough and fair investigation is called for into the events that led to these deaths .
<en> An investigation is also warranted into allegations that external forces are instigating violence in Armenia in order to destabilise the country .
<en> I call for full support for this resolution .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( PL ) Mr President , it goes without saying that we would like Armenia to be at peace , to have secure borders and to manage its external affairs successfully .
<en> May I remind you that the elections in Armenia gave rise to no serious protests .
<en> What is happening there today must be seen in the specific context of the Caucasus , a highly inflammable region .
<en> While I have the floor , Mr President , I would , with your permission , take this opportunity to voice my outrage at the news I have just received of the murder of Faraj Rahho , the Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul .
<en> He was abducted on 29 February and three of his bodyguards were shot .
<en> This is a further attack , a further crime , by men who lack the courage to show their faces to the world , who kidnap innocent victims , ordinary people pursuing religious activities - mostly Christians , mostly Catholic Christians .
<en> Today we are again witnesses of such a crime , and it seems to me this matter should be placed on the agenda of our next meeting in Brussels as a special item .
<en> May the Lord grant eternal rest to the heroic martyr who died today in Mosul .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE group . - ( RO ) What happened in Armenia must be vehemently condemned but unfortunately it was not a surprise .
<en> There are other quite similar events in another country in that area and they represent a continuation of the situation in place after 1990 .
<en> We are facing the consequence of several factors persisting from then to the present day : insufficient economic development , latent conflicts , and the influence of the Russian Federation .
<en> On top of all that we have the situation in Kosovo which , despite all considerable but useless efforts of the authors , will form a precedent for all those interested .
<en> For the population in the region , it can only result in insecurity , lack of confidence in the authorities , and vulnerability to manipulation .
<en> There is only one solution to restore a state of normality : economic development that will generate a higher standard of living .
<en> There are energy resources .
<en> The development of such resources and of their transit will solve the problem of economic development , as well as that of independence from the Russian Federation and it will also solve Europe 's problem in general .
<en> The European Union did not really take a stand and if we want to find solutions to the problems in the Southern Caucasus , the Union must take active steps in the development of energy routes in the Black Sea region .
<sp>
<2en> When a country that participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy and is favourably disposed towards the EU holds a successful democratic election , it is a victory for us as well .
<2en> If it goes wrong , it is a case of mutual defeat .
<2en> The Presidential election in Armenia was conducted in line with international standards , according to the international observation mission .
<2en> Alas , subsequent developments cancel this unsteady step forward .
<2en> Bloodshed and the imposition of a state of emergency have swept Armenia off the road to democracy , impeding its relations with the European Union .
<2en> Human rights are suppressed in Armenia and there is no freedom of speech .
<2en> Yerevan should lift the state of emergency entirely and the OSCE representative should assist in finding a solution to the crisis .
<2en> Hopefully , both negotiating parties will show moderation and will base their work on European values .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the present political crisis in Armenia is not the first .
<en> During the presidency of Levon Ter-Petrosian the country began to depart sharply from liberal and democratic standards .
<en> The main opposition parties were banned , freedom of the press was restricted , and parliamentary elections were generally recognised as not meeting all democratic criteria .
<en> Mr Ter-Petrosian resigned as president under the pressure of demonstrations .
<en> That brought some stability to the country , but it was ended by the dramatic murder in parliament of nine leading Armenian politicians , including the prime minister , by unknown assassins .
<en> We are now seeing a repeat of what happened some 10 years ago .
<en> The present crisis , however , may perhaps be due to the weariness of Armenian society with the governments of the so-called Karabakh Clan , to which both the former and the present president belong .
<en> The government is widely accused of restoring authoritarian rule under the guise of democracy , with mafia-type control of business activities and a deteriorating economy .
<en> There is also a growing fear of Armenia 's increasing isolation and the gradual weakening of its position in the unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh .
<en> When Mr Ter-Petrosian decided to return to politics and stand for election , his promise of greater flexibility in foreign policy won him considerable support .
<en> The present crisis is very deep , however .
<en> Let us hope it will be resolved by political means , although that is not at all certain .
<en> If not , the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh may be stepped up in an attempt to unite society around the government .
<en> A recent incident in Karabakh in which 11 people died confirms this fear .
<en> Another result may be a further strengthening of Armenia 's increasing dependence on Russia .
<en> The recent inauguration of the Armenia-Iran pipeline will not weaken that dependence , since the gas , and the pipeline itself , will of course be controlled by Gazprom .
<en> Our attitude to the serious situation in Armenia should be friendly , but we should not refrain from criticism or from expressing concern where necessary .
<en> I believe the position proposed in this resolution meets those criteria .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( PT ) I should like to begin by paying tribute to the commitment of the rapporteur , Mrs Attwooll , in drawing up a balanced report on a question as fundamental as the sovereignty of Member States in the management of their fisheries resources and the setting up of private property rights for access to and exploitation of that public good .
<en> However , although we appreciate paragraph 11 , the report contains many points on which we totally disagree , for example , viewing this debate as an anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy or including points that more or less explicitly argue for adopting fishing right management mechanisms at Community level .
<en> In our view , each Member State should be responsible for managing its marine resources , in particular as a way of safeguarding its food sovereignty .
<en> We therefore reject any step-by-step process that could , in future , lead to the setting up of a rights-based management system in Community fisheries , that is the marketing of fishing licences , days at sea or quotas , which would inevitably lead to the appropriation and concentration in private hands of a public good .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , this is a complex area and I certainly commend Ms Attwooll for her report and her efforts in that regard .
<en> Representing a region whose overall experience of the common fisheries policy has been far from positive , I must say that my natural inclination is strongly against the imposition of any EU-based management system .
<en> Rather , I am quite clear that Member States should be able to decide what management system works best for them .
<en> Moreover , maintaining stability , I fear , could be severely jeopardised in the industry if unregulated transferable quotas were embraced , with particular threat to single and small-scale operators .
<en> It would be better by far in my book to repatriate real powers over fishing to Member States and concentrate on getting in place viable local management systems capable of enjoying the confidence of those affected .
<en> I also fear that this new study will prove to be another protracted excuse for putting off real and helpful change .
<en> I hope that does not prove to be so , but we have seen that in the past .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Attwooll , and to say that , in my opinion , the natural marine heritage should be preserved and should be used in a sustainable manner by the fishing communities whose lives are traditionally bound up with that environment ; it cannot be regarded as just another business .
<en> I therefore do not share the vision of marine ecosystems and the associated fishing communities as a market , where fishing rights may be freely traded , perhaps even on a kind of stock market , which would naturally lead to the industrialisation of fishing and pose a threat to the equilibrium of the ecosystems and fishing communities .
<en> Even more , it seems to me that we simply must not allow anything to jeopardise the principle of relative stability and I therefore think that the Commission should be as cautious as possible in this debate .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to thank Ms Attwooll for her work and welcome this report as it has initiated a much-needed debate on alternative management measures .
<en> I strongly agree with the report when it points out that the current fisheries management systems within the EU , specifically in the area of TACs and quotas , do not provide an answer to our problems , and that it is necessary to hold a wide-ranging debate .
<en> In its green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy , the Commission states that : ' Alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management . '
<en> However , I would venture to suggest that alternative management measures should and must play a compulsory role in the future , as we need to take on board a range of factors , including climate change and up-to-date marine and fisheries research based on sound science .
<en> As I pointed out in my now redundant opinion of the Committee on Fisheries for the report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change , I have no doubt that climate change will impact on EU fisheries regulations , as allocations of quotas based on historic catch patterns will need to be revised as a result of the shifting distribution of fish stocks .
<en> Furthermore , fisheries management will have to be increasingly based on adaptive approaches as historical data will be less valuable .
<en> As climate change and other factors increasingly impact on our fish stocks , our management will need the necessary flexibility , based on sound peer-reviewed science , to adapt to the new conditions and ensure sustainability of resources .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I think that we all share a common objective : that of achieving a balance between the economic efficiency of such systems but , at the same time , protecting small fisheries .
<en> I agree with what the rapporteur said , namely that fisheries cannot be looked at purely in economic terms .
<en> I need to stress here that the subject is far from simple .
<en> I certainly agree that such systems are a complex matter .
<en> As I said before , we have to take into account in our reflections possible limitations on the concentration of rights , the resolution of allocation issues and measures for the protection of artisanal fisheries , and we have to approach this matter gradually .
<en> In the short term , we need to learn more , we need to identify best practices and we need to study where rights-based managements systems have operated successfully in certain Member States and look at experiences in third countries .
<en> All this will clearly be an important issue for discussion in the context of the next reform .
<en> I certainly look forward to the input from the Committee on Fisheries on this issue .
<en> I have noted all the comments made by all the parliamentarians who have spoken on this subject .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - Madam President , I cannot say that I am altogether reassured by the Commissioner 's response , because it seemed to me that , in what he was saying , he was actually giving pre-eminence to one particular form of rights-based management , whereas what the report is seeking is a review of all different types of forms to assess their merits and demerits .
<en> I think we are all agreed that the common fisheries policy is in need of reform .
<en> A newspaper in my constituency that picked up the European Parliament press release on the report cites me as being cautious about the reform of the CFP .
<en> This is certainly not so if it is taken to mean that I have any doubts about the need for reform .
<en> I am cautious , as I think we all are , to the extent of wanting to be reassured that the reform is in the right direction .
<en> In the course of writing the report , for example , it occurred to me to ask just how compatible with one another the different ways of defining the extent of the right to fish are .
<en> My feeling was that , whilst quota and effort limitations both combine readily with territorial restrictions , neither of the first two sits that comfortably with the other .
<en> This in turn made me realise that , technical though a report on rights-based management might , on the face of it , seem , the issue it raises goes to the very heart of the common fisheries policy .
<en> Whilst generally applauding the direction of current reform , I hope that the discussion may trigger a more radical reappraisal of the tools we use , so as to achieve the best possible balance between improving the livelihood of those engaged in fisheries , having a sustainable marine ecology in which fish stocks are conserved and maintaining the viability of fisheries-dependent communities .
<en> I would not like to think that , in advance of a thorough study , some prior decision had been taken as to what might achieve the very best balance .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Madam President , very briefly , two days ago we adopted a policy action at EU level on organ donation and transplantation .
<en> I thought this was important enough to include it in this motion for a resolution with a suitable short reference as indicated in the voting papers .
<en> ( The oral amendment was not accepted )
<en> - Before the vote on paragraph 37 :
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am asking for the three words ' independent impact assessment ' to be included after ' better regulation ' .
<en> That was the wording in the original draft but , for reasons I am unaware of , it seems to have fallen by the wayside .
<en> As far as I can determine , the oral amendment has the approval of the other groups .
<en> ( The oral amendment was accepted )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I voted against the report , as some of the outcomes of the vote are incompatible with my own ethical and moral views .
<2en> Furthermore , I cannot understand why only marginal approaches exist for research in agriculture and forestry even though it is vital , for the future of agriculture and forestry , to set the necessary research priorities in this area in particular .
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) This report is completely in line with the policy of the European institutions , where it emphasises aid to employers under the pretext of research and where it aims to strengthen the link between research and private interests , even if it sometimes cloaks this link in ecological or regionalist attire , according to fashion .
<2en> Nor is this report free of concessions to certain obscurantist ideas , whether religious or otherwise .
<2en> As for the budget for the Sixth Framework Programme , this penalises , in financial terms , research units whose work has been judged not to be a priority as it has little potential for profitable use by the private sector in the short or medium term .
<2en> The only reason we have voted in favour of this report is that we do not want to prejudice certain research strands supported by the report , which are seeking to make scientific , medical or technological progress , and nor do we want to risk depriving researchers in the public sector of the funding they need .
<2en> We have also adopted all the amendments that could represent progress in relation to the current situation .
<sp>
<2en> ( PT ) Despite the efforts of the rapporteur and most of the members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , there is no guarantee that there will be no discrimination against countries and regions whose business structure does not have the economic ability to take part in programmes aiming at the rapid transfer of knowledge in technological innovation , even though there may be scientific resources .
<2en> Thus the efforts to ensure cohesion enshrined in the Treaty will not be enough to combat the loss of competitiveness that this will entail .
<2en> The assumption behind the aims of the Lisbon strategy was full employment and exclusion , and not the opposite .
<2en> Without being able to share in knowledge and take part in programmes , the less favoured regions will be left a long way from economic and social convergence .
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) I voted in favour of this report .
<2en> I am a long-time supporter of research work at European level .
<2en> I am also pleased by Parliament ' s stated desire to create and develop this interdisciplinary Community area .
<2en> In France , in particular , we are seeing a worrying drop in the number of researchers .
<2en> As a result of disappointing national policies , the most talented researchers often go abroad and only too rarely return .
<2en> The measure included in this report on the mobility of researchers and assistance with returning home will also , I hope , help to compensate for the shortcomings of some governments .
<2en> Stimulating research also means ensuring an independent training policy based on existing competences at European level .
<2en> Although the task of the legislator may be to provide a framework for research , there is a risk that this will be too restricted .
<2en> A Europe of discovery must also be fostered and work on biotechnologies , which represent the future , should be encouraged .
<2en> Similarly , the fundamental European research at the heart of the competitiveness of our industries and the substantial work undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises and industries , whose input we know to be necessary to discovery and innovation , must also be supported .
<2en> Research also affects the everyday life of all Europeans and priority areas , such as food safety , the fight against the major serious diseases and improving public health , show the desire to associate research and wellbeing .
<2en> I am also pleased to note the support that is proposed for the development of research into childhood illnesses , a field in which national policies have often failed .
<2en> That is why I call on the Commission to publish proposals on paediatric medicines .
<sp>
<2en> Research and development are of crucial importance if Europe is to become a continent characterised by economic growth and sound welfare .
<2en> International competition , especially from the United States , increases the need for new and intensified research efforts .
<2en> In its proposal in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme , the Commission has identified several important problems and research areas which Europe needs to concentrate on .
<2en> Obviously , it is important that Europe ' s researchers cooperate and that research efforts are coordinated to some degree .
<2en> It is also very important that we should not only make it easier for researchers to travel but also facilitate the distribution of research results .
<2en> What worries us is that the framework programme involves a very considerable centralisation of research .
<2en> Major resources are being invested in a small number of selected areas .
<2en> Research is thus being directed in an unfortunate way because the Member States ' own research routes will be governed by the Commission ' s priorities .
<2en> For small countries with limited research budgets , the EU is thus in danger of becoming one of the main bodies that funds research , something which would give rise to an unfortunate degree of centralisation .
<2en> As liberals , we applaud the principle of independent research .
<2en> From the point of view of efficiency , independent research has shown itself to be far superior to politically directed research .
<2en> In the long run , societies which provide researchers with large room for manoeuvre when it comes to choosing subjects and methods achieve better results than societies in which the politicians determine the direction to be taken by research .
<2en> The principle of the independent pursuit of knowledge has , for centuries , strongly characterised research in Europe .
<2en> Universities and other institutions of higher learning have an important role to play in cooperating with industry and the public sector , but their most important task must not become that of taking orders from the latter .
<2en> We believe that the Sixth Framework Programme would give rise to undue centralisation of independent research .
<2en> We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting on the Caudron report .
<chp>

<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Bearing in mind that the European Community , in its negotiations with the Association of South East Asian Nations with a view to concluding a second-generation free-trade agreement , should give priority to the multilateral trade system established by the World Trade Organisation , it is a matter of importance that ASEAN covers a widely varying area : one of the countries is among the least-developed nations , whereas others are highly developed .
<en> This is the main reason why these inequalities are playing an important role in finalising a free-trade agreement .
<en> During the process of concluding free-trade agreements , one priority matter is the signing of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement containing enforceable human rights clauses , as human rights and democracy are fundamental EU values .
<en> Attention must be paid to the consequences of the agreement for the small-scale farmers of the region and to monitoring and ensuring that family and sustainable agriculture are reinforced .
<en> Local authorities should also be sensitised to the fight against climate change by combating deforestation and by enhancing tropical forests .
<en> Trade in biofuels should therefore be restricted solely to those biofuels that do not disturb the equilibrium of the environment .
<en> The importance of ongoing cooperation on counter-terrorism and crisis / disaster management should also be stressed .
<en> An EU-ASEAN framework agreement could help to encourage future industrial growth in the EU , but should be based on the principle of transparency and on rules for competition and investment , intellectual property rights and state aid .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , many economists are pointing out that the South Asian region has the potential to become a world economic centre in the future .
<en> This is a dangerous trend , especially for Europe , which could lose a significant proportion of world trade .
<en> In Europe , meanwhile , we keep on tightening up conditions for companies and agriculture and trading with countries that do not even respect copyright law .
<en> In the light of this , can we talk of free and fair competition ?
<en> Of course , we must strive to support respect for human rights in Asiatic countries , but we must not do this while handing over European markets to goods that are manufactured under conditions that do not meet European competition standards .
<en> At the moment we are concentrating strongly on economic competition within the EU .
<en> Here we are making a mistake as well as acting foolishly .
<en> Meanwhile , Asia is subduing us economically , just as Europe subdued Asia militarily and politically in the past .

<en> On the Florenz report , I should state that Amendments 5 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 and 15 are inadmissible for this report .
<en> However , they may be tabled when we deal with the main report .
<en> I have received a number of e-mails on this issue .
<en> All the services and the Legal Service have looked at this in detail and have concluded that these amendments are inadmissible for this report .
<en> They are , however , admissible for the final report .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I must say that I am able to accept this argumentation for all amendments with the exception of 15 .
<en> I do not know why 15 is not acceptable for voting just now .
<sp>
<en> Mr Březina , the answer which I have received - and I have received an e-mail about this specific amendment - was the same as for all these particular amendments .
<en> I have to rely on that .
<en> Amendment 15 may be tabled for the main report , however , so it could become part of the main report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the European Parliament 's resolution on the natural disaster in China .
<2en> Earthquakes are catastrophic events that claim very many lives and cause huge damage to property .
<2en> The Chinese earthquake , which had a magnitude of 7.8 , has shocked people all over the world .
<2en> This devastating quake has claimed a large number of victims and has created extremely difficult conditions for those who have been affected by it , especially in Sichuan Province .
<2en> I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the Chinese people and with the great many victims of this tragedy .
<2en> We welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities reacted swiftly to the disaster by providing emergency relief measures .
<2en> It should be noted that China was also willing to accept offers of aid from external sources .
<2en> Moreover , it is gratifying to see that the Chinese and foreign media were allowed to transmit detailed and accurate information on the disaster .
<2en> According to my estimates , the EU has already provided more than EUR 10 million in aid .
<2en> However , China needs the practical experience of Europeans in this field even more than it needs financial aid .
<2en> The emergency relief measures provided for the civilian population must therefore include tried and tested practices for reducing the impact of events of this kind .
<2en> The EU has to make available the knowledge it has acquired from seismology research so as to help identify the reasons for the inadequate structural stability of buildings .
<2en> The earthquake region of Sichuan must be converted into an open-air laboratory where potential solutions can be tested out and the findings used for the reconstruction of that province .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) A ban on this type of weapon must be implemented on a global basis , through the United Nations , and at the instigation of nation states , not by the European Parliament .
<en> We are opposed to a common European security policy which will lead to a United States of Europe .
<en> We have therefore voted against the resolution .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Being fully aware of the retrospective nature of the resolution , we voted in favour , mainly because of the content of paragraphs 7 and 8 , which :
<en> Reiterate the call for all EU Member States and NATO countries to impose a ban on the use of depleted uranium , to redouble efforts to achieve a complete ban and systematically to halt production and procurement of this type of weaponry ;
<en> Call on the Member States and the Council to take the lead in working towards an international treaty to establish a ban on the development , production , stockpiling , transfer , testing and use of uranium weapons as well as the destruction or recycling of existing stocks ( even though the EP has unacceptably set conditions on that requirement ) .
<en> However , we must stress that the majority in the EP has avoided attributing responsibility for the use of depleted uranium for military purposes .
<en> In other words , it seeks to whitewash the crimes committed by NATO and the USA and its allies in Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq ( where furthermore , besides depleted uranium weapons , fragmentation or white phosphorus bombs have also been used ) .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I fully support calls for the establishment of an international treaty to ban depleted uranium weapons .
<en> The use of these weapons causes fatal diseases amongst both military personnel and the civilian population .
<en> The EU has a moral duty to take a lead on this issue and work towards the total elimination of these weapons .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - EU Member States and the Council must take the lead in negotiating an international treaty aimed at introducing a ban on the development , production , stockpiling , transfer , testing and use of uranium weapons .
<en> Indeed , I feel that the treaty must not stop there .
<en> States must not be given the opportunity to continue using old stocks of these weapons whose impact on health and the environment remains , in my view , uncertain .
<en> Existing stocks must be destroyed or recycled .
<en> I voted in favour of this resolution .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) In recent decades , European rural areas have been increasingly abandoned , a trend which has been accompanied by a gradual ageing of the population .
<en> This ageing of the agricultural population is worrying for the future of European agriculture .
<en> That is why I consider the Veraldi report to be very important as it looks at various aspects connected with the expectations and opportunities of young farmers who have a key role to play in the sustainable development of European rural areas .
<en> I believe that young farmers are particularly important to the development of a dynamic agricultural sector in order to achieve the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
<en> Under the new common agricultural policy , the generational change must therefore be regarded as one of the priorities .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) We should welcome the fact that by a large majority , the House has adopted the report on the future of young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy .
<en> The statements on increasing European Union aid for young farmers are particularly significant .
<en> One of these statements is a declaration concerning easier access to preferential loans for this group of farmers .
<en> Further practical aid is essential in terms of creating real opportunities for young farmers wishing to continue the family tradition in the Lesser Poland Voivodship to obtain a reasonable income .
<en> If the promised aid has the desired effect , the situation whereby villages in Lesser Poland are inhabited solely by older people caring for their grandchildren whose parents feel that the only opportunity open to them is to seek work abroad may become less common .
<en> This report therefore has a social dimension as well as an economic one .
<en> Young farmers wish to preserve traditions , but they also understand that if they do not draw on other experiences and technology they will be unable to transform their family farms into modern , competitive and profitable enterprises .
<en> Support for the development of modern methods and agricultural production tools is therefore a particularly important feature of the resolution adopted today .
<sp>
<2en> As usual , we in Junilistan note that in this case it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision on the EU 's agricultural policy because , if it had , the Union would be caught in a trap of protectionism and heavy subsidies to various groups in the farming industry .
<2en> This own-initiative report contains a number of absurd proposals , such as yet another ' European Year ' , this time for ' urban-rural dialogue ' .
<2en> If every European Year proposed by the European Parliament were to become a reality , every year from now to the end of the century would probably be booked up in advance .
<2en> The affirmation in paragraph 35 that rural development measures should be aimed directly at farmers strengthens Junilistan 's impression that the old , overburdened ' common agricultural policy ' has now merely changed its name to ' rural development ' in the EU budget .
<2en> It is with disquiet that we note that the European Parliament now calls for the recognition of non-trade concerns as import criteria in the WTO context .
<2en> We consider that to be nothing more than a preliminary to the introduction of barriers to trade and protectionism against the rest of the world .
<2en> I have therefore chosen to vote against the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Veraldi report on the future of young farmers highlights a number of important issues which are of relevance across the EU 's rural areas .
<en> The report also recognises that farming methods rooted in specific geographical areas and cultural traditions in Europe should be conserved , improved and promoted .
<en> I wholeheartedly endorse those sentiments and consider that they can be applied across the EU 's workload .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of this report , as I consider that the measures stipulated therein are complementary to the national programmes in this field .
<en> The National Programme for Rural Development of Romania provides a measure that offers grants from the rural development funds of the European Union of up to EURO 40.000 per person .
<en> Yet , there are difficult conditions to be fulfilled and , consequently , we still have a small number of requests in this regard .
<en> The report we are adopting today provides for a series of significant measures , both in terms of the financial support of young farmers , and in terms of certain essential legal aspects , like the facilitation of succession upon agricultural property or easy access to bank credits .
<en> The professional education and training component offered to young people in rural areas is also important .
<en> Thus , I consider that future legislation should provide for the huge disproportion between the younger population aged 35 , active in the agricultural sector ( only 8,5 % of the total number of farmers in Europe ) and the other age categories in this field .
<en> These measures will definitely contribute to the success of the national programmes , as is the major axis of supporting the young farmers , stipulated by PNDR of Romania .

<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I abstained from voting on the introduction of the single currency in Slovakia on 1 January 2009 , because I have doubts about whether Slovakia 's currency policy is free of manipulation .
<en> Furthermore , given the current uncertainty about the future of the European Union after the outcome of the Irish referendum , I think it would be appropriate to first analyse the causes and not to continue with the currency policy integration process as if nothing had happened .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I am voting in favour of Mr Casa 's report on the adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009 .
<en> The rapporteur has presented a very good and solid report .
<en> We must agree that the creation of the euro area is a success along the path towards deepening European integration .
<en> Therefore , further enlargements of this area are necessary and it is pleasing that another country will soon be joining this circle .
<en> I would also like to mention that with every enlargement of the euro area we should make sure that there is social support for this European project , and we should also make sure that these enlargements point towards a reinforcement of common European economic policy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I agree with the rapporteur that significant disparities occur within individual regions and that analyses serving as a basis for the division of Union money should take this problem into account .
<2en> It is clearly visible in the new Member States .
<2en> In Poland , for example , the most important social division affecting Poles is the growing gulf in their affluence .
<2en> Currently as much as 12 % of the population is living in extreme poverty .
<2en> The greatest differences continue to be between the town and the country .
<2en> Although Małopolska is ranked fourth in the country in terms of GDP , unemployment is a problem there - and it mainly affects the rural populace .
<2en> In the neighbouring Świętokrzyskie province , country dwellers account for 55.5 % of the unemployed ( 88 % of them are unemployed and have no benefit rights ) .
<2en> The prolongation of such situations means that these people 's chance of overcoming the ' social exclusion ' that has been discussed so extensively during the current parliamentary session is dwindling .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) The Moderate Delegation in the European Parliament has today voted against the own-initiative report of Gábor Harangozós ( PSE , HU ) on the impact of cohesion policy on the integration of vulnerable communities and groups .
<en> We do not think that cohesion will be strengthened by the definition of further vulnerable groups in society or by establishing further statistical categories .
<en> On the contrary , we think that the formulation of distribution policy is a national responsibility .
<en> Moreover , the European Parliament should not at this stage call for an extension of support after 2013 , since that would be to disregard the results of the policy .
<sp>
<2en> I regret that proposals contained in my opinion that we put forward in plenary and that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted , particularly on the need to revise the CAP to reverse the objectives of its previous reforms .
<2en> They have been responsible for loss of income for small and medium-sized farmers , absenteeism and the abandonment of agricultural activity , favouring large landowners only .
<2en> I also regret that not enough importance has been given to the continuing provision of high-quality public services in rural areas ( including in mountain and extremely remote areas ) in order to combat isolation and to provide universal access to education , healthcare , transport and communications , culture and a decent life for farmers and their families .
<2en> Lastly , I am also disappointed that there is no inclusion in the final resolution of the need to boost support for farmers ' associations , cooperatives , wine cooperatives and other local institutions in the field of crafts and other activities that are complementary to farming so as to facilitate the marketing of products , the creation of local markets and closer links between producers and consumers .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , for the sheep farmers of my country , Cyprus , the main problem for the last year has been the confusing and , as it transpired , apparently false results relating to foot-and-mouth-disease diagnosis which were supplied by an animal disease reference laboratory in the UK .
<en> This animal disease laboratory is used by the Commission as a reference laboratory .
<en> The results it supplied led to thousands of animals being killed and to a catastrophe for many sheep farmers on the island .
<en> This laboratory , I note , is the same place from where the virus escaped a few months earlier , causing an outbreak in the UK with devastating results for the farmers there .
<en> May I call on the Commission to take a second , more critical , look at the standards of the animal disease reference laboratories it uses , in order to make sure that their scientific credibility is of the required highest level ?
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , I am sorry to have to say that the report by Mr Aylward is actually more about rescuing the sheep and goat sector in Europe than about ensuring its future .
<en> We hardly noticed when sheep and goats , like horses , practically disappeared from our landscape .
<en> No longer do we hear the sound of bells or barking dogs .
<en> Products derived from local raw materials are disappearing too .
<en> I am referring to products such as milk , meat , wool and leather .
<en> I believe that there is still a chance of saving the breeding of these animals , at least in certain areas .
<en> If we fail to implement at least the measures proposed by the rapporteur , zoos will be the only place where will be able to see these creatures in future .
<en> If production is not profitable , we can of course buy in supplies from New Zealand , Australia and other countries .
<en> We should , however , strive to save our own fauna , of which sheep and goats are a part .
<en> It is important to bear that in mind .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it seems that all of us here this evening come from regions where pasture farming exists and there is a keen interest in the sheep and goat sector .
<en> For this reason I need to - and certainly shall - inform my colleagues Mrs Fischer Boel and Mrs Androulla Vassiliou of everything that has been said in this House and all the requests made by Members .
<en> Mrs McGuinness , I fully understand Parliament 's position on the sensitive issue of tagging .
<en> I shall , as I said , inform the Commissioner responsible of the view expressed by several Members this evening .
<en> I do understand Parliament 's concerns , and I hope that together with Commissioner Fischer Boel we can find a positive solution .
<en> I believe and trust that , once the debate in Parliament and the Council is completed , the Health Check will provide an adequate response to many of the concerns raised by the rapporteur and raised during this debate by many Members regarding the future of the sheep and goat sector .
<en> Solutions to some of the questions could be at hand in the near future .
<en> We are working towards an agreement on the agricultural aspects of the Doha Development Agenda , which should be finalised before the summer break .
<en> This should shed more light on the question the rapporteur has raised about sensitive products .
<en> As concerns promotion , we are open to all constructive suggestions but , as I have mentioned , we are committed to the principle of targeted support for Community products of clearly identifiable quality .
<en> Another issue has arisen with regard to the future of this sector , which I personally - but the other Commissioners , too - consider absolutely vital for the economy of the European Union , but above all that of certain mountainous regions and regions with a particularly difficult hydrogeological system .
<en> I therefore wished to respond to the suggestion of creating a group of Commission and Member State representatives to monitor developments in this sector .
<en> Concerning the creation of such a group , it goes without saying that comments and proposals from Member States and from stakeholders are always welcomed by the Commission , which , I believe , must become even more open to requests from across the European Union .
<en> Nevertheless , various bodies with responsibility for this sector do already exist within the Commission .
<en> The Management Committee for Sheep and Goats issues opinions on the legislation relating to the sector .
<en> The forecasting group for the ovine and caprine sectors is made up of market experts and meets twice a year to discuss market trends and forecasts .
<en> The conclusions of those meetings are forwarded to the Advisory Group on Sheepmeat and Goatmeat , which also meets twice a year and represents the entire sector , from farm to fork .
<en> This last group also discusses a wide range of subjects which its members can propose for inclusion on the agenda .
<en> It seems to me that the formation of another working group would involve an additional administrative burden and would in a sense duplicate the functions of the existing management system : it would in fact conflict with the aim of simplifying the CAP .
<en> I am nevertheless prepared - and I believe I can also speak for Commissioner Fischer Boel here - to explore any possibilities existing within the present framework .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - Mr President , it was remiss of me not to welcome the new Commissioner , to thank him and to wish him well .
<en> I should of course also like to thank all the speakers here tonight , particularly the shadow rapporteurs , for their contributions .
<en> I would also like to thank the Slovenian Presidency for their support over the last six months , during which they agreed that the development of the sheep sector would be put on the agenda of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in March .
<en> This gave the Agriculture Ministers across the Community an opportunity to discuss the crisis .
<en> My thanks also to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , Neil Parish , who has been very helpful and supportive .
<en> Briefly , I want to refer to the amendments and matters raised here tonight .
<en> I have heard the view from the Commission in relation to the implementation task force .
<en> Now I know I am right because they are against it .
<en> I find it very difficult to agree to Amendment 2 .
<en> Some proposals have been made to me .
<en> If we can get proper wording I have no difficulty with that , but I will not dilute the importance of what we are trying to achieve .
<en> Again , my view on electronic identification has always been clear .
<en> I am against it - not least due to the high costs involved - but also the benefits are unproven and there are difficulties in implementation .
<en> I have , however , always stated that each Member State should be allowed the option of introducing this system on a voluntary basis .
<en> Therefore I am unable to support Amendment 4 but I can support Amendment 1 by the PPE-DE Group deferring the implementation of the system until 2012 at the earliest .
<en> All the other amendments proposed I will accept .
<en> I am not going to go through them now but I can accept Amendments 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 3 and 5 .
<en> I think it is worth pointing out that since 2003 it has been stated that any sector in the common agricultural policy facing difficulty or disadvantage will be prioritised in the context of the CAP health check .
<en> In the forthcoming check I would ask the Commissioner for Agriculture to ensure that the interests of the sheep and goat sector are comprehensively addressed .
<en> Finally , I would like to take this opportunity to wish the French presidency well over the next six months .
<en> They will be very important to this report .
<en> I have met with the French Minister for Agriculture , Mr Barnier , who is already committed to having a discussion on these sectors at the November meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers .
<en> I am confident that he , who has a well-informed understanding of the challenges that the sheep and goat sector faces , will do his utmost to ensure that the necessary proposals in this report on the future of the sheep and goat sectors are implemented in the context of the CAP health check .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Thursday , 19 June 2008 .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Sheep farming is one of the sectors of animal production that has received less attention recently in comparison to pig or cattle farming .
<en> Sheep farming is , however , particularly important for countries with difficult geographical conditions .
<en> It is also important for regions where , for reasons of historical tradition , the rearing and consumption of lamb is very important to the population .
<en> Care should be taken to ensure that this sector does not collapse .
<en> This is particularly relevant now that we are witnessing rocketing food prices .
<en> We simply cannot afford to restrict this production .
<en> I fully support the rapporteur 's proposal to introduce additional payments aimed at traditional mountain breeds in order to protect sheep in sensitive areas .
<en> I also support the proposal to identify mutton with an EU logo so as to distinguish it from third-country products .
<en> We are duty bound to assist the citizens of Europe to differentiate between good food and food that might not comply with European standards .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to sincerely apologise to Cristiana Muscardini because I got so carried away by my enthusiasm that Mr Poignant so kindly highlighted that I forgot to respond to you and say how much we will need your group .
<2en> I am aware of who is part of it , and I know that you are among those who love Europe , and that there are MEPs who equally love their nations .
<2en> Mrs Muscardini , you can be sure that I will take your remarks fully into consideration , and that during the next six months I will try , along with the European institutions , to build a Europe that responds to your concerns .
<2en> So , you are the one who has shown - proving Mr Poignant right - that I am forgetful of how overrated my reputation is .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , a few weeks ago Ireland said ' no ' , and I think that , as we all know , this illustrates the increasing split between European citizens .
<en> This ' no ' should obviously not be underestimated , and I think that , on the contrary , it should force all political leaders to take into account the expectations and concerns of the people and try to provide answers to them , whatever treaty is in force .
<en> It is not the case that if we had the Lisbon Treaty tomorrow everything would disappear with a wave of a magic wand .
<en> The French Presidency has chosen to focus on four areas , which is obviously very helpful , especially regarding climate change .
<en> However , during this time of deep crisis , a financial and food crisis , an explosion in the price of raw materials , and increasingly scarce and increasingly expensive oil , I think that what the people are expecting is not only a matter of issues , but also a matter of vision ; what the people are expecting is a matter of prospects .
<en> Right now I would like to suggest three avenues for reflection .
<en> The first concerns the fundamental , essential issue of our identity .
<en> I believe , I have a deep conviction , that there is a European model , that there is a European blueprint for society .
<en> This European model is economic , sustainable and also social .
<en> This European model , for example , seeks to combat the growing inequalities .
<en> There is , therefore , a European model , and we should be proud of it , we should assert it , carry it , take it up , defend it and protect it .
<en> That is the first avenue .
<en> Then there is a second avenue for reflection .
<en> I think that we need a new vision for the organisation of the world .
<en> In saying that , I am thinking particularly of Africa .
<en> I am thinking of the issue of agricultural products ; I think we should stop subsidising exports of our agricultural products and instead work towards Africa being self-sufficient in terms of food and energy .
<en> This is the new revolution that we need in order to have a fairer world in the future .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> Finally , I believe , and we should never stop reminding ourselves of this , that there are European values that we should never renounce : they are called democracy and human rights , and they are valid for us in Europe , and will be valid in the future of the Union for the Mediterranean , where it will not be about doing business above all while neglecting human rights .
<en> The issue of human rights is essential for the coming decades ; it is the deep-seated identity of Europe and deserves to be defended .
<en> Mr President , these are some of the questions that I feel are before us ; they concern fundamental matters , in other words , the vision and the deeper meaning that we must and want to give to Europe .
<en> These questions are not only a matter of politics , but also a matter of conscience .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to welcome President Sarkozy again to Strasbourg and to congratulate him on engaging with Parliament , for being real with regard to ideas , even though he knew there would not be general agreement across the House with regard to those ideas .
<en> For too long we have been hoisted with the petard of failed ideologies of the past , the failure to look to the new frontiers which come before us and to meet those challenges head on .
<en> We have played safe by falling back into the comfort zone of either past imperialistic ideals or post-fascist commands or even , dare I say it , new 20th-century thinking with regard to human life and human rights .
<en> Because the complexity of the world today is very different and far more varied than what can be offered by any one single ideology or any one single plan .
<en> And rightly you mention the importance of engaging with other governments around the world : with China to solve the problem of Chad and of Sudan , ensuring that the problems with regard to Africa and the developing world are met head on .
<en> We are already commemorating today the lives of seven peacekeepers in Sudan who have lost their lives under a United Nations mandate , simply because of a failure of governments to intervene properly and put pressure on the authorities in Chad and in Sudan to protect the lives of refugees and asylum seekers .
<en> It is all very well to speak woolly words here in Parliament about the importance of immigration and allowing the free movement of people .
<en> It is better if we allow people to stay at home .
<en> I come from Ireland , a nation that had to export 12 million of its people over a hundred years .
<en> None of them wanted to leave Ireland .
<en> They were forced to leave Ireland .
<en> If we give people the opportunity to remain in their own countries , give them support through the mechanisms of the policies that we set up , whether in trade or other areas , then we can do it .
<en> Finally , Mr President-in-Office , you spoke earlier about how you felt the legitimacy of your position in bringing the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the parliament was the only way to do it .
<en> I agree with you .
<en> That is right for France .
<en> But equally legitimate is the right to have a referendum and that should always be protected .
<en> It is not an either / or .
<en> There are problems and difficulties with regard to the result in Ireland , but that is not just a problem with regard to Ireland 's relationship with Europe .
<en> It is reflective of a deeper malaise for the people and Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , right now I would like to ask you about the position of the French Presidency regarding linguistic diversity .
<en> Diversity is a founding principle of Europe .
<en> All the languages in the world are part of humanity 's heritage , and it is the duty of public institutions to take action to protect them .
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , the Council conclusions of 22 May on multilingualism invited the Commission to draw up a detailed framework on this subject , which it has announced that it will do by the autumn .
<en> What will the position and actions of the French Presidency be regarding the multilingualism policy ?
<en> What is the Presidency 's position going to be and what role does it intend to give to the non official EU languages , which are also called ' regional ' and ' minority ' languages ?
<en> Because , Mr President , as we await the vote in the French Senate next week , France is currently a very bad example to all those of us who believe that linguistic diversity is a common heritage of all Europeans .
<en> ( The speaker continued his speech in Basque )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to reply to Mr Sarkozy .
<en> You are a very good orator , Mr Sarkozy , but I am not so sure that you are that good a listener .
<en> This presidency programme that you have unveiled this morning shows that you want a European Union that controls literally every single aspect of our lives , everything from a common immigration policy through to how we run our hospitals and our football clubs .
<en> I also took it from your comments that you want us to be very isolated from the rest of the world , that if people do not have the same standards as us we are not going to trade with them .
<en> But worst of all , it is the sheer arrogance of saying that you know best when it comes to the European project .
<en> You are showing contempt , not just for the Irish people , but for the very concept of democracy which you say you are a champion of .
<en> You said the Polish President must keep his word , that he must ratify the Treaty because that was his agreement .
<en> Well , the Irish people have spoken .
<en> Will you respect the Irish vote ?
<en> Will you keep your side of that bargain which says this Treaty is dead ?
<en> I do not think that you get it , do you ?
<en> The peoples of Europe do not want deeper political integration .
<en> That is why in France they said ' no ' , and in Holland they said ' no ' , and in Ireland they said ' no ' , and if we had a vote in Britain an overwhelming majority of us would have said ' no ' .
<en> What price democracy , Mr Sarkozy ?
<en> You are going to Dublin on 21 July .
<en> Please do not try to do with them as you did in France and try to bypass a second referendum , try to get them to change the rules and to ratify this Treaty through the back door .
<en> That would be showing utter contempt for democracy .
<en> Please do not do it .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Though not perfect , the resolution adopted by the European Parliament deserves to be supported in that it confirms the unity demonstrated by Europe on the resolution of the situation in Georgia .
<en> This complex crisis proves how urgent it is for the EU to develop a proper regional strategy towards the Caucasus and Russia .
<en> Consequently , the EU would be well advised to put forward the idea of holding an international conference like the Helsinki Conference , which gave birth to the OSCE in 1975 .
<en> For the time being , it is necessary to stop the justified report concerning the negotiations on strengthening the partnership between the EU and Russia from failing to mention the need to construct a balanced dialogue with the country encompassing all issues of common interest , including democratic values and the energy dimension .
<en> In this regard , it is a pity that the European Parliament is not making a clearer call for a review of our energy strategy which , in addition to the announced diversification of our sources of supply , should also provide for the development of renewable energies and of energy saving .
<sp>
<2en> I abstained from voting on the European Parliament resolution on the events in South Ossetia and Abkhazia since the Parliament took a one-sided , unbalanced position towards Kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence from a normalised , democratised Serbia .
<2en> Parliament did not consider it appropriate to take a similar resolution on Kosovo in the name of the same principles of respect for international law and integrity of national borders that it is invoking today to denounce recognition of the independence of Ossetia and Abkhazia by Moscow .
<2en> We all know why : we did not want to criticise the countries of the West - which were quick to recognise the unilateral and illegal declaration of independence by Kosovo - for the things for which we are today quite rightly criticising Russia .
<2en> Although the Georgian government 's military initiatives , like those of Russia , should be firmly condemned and should make way for a diplomatic settlement and international mediation , the European Union cannot allow itself to apply double standards to the many ' frozen conflicts ' of the aftermath of the Cold War .
<2en> Nothing would be worse for the security of our continent than for the European Union to confuse alliances and allegiance to the ' crime-inducing ' politics of the Bush government in this part of the world , as it has in other parts .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - While the resolution expresses many views that I can support - in particular , the approach to the final status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , and the call for Russian troops to be withdrawn from Georgia proper - it also contains many unhelpful elements .
<en> The EU could play a useful role in providing civil observers and monitors and in humanitarian assistance .
<en> However , it should not seek to exploit the Georgia crisis for its own ends by calling for a strengthening of EU defence and security policy , by putting monitors under an ESDP rubric , or by endorsing the rejected Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> Furthermore , it was disappointing that the phrase ' Georgia is still on track eventually to join the ( NATO ) Alliance ' was removed in the vote .
<en> I therefore abstained on this resolution .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this resolution , which shows strong and clear unity between EU Member States in the Council and the European Parliament on this vital issue .
<en> We mourn the tragic loss of life in this conflict and condemn the violent actions of both sides .
<en> We support moves towards supporting a lasting peace , the provision of humanitarian aid to victims and reconstruction efforts .
<en> We voted to abstain on the second part of Paragraph 27 , as we are clear that this is a resolution aimed at resolving the situation in Georgia .
<en> To discuss the future membership of an external organisation such as NATO would only distract from this important focus .
<en> We wholeheartedly support the resolution 's call to ensure a lasting resolution to the conflict on the basis of the EU-brokered six-point agreement , and we call on Russia to act decisively to meet the agreed conditions of this ceasefire plan , thus allowing for the resumption of negotiations on the EU-Russia Partnership Agreement .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( CS ) I abstained from voting on the European Parliament 's resolution on the situation in Georgia , not because I would be casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Georgian stance but , on the contrary , because I would have been approving the improper and aggressive steps taken by Russia .
<en> As has often been the case recently , some Eurofederalist Members have once more misused the conflict in Georgia and the associated resolution to call for the early ratification of the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> It was this improper behaviour that caused me to abstain .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , at various stages of the production process goods are hauled to a faraway place , subsequently ending up in a completely different place as finished products .
<en> They are often transported in the most environmentally unfriendly way : by lorry on the increasingly congested motorways .
<en> The enormous growth in freight transport , which is still continuing , has been caused by a steady decrease in the costs involved .
<en> This is bad news for the environment , for safety , for working conditions and also for animal welfare .
<en> My group therefore opts for restricting the growth in transport , and for transferring the necessary remaining transport to the railways and inland waterways as far as possible .
<en> This desire is reflected in toned-down form in the European Commission proposals and in the supplementary proposals by the rapporteur , Mr Cramer .
<en> We object to the possibility of precedence being given to freight transport at the expense of passenger trains , however .
<en> The growth in freight transport may necessitate a supplementary infrastructure to prevent the two interfering with each other .
<en> In addition , I would draw attention to the problems with the launch of the uniform European safety system ERTMS .
<en> Investment in this will be beneficial for the future , but will cause problems in the short term .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should like to start by thanking Mr Cramer for his work as rapporteur .
<2en> The report is a good one , and I should like to highlight the following aspects of it .
<2en> Freight traffic must be unrestricted , honest and clean , and we are working hard in this House to make this happen .
<2en> Earlier this year , the end of cabotage restrictions came into view .
<2en> That was a good start .
<2en> This report continues in that vein , and that is excellent .
<2en> The rapporteur rightly points out that urban freight logistics require a specific approach .
<2en> It is of the utmost importance that European towns and cities be cleaned up .
<2en> I think that computerised speed adjustment in towns and cities is an excellent instrument , therefore , and I hope that the European Commission will support measures and make proposals to ensure that freight transport in towns and cities is not constantly having to brake and accelerate .
<2en> This is the way to make freight transport faster and cleaner .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) The Union 's economic development and competitiveness depend on efficient transport of goods .
<en> We have to develop the railway infrastructure , the maritime corridors , the ports infrastructure and co-modality .
<en> Improving the connections between seaports and river ports and the inland railway and road network is an important component of the logistic infrastructure .
<en> Romania 's and Bulgaria 's accession provides the European Union with an exit to the Black Sea .
<en> The Danube is now almost entirely a waterway inside the Union .
<en> This means new opportunities for the European transport of goods .
<en> Nevertheless , I emphasize that the efficient transport of goods needs : balanced use of all types of transport , decongesting traffic , simplifying procedures , legislative stability , investments in logistics systems and intelligent transport systems , such as Galileo , but especially ensuring transportation safety .
<en> Programmes such as Naiades and Marco Polo are not sufficiently used by Member States in order to improve the transport of goods .
<en> Nevertheless , I call the Commission 's attention to the barriers met by some road carriers , and I refer to the Romanian ones , when transiting the territory of certain Member States .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , Commissioner , we also have to think of our own failings , of course .
<2en> We cannot always be talking about sustainable transport on Sundays and doing the opposite from Monday to Friday .
<2en> It does seem to be the case that in the Commission 60 % of the money flowing into transport flows into roads as co-financing and only 20 % of it into environmentally friendly railways .
<2en> It can be said that transport in Europe is too cheap and environmentally friendly transport too expensive .
<2en> This is also to do with the framework conditions .
<2en> We do , for example , have a compulsory rail toll system for each Member State .
<2en> This applies to every engine , every kilometre of track , whereas the toll in environmentally damaging road transport is voluntary , its amount is limited and it applies only to motorways , and usually only to lorries of 12 tonnes or more .
<2en> You need to change these unfair framework conditions , otherwise you will resolve neither problems to do with climate policy nor transport problems .
<2en> The forecast is that traffic is on the increase .
<2en> But why is it on the increase ?
<2en> Because it does not cost anything .
<2en> There are several examples that could be mentioned .
<2en> I should like to mention one example from your home country .
<2en> The United Kingdom exports 1.5 million tonnes of pork every year .
<2en> If you look at the balance of imports , this shows that the United Kingdom also imports a further 1.5 million tonnes of pork .
<2en> We could eliminate this .
<2en> We could eliminate this transportation and use the capacity , which we definitely need , to do so .
<2en> In Europe we therefore have to eliminate a lot of the nonsense over transport capacity and then we have to shift transport over to environmentally friendly modes and design it to be efficient so that we can guarantee mobility , while providing people with the goods , but also protecting the environment , because this is the order of the day .
<2en> Without a healthy environment , neither we nor our children and children 's children have the future we all want .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Thursday 4 September .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Sustainable and efficient freight transport must indeed seriously be improved as the transport sector is responsible for a large share of CO2 emissions in the Union .
<en> As the sector is expected to grow substantially , increasing its efficiency and sustainability should be seen as an opportunity to develop its economic competitiveness and to create numerous jobs .
<en> The Union should therefore allocate resources sufficient to achieve the ambitious objectives of improved mobility , intermodality in transport modes , energy efficiency , reduced consumption of oil and reduced pollution .
<en> We welcome therefore the strategic approach of the proposed Freight Transport Action Plan and its objectives : to focus on freight corridors using a combination of the various modes of transport ; to promote innovative technologies and infrastructures ; more efficient freight transport management and to enhance the attractiveness of modes of transport other than road .
<en> To ensure the success of a sustainable European transport policy , we - of course - have to bear in mind the importance of fostering synergies and complementarities with other European policies such as energy and environment policies .
<en> Cross-border harmonisation of national rules and synergy with the other related policies are necessary conditions for the achievement of the objectives of sustainable and efficient freight transport .

<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , overweight and obesity are a major problem for our society .
<en> We know that we cannot change consumer behaviour with legislation .
<en> Rather , changed behaviour throughout society has an impact on the individual : after all , who wants to be an outsider ?
<en> Our health behaviour and diet are influenced by our social environment .
<en> There have been complaints that meat consumption is on the increase .
<en> However , it is on the increase because more people in society can afford to eat meat , not because per capita meat consumption itself is rising .
<en> A healthy relationship with food and drink is particularly important .
<en> An obsession with being thin is as bad for health as compulsive eating .
<en> Eating habits cannot be regulated by law .
<en> People 's dietary needs vary , and there is no ' one size fits all ' requirement in terms of people 's calorific or fat intake .
<en> People are different , and their individual energy needs differ too , depending on age , gender , occupation , and activity levels .
<en> Bans are a poor substitute for common sense .
<en> We do not need new legislation : what we need are information campaigns to impart knowledge .
<en> We need freedom , not nannying .
<en> Freedom also implies responsibility .
<en> Our citizens are intelligent adults who can think for themselves .
<en> Traffic-light labelling is not representative as it only shows certain aspects in isolation , so it confuses consumers .
<en> What should I choose if a product label shows that a specific food has red , yellow and green nutritional elements ?
<en> The food industry will pass the costs of the new labelling on to the consumer , driving up prices even further .
<en> I am against a ' nannying ' approach and mandatory front-of-pack nutritional labelling using colour coding , and I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote against paragraph 37 of the report .
<en> If necessary , we can deal with this later in a different context , when we look at the issue of labelling .
<en> Let us take the White Paper on nutrition , overweight and obesity-related health issues as an opinion-forming tool which provides food for thought for society , not as an opportunity to impose even more conditions and create new legislation !
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for successfully tackling such an oversized topic .
<en> Firstly , I should stress the importance of providing free lunches for schoolchildren , which is the practice in my home country of Lithuania but is far from that of all Member States .
<en> Of course there are objections relating to insufficient funding and generally about the quality of food which is actually on the plate , but it helps children - especially from the poorest families - to have proper and decent-quality meals .
<en> I also welcome an initiative to distribute fruit and vegetables free in schools .
<en> It should be considered as an example of best practice .
<en> I believe EU funding could be helpful in assisting Member States with the financial burden .
<en> The importance of this is that such projects take the EU directly to citizens .
<en> Last but certainly not least , the report fails to mention consumption in the sense of over-consumption .
<en> These days , changing consumption patterns equal a change in our lifestyles .
<en> It is perhaps hard to imagine a parallel between obesity and climate change but , indeed , such dependency exists .
<en> If we started to think about both topics at the same time , perhaps we would fly fewer of our apples and strawberries from abroad and grow more of them at home , selling them at local food markets instead of supermarkets - which is exactly one of the points that the current report proposes .
<sp>
<en> ( ET ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the number of people who are overweight and obese has been discussed here several times already but , according to the experts , a further 1.3 million people will join their ranks next year .
<en> This is the equivalent of the entire population of my homeland , Estonia , a terrifying thought .
<en> There are many factors behind poor diet and obesity , although doubtless we must take the cost , availability and awareness of food into account in our assessment .
<en> Sixteen European Union countries have kept VAT on food below the standard rate , a laudable decision .
<en> The proposal included in the report to reduce VAT on fruit and vegetables to below five per cent is welcome .
<en> The WHO health report refers to a low intake of fruit and vegetables as one of seven health risks .
<en> In that context it would be commendable to start providing fruit in schools , and European Union support would be necessary if we are to introduce the measure in all 27 Member States .
<en> One cannot say much in one minute but I would like to add a couple of words on advertising and the media .
<en> Their help and ideas are needed to advertise carrots , not Pepsi-Cola , and on the kinds of stereotypes and body images to advertise , as these play a very important role in raising people 's awareness .
<en> Allow me , as I finish , to thank the Committee and the rapporteur for their efforts .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , we are today debating the growing number of obese people .
<en> At the same time , the Committee on Agriculture is debating the future agricultural policy .
<en> In a sense , both these debates concern the same issue , namely the health of our society and of young people in particular .
<en> It sometimes seems to me that in certain documents we lament health problems whilst in others we promote GMOs , cloning and importing food from regions where it is produced using methods far removed from natural ones .
<en> In the framework of the WTO , our negotiators want further opening to markets outside Europe .
<en> We should ask ourselves whether we really care about our society or whether we are simply paying lip service .
<en> Most of the direct payments to agriculture go to large agri-business concerns that produce food with a high chemical content rather than to family farms producing healthy food .
<en> Clearly , this report is sorely needed , but the main findings it contains must be implemented .
<en> In the light of the Commission 's current priorities , I seriously doubt that this will be the case .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , 27 % of men , 38 % of women and one child in four are now considered to be either overweight or obese in Europe , and there are some 400 000 new cases a year .
<en> This is a blight that is taking hold on European society .
<en> Information campaigns and preventive measures are certainly an effective response because , unfortunately , we are now confronted with a public health issue that is also developing into a social problem .
<en> Regrettably , obesity is also frequently associated with poverty and exclusion .
<en> Much has been talked about information campaigns and prevention .
<en> I do not wish to go back over what has been said about food labelling , the role of the public authorities , school canteens , sports facilities , proper information , a healthy diet and the need for daily physical exercise .
<en> However , I would draw attention to the important role played by health professionals , who are there to identify chronic health risks linked to obesity , including diabetes and cardiovascular disease and of course the consequences that such ailments have for overweight people .
<en> Prevention is achieved by exchanging best practices while at the same time respecting the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> Studies have shown , for example , that a waist measurement greater than 88 cm for women , apart from during pregnancy , and above 102 cm for men is the definition of abdominal obesity and constitutes a health risk , and this applies irrespective of the person 's height .
<en> This very simple benchmark is still not being sufficiently recognised by GPs .
<en> Waistline measurement should therefore be made a simple point of reference for all patients and should trigger an immediate investigation of the associated risk factors , including glucose intolerance , which is a sign of pre-diabetes , excess cholesterol , triglycerides and arterial hypertension , and we also know , unfortunately , that all these symptoms point to the development of Alzheimer 's disease .
<en> This is why we really need to accentuate the role that health professionals have to play in this area .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I move now to the order of business .
<en> Mrs Pack , I understand that you wish to make a request concerning the agenda for Thursday .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , on behalf of all members of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , I would like to make a heartfelt plea that we should not , as planned , have a combined debate on culture , education and youth on Thursday morning , as these three topics should not be thrown together .
<2en> There may well be points of contact between them , but they need to be dealt with separately .
<2en> I ask that these three topics be dealt with in the same time as set aside for the joint debate , and I believe that this is something that this House would support .
<sp>
<en> Let me then make a proposal which the House in its wisdom is at liberty to accept or reject .
<en> In the light of this request I propose taking the three reports from the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport in separate debates .
<en> ( The House agreed to this proposal )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , you proposed a change to the agenda based on the Council ' s availability , which , of course , we understand .
<2en> Basically , your proposal is to take Mr MacCormick ' s reports on the waiver of parliamentary immunity now and , whatever the quality of the work by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which gave its opinion on the two reports last week , we believe that the time we have been given to examine the two requests for the waiver of parliamentary immunity might be insufficient .
<2en> We also believe , in the interests of holding a good debate , in order for our parliamentary democracy and the essential procedure of parliamentary immunity to function properly , in order for us all to be able to give our honest opinion , having had the opportunity to examine all the documents and in order that we do not give poorly informed opinions , that it would have been better to place the two reports on the agenda of the Strasbourg part-session .
<2en> I hope that the House can support us in this decision .
<sp>
<en> Rule 6 ( 6 ) is very clear : " The report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled " .
<en> Under the Rules I am suggesting the correct procedure today .
<en> The rule itself is very clear and it does not seem to fall within the discretion of the President or , at this moment , of the House itself , to alter that rule .
<en> I understand and appreciate the point you make about political preparation but it seems to me that this must remain on our order of business in order to respect the Rules of Procedure .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , this change to the agenda was not taken into account when you made your proposal .
<2en> This change is directly related to the Council ' s availability .
<2en> Until now , it has always been customary to examine waivers for parliamentary immunity at the Strasbourg part-sessions .
<2en> I understand perfectly well , therefore , that we placed this issue at the head of Monday ' s agenda , but I do not think this was what was intended , especially after last week ' s vote by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
<sp>
<en> Madam Berès I made the suggestion to take the McCormick report at 4 p.m. because of the lack of availability of the President-in-Office , not on the assumption that the reports would not have been taken today .
<en> Our agenda , as originally foreseen for today , was to be led by the Council on the Barcelona Council .
<en> Mr McCormick 's reports would ordinarily under our Rules of Procedure have appeared in today 's agenda .
<en> My announcement was simply to reverse the order on the grounds of the absence of the Council .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , I would like to draw Parliament 's attention to the situation of Christians in Vietnam .
<en> For 50 years they have been obliged to renounce their faith , they have had their property confiscated and they have been resettled in different regions .
<en> In recent times this persecution has been particularly starkly manifested in Hanoi , where the authorities are brutally intervening against Catholics from the Thai Ha community who are protesting against the unlawful seizure of lands belonging to this community , which is run by the Redemptorist Fathers .
<en> For example , on 31 August participants in a procession were subjected to brutal beatings .
<en> More than 20 people suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospital .
<en> Journalists were also beaten , including Associated Press reporter Ben Stocking .
<en> Let us do all we can to ensure that Vietnam , which is currently a member of the UN Security Council , observes human rights .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , this evening my report on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty , including child poverty , is the last item on the agenda .
<en> This is an own initiative report which is being handled according to Rules 131 a and 45 of our Rules of Procedure on short presentations in plenary , i.e. in a presentation without open debate by Members and without the opportunity to propose amendments .
<en> I object to this self-limitation of the rights of Members of the European Parliament and call for us as the European Parliament to change these rules .
<en> It is wrong for important matters such as combating poverty and social exclusion not to be discussed openly here .
<en> All the same , the committee has debated intensely and made 200 amendments and 40 compromise amendments .
<en> It is a matter of public interest and we are denying ourselves some of our own rights when we forego discussing it here in plenary .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , in India the number of Christian martyrs horribly murdered by Hindu executioners is still on the rise .
<en> The Catholic Church is appealing in various parts of the world to governments and international institutions for aid for Christians in India , Iraq and Vietnam , so far without success .
<en> Sadly , the persecution of Christians is still accompanied by passivity , not only on the part of representatives of the government and legal institutions in that location , but also on the part of other democratic governments and international institutions that are actively involved in other instances of human rights violation , and this also concerns the European Union .
<en> I would therefore like to protest before the European Parliament against the fact that human rights violations in India , Iraq and Vietnam are being ignored - I am also addressing the European Commission here - and I would like to appeal for diplomatic intervention and objection where such acts of barbarity have occurred .
<en> Passivity in the face of persecution may constitute evidence of a particular kind of discrimination against Catholics .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) In the past 50 years , the strong Slovak national minority in Hungary of over 200 000 people has been almost completely annihilated .
<en> On the other hand , the Hungarian minorities in the surrounding countries , Slovakia included , are growing .
<en> Paradoxically , for many years the Hungarians have been making Europeans believe that it is their minority that is oppressed .
<en> Several current Hungarian political leaders talk openly about the idea of a Greater Hungary .
<en> Sadly , this goes unnoticed by Europe 's senior politicians .
<en> The Hungarian Parliament organises in its chambers a cross-border forum of Hungarian Members of Parliament for the Carpathian Basin .
<en> Representatives of ethnic Hungarian political parties in Slovakia and Romania openly meet to discuss autonomy .
<en> In today 's Europe such attitudes are unacceptable and dangerous .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , Romania is unfortunately facing a serious issue which endangers the safety and the health of European citizens : the use of non-sterile surgical thread imported from China in hospitals .
<en> The Romanian Ministry of Health has known about this problem since August but , in spite of warnings that this might cause infections or even lead to the death of patients , it did not stop it in time .
<en> The alarm was sounded after a patient died in hospital due to an infection and other patients are facing the same danger .
<en> I believe that this is a warning signal not only for Romania but for all of Europe .
<en> The fact that more and more products brought from China raise question marks and endanger the health and safety of European citizens is a very serious matter .
<en> Not so long ago we had problems with sweets contaminated from powdered milk containing melanine , also imported from China .
<en> We import products from China because they are cheaper , but I believe that Europe should put the health of its citizens first .
<en> I am asking Commissioner Vassiliou to start an investigation in order to prevent any other incidents in the Member States .
<en> We need urgent measures to inspect these products so as to stop imports to the internal market in due time .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I would just like to clarify one thing , my dear Astrid , speaking time is limited to one minute , not two .
<en> That is almost like undeclared work .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the resolution as it represents an unequivocal call to the Belarusian Government to respect human rights at last .
<en> It is disappointing that hopes of democratic development for the Belarusian people who have to live under Europe 's last dictatorship were not fulfilled by the parliamentary elections which took place in September and which were dubious , if not to say falsified .
<en> The same applies to the strategic repression of the opposition and civil society .
<en> We have also called on the Council and the Commission today to take further steps towards facilitating and intensifying people-to-people contacts and democratising the country and to consider the possibilities for lowering the cost of visas for Belarusian citizens entering the Schengen territory , which is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming increasingly isolated .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the defeat of democracy in Belarus is particularly painful in the context of the Union 's new policy of reconciliation towards that country , following the events in Georgia .
<en> Mr Lukashenko failed to recognise the gesture made by Europe and the opportunity to emerge from isolation .
<en> The OSCE report states that the elections in Belarus did not meet democratic standards .
<en> The new parliament will therefore once again be composed of people subservient to Europe 's last dictator .
<en> It seems necessary to continue the policy of thawing mutual relations despite these abuses .
<en> It must be emphasised , however , that the Union should not be the only one to make concessions .
<en> The President of Belarus needs to display clear goodwill as demonstrated by appropriate actions .
<en> The pressure on Mr Lukashenko ought to be stepped up , but at the same time benefits should be offered to the people of Belarus , so that Europe 's offer is perceived as a better choice than the alternative of forging closer ties with Russia .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the successful completion of the negotiations in the framework of the Doha Round seems increasingly unlikely .
<en> Mr Mandelson 's resignation from the post of Trade Commissioner is one reason for this .
<en> The talks will probably only resume after the start of 2010 .
<en> The situation is further complicated by the fact that during the next two years elections are due not only in the United States but also in India and in Brazil .
<en> This means that the new negotiations will be conducted by a different group of people .
<en> For the first time , the European Union is not responsible for the breakdown of the talks .
<en> The United States and India are to be blamed for the collapse of the July ministerial talks .
<en> According to the experts , however , the main reason for the breakdown was a lack of progress on services and industry .
<en> Should there be a return to the negotiating table , priority must be given to consideration of how to help the poorest countries .
<en> At the same time , however , we must not disregard our own interests , notably those of the agricultural sector .
<en> Opening up our market unduly would amount to a serious threat to the stability of farm incomes .
<en> Many farms could be bankrupted as a result .
<en> Should that happen , how would we be able to guarantee the European Union 's food security ?
<en> Failure to reach agreement on trade issues is an example of how difficult it is to reach a compromise on important matters when such a large number of countries with such varied interests are involved in the talks .
<en> Let us hope for a more positive outcome to the international negotiations on combating climate change .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , thank you very much for offering me this opportunity to offer my explanation of vote on the suspension of the Doha Round .
<en> It is with great gratitude that I recognise that most of this House is quite sad at the suspension of the WTO Doha Round , because actually there were real goals to be gained from further liberalisation .
<en> Unfortunately , once again , it was agriculture that held us up , and , while the EU managed to avoid the blame , I think we have to recognise that we had our own internal politics and that , when Commissioner Mandelson wanted to go further on agriculture , he was held back by some of the most protectionist states in the European Union .
<en> We need to recognise that there is a greater goal out here ; that services that make up so much of our economy need to be unlocked and liberalised .
<en> Unfortunately we have to unlock agriculture and goods before we unlock trade in services .
<en> We need further opening of trade .
<en> We need to stop protecting uncompetitive farmers .
<en> We need to make it easier for entrepreneurs and farmers in developing countries and poorer countries to trade with us , sell their goods and services , because only trade , not the large aid industry , will help these people out of poverty .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I have received a motion from the Independence and Democracy Group to appoint Mr Farage to replace Mr Colman as a member of the Committee on International Trade .
<en> Are there any objections to this ?
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , is there a minimum period for serving on a committee , or is this just intended for today ?
<sp>
<en> You would need to put that question to the Independence and Democracy Group , of course , but I can assure you that the President of Parliament will support absolute transparency in this matter .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , just to reassure my Austrian colleague , I was in fact a member of the Committee on International Trade for the first two and a half years of this parliamentary term .
<en> I then gave way to a colleague who retired from Parliament completely two weeks ago .
<en> So , contrary to what you may fear , this is not just a last-minute put-up job .
<sp>
<en> You have not answered the question as to how long you intend to serve on this committee , but I would infer from your remarks that you will continue to do so until the end of this parliamentary term .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality . - ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , I think that the multiannual programme on protecting children using the Internet and other communication technologies is the European Union 's head start in the global field of child protection .
<en> It is therefore an opportunity for us to congratulate the rapporteur of the European Parliament , because we too are part of this and are demonstrating our awareness .
<en> In particular , as the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , we stress in our opinion that consideration must always be given to the peculiarities of each gender , the participation of each gender , the knowledge and use of new technologies and the special protection which each gender needs separately and the protection from dangers which differ from one gender to another , from boys to girls , and which must be stated and analysed separately .
<en> We also refer to protection for vulnerable groups , for vulnerable children exposed to the dangers of sexual abuse , harassment and bullying .
<en> Another sector which we highlight is information for parents , carers and educators , whoever they may be .
<en> We also stress the need for research into greater child protection .
<en> We do , of course , know that you have carried out an impact assessment and held a public consultation on this .
<en> However , research must continue and must refer in particular to gender differences .
<en> We also wish to emphasise the need to develop entrepreneurship , which must overcome the obstacles and dangers , address the dangers and continue , so that we have a Europe which is strong in development and in protecting its citizens .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
<en> This report was tailor-made for me , since all four of my children surf the Net , and I am confronted with these worries on a daily basis .
<en> EU Member States are doing a great deal to make the World Wide Web more child-friendly , and we must not forget that as early as 1999 the Commission launched a ' Safer Internet + ' programme that is still in force today .
<en> As we have heard , the programme is aimed at fighting against harmful and illegal content , and places great emphasis on increasing awareness about the use of the Internet , as well as on promoting the development of a safe online environment .
<en> To what has already been said I would like to add only that between 2001 and 2007 , 20 000 children disappeared , 500 of whom were found .
<en> Among the tasks listed , I would like to emphasise the fight against illegal content and combating harmful conduct online .
<en> In this area there are great deficiencies : not every EU Member State has a hotline where you can immediately report any illegal content you have come across or if you discover sites which try to groom children .
<en> The other important thing we must not forget is that establishing a knowledge base will require greater and more effective cooperation among Member States .
<en> It is no accident that this programme devotes almost half of the EUR 55 million in funding to raising public awareness , since prevention is the best cure .
<en> In any case law enforcement agencies spend all their time tracking criminals , whether we are talking about software-related or any other type of crime .
<en> It is precisely for this reason that we would like to draw the attention of Member States to the fact that they could set aside funds of their own , in addition to the European Union 's EUR 55 million , and could cooperate more effectively in implementing the programme laid out in this report .
<en> The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the approval of the report .
<en> Thank you very much .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group - ( BG ) Thank you , Mr President. ladies and gentlemen .
<en> Mrs Angelilli , please allow me to extend to you my thanks and my heartfelt congratulations on your report .
<en> Now with the world financial crisis as the main issue , it is right that we are focusing all our attention on it .
<en> But somehow the issue of computer crime against children has been sidelined , even though we are aware that we may at any moment face a major threat in the form of a real pandemic of illegal web content .
<en> Just today the BBC broadcast a study , a survey it had conducted , which showed that three out of four children have come across websites with harmful content .
<en> This report does not just sound the alarm , but also offers a real raft of ideas on how to combat illegal web content .
<en> I worked on the issue as a shadow rapporteur .
<en> Last week I organised a round-table meeting back home in Bulgaria .
<en> It was attended by representatives of the police services , the non-governmental sector , the Child Protection Agency and mobile phone operators and suppliers .
<en> The theme of the meeting was this report .
<en> We had an earnest , detailed discussion which reached a number of conclusions .
<en> Firstly , a lot of work needs to be done to raise awareness of the gravity and reality of this problem throughout European society .
<en> Unfortunately it is a problem that is frequently off our radar .
<en> Secondly , the upbringing of children should start with the family and the school , which in turn brings about the need for specialised instruction for parents and teachers .
<en> Individual efforts are doomed .
<en> What is very important is coordinated action , information exchange , the creation of a database and international cooperation .
<en> Many of the institutions I mentioned urged the European Commission to recommend that Member States increase penalties under national legislation for distributing , creating and trading in harmful and illegal content .
<en> They also recommended setting up a European legal framework for conducting criminal proceedings .
<en> From now on there should be greater awareness of the programme among European institutions and citizens .
<en> Continuing to set up hotlines is also extremely important .
<en> It is also very important for us to cooperate with the police authorities and set up this database .
<en> A ' child-friendly ' common label is needed to help parents and children recognise safe sites .
<en> I am convinced that the programme will continue after 2013 and that there will be further programmes in the European Union .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , freedom of use of the Internet , mobile telephones and other kinds of communication technology is very valuable for adults , but may prove harmful to children , because the latter are not fully mature and lack the necessary experience .
<2en> The Internet is an extremely useful tool for us all , yet it has been exploited to set up sites for the exchange of paedophile and pornographic material , and also used to attempt to contact minors .
<2en> The same is true of mobile telephony .
<2en> Other less extreme activities may also be harmful .
<2en> Advertising of unhealthy foodstuffs on television and the Internet targeted at children impacts negatively on their health .
<2en> It may also lead to family disputes and result in inappropriate eating habits within peer groups .
<2en> The House recently debated issues relating to obesity and overweight in children .
<2en> Spending many hours a day in front of a computer monitor or television screen reduces a child 's physical activity and is detrimental to his or her proper physical development .
<2en> On average children spend three hours a day in this way , but many actually spend much longer in front of a screen .
<2en> The aggressive behaviour presented in television programmes has a negative psychological effect on children .
<2en> It is therefore very important to implement the programme aimed at ensuring responsible use of new communication technologies by children and young people .
<2en> I congratulate the rapporteur and the European Commission on tackling this issue .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) As one of the co-authors of the report on the strategy on children 's rights I am delighted that we are now debating in this House a bill on the protection of children who use the Internet and other communications technologies .
<en> The Internet is a classic example of something which is can greatly benefit people , but which can be harmful to society when exploited by criminals .
<en> Every day we hear how children are lured and abused through the Internet and led into prostitution , paedophilia and pornography .
<en> It is therefore the duty of everyone , starting with parents of course , to explain to children the rules for using and not abusing the Internet , as well as the risks it brings .
<en> Children are attracted by computers from a very young age .
<en> We adults often envy them their technical skills , but in their childish naivety they can easily be abused .
<en> I am thankful that this House is prioritising activities of this kind , and I support accelerating the proposed programme so that implementation can get under way by January 2009 .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Abuse and exploitation of children , via the internet , mobile phones and other technologies , is abhorrent and unacceptable , but measures to protect them - and to punish those who harm or seek to harm them - need to be taken at national level and between national governments on a co-operative basis .
<en> As always , we believe that action at EU level is not the answer .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FI ) I voted in favour of Mrs Angelilli 's report because one of the most fundamental and durable structures in the European values base is our duty to protect innocent souls , that is to say , children .
<en> Children 's rights and their protection are at the heart of human values .
<en> The internet poses numerous threats , which children need to be shielded against more effectively than is the case now .
<en> Measures at Community level are justified in this area .
<en> We still need to remind one another of the ' millstone ' and the ' deepness of the sea ' .
<en> We also have to be aware of our own responsibilities as parents .
<en> I supported all the amendments that stressed the importance of information and education for parents , teachers and any other people who have dealings with children .
<en> It is very important to enlighten parents in this way and thus promote the use of responsible communication technologies .
<en> Furthermore , Amendment 23 , which also deals with the problems of ' grooming ' and electronic harassment , and various forms of violent content , is important .
<en> The proposals in Amendment 26 to introduce different technical tools and firm up the responsibility that service providers have are only right and proper .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) According to the Internet Watch Foundation , an English organisation which fights the possession and dissemination of child pornography images , the online sexual exploitation of children for commercial purposes is a growing sector which is low-risk and highly profitable .
<en> Indeed , the sale of these images on the Internet constitutes a vile trade worth billions of euros .
<en> We endorse the approach of the Commission and our fellow Member in wanting to put a stop to this kind of activity , in particular , by establishing a blocking mechanism for credit card or electronic payments when child pornography images are bought on the Internet .
<en> Unfortunately , there is currently a serious technical limitation to all the national and European protection mechanisms being developed .
<en> In fact , most commercial servers offering these images are not located in Europe , but in the United States , Russia and Asia .
<en> Therefore , their illegal content can easily be uploaded in one country and viewed in another .
<en> It is therefore understandable that effective means to counter the development of Internet paedophilia , while necessary , are problematical .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We welcome the report aimed at creating a safer online environment for children .
<en> It is our responsibility to protect our children from dangerous material containing child pornography and violence .
<en> However , the report should not be used as a pretext for the harmonisation of criminal law in the EU .
<en> First and foremost , we need better co-ordination between national legal systems .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I fully support the need for the EUR 55 million budget to ensure that children , many of whom spend at least three hours a day on the internet , are better protected from unsafe user content .
<en> I support the need to better inform parents and carers through information packs about the dangers of the internet .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution because the European Union needs to have a much more mature reflection on the balance between security and freedom .
<en> It goes without saying that both are core values for the citizens in the Member States and need to be protected in equal measure .
<en> However , we need to be aware that the technology used by criminal gangs or terrorists is , in very many cases , more advanced than that which our law enforcement agencies have available .
<en> The EU has no excuse for not using the most advanced technical resources available , if using them can mean avoiding the loss of human life .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) In recent years , stricter security requirements in air transport have increasingly led to questions about their compatibility with individual rights .
<en> This need to harmonise interests traditionally arises in the area of freedom and privacy in particular .
<en> These concerns have arisen once again in this case and demand an appropriate response which we believe can be given .
<en> If we take into account , on the one hand , the level of invasion of current methods and , on the other hand , the answers provided by solutions which involve the recording of images and ensure a physical distance between the security person and the passenger being checked , it seems that some of these questions have been overcome or at least could be overcome .
<en> There is , however , another question which I believe has not been sufficiently covered and which raises major concerns .
<en> The health implications of this technology have not yet been adequately studied .
<en> The value put at risk in this case , namely the health of citizens , demands that care be taken .
<en> This will be difficult to ensure if measures are adopted without the conditions proposed by the original version of the text put to the vote .
<en> I therefore voted against the amendment which aimed to remove these conditions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution , demanding that the problems associated with body scanning be investigated before a decision is taken .
<en> The resolution could have gone further , however .
<en> I am opposed in principle to the use of body scanning , which involves too great an infringement of privacy and is disproportionate to what it is desired to achieve .
<en> The current system is already on the verge of being an invasion of privacy and is sufficiently secure .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The unacceptable EU motion for a resolution on the use of body scanners at airports has nothing to do with the security of aviation ; it forms part of the reactionary policy of the EU and is a grossly flagrant breach of the personal rights and freedom of workers , with painful consequences for their health and safety .
<en> The demagogic references , reservations and objections to the lack of guarantees relating to body scanners contained in the joint motion for a resolution in question by the European Parliament pave the way for the application of this unacceptable and highly dangerous system .
<en> The proposed measure , which is a vulgar insult to the dignity of man and his very personality and , at the same time , puts his health at serious risk , reveals yet again the real , repulsive face of the EU of capital .
<en> The people must again draw their own conclusions .
<en> Electronically undressing citizens , with or without ' guarantees ' , is totally unacceptable and it needs to be roundly and decisively condemned straight away .
<en> Resistance , disobedience and insubordination in the face of the policy and measures of the EU are the only way for the people to safeguard their fundamental dignity .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) The large majority of all nations in the former Yugoslavia wish to join the EU .
<en> This wish has been expressed not only by the Albanians and Macedonians in Macedonia , who only recently found a solution to their differences of opinion regarding the government of that country , but also by the Serbs , Montenegrins and Albanian Kosovars , who recently bade farewell to a common state , along with the Serbs , Croats and Bosnians in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
<en> The EU would do well not to overestimate the significance of this .
<en> The fact that they wish to work together within the EU says nothing at all about the state structure where they live .
<en> This is in the hands of the people themselves , not the EU .
<en> If they have to choose between regional self-governance and a transfer of powers to a central government , because that is what the EU wants , then they will opt for the former .
<en> The war in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995 came about because the majority of residents did not want a central government , but a loose partnership at most .
<en> Yesterday 's debate clearly demonstrated that a large majority of this Parliament would opt for more central government in Bosnia-Herzegovina rather than decentralisation .
<en> Since this goal is unattainable , the EU condemns itself to an indefinite presence in that country .
<en> This is why I will be voting against .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the peace agreement reached in Goma on 28 January 2008 did not resolve the problems nor did it bring about peace in the eastern territories of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
<2en> The raping of women and even small girls continued , as did looting and the forced conscription of civilians and children into the armed forces .
<2en> All sides in the conflict committed atrocities .
<2en> I could mention the rebel groups , the fighters of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda , and the Congolese army .
<2en> The clashes resumed , proving that the war which began over four years ago is continuing and intensifying .
<2en> Worrying information has recently emerged from North Kivu , concerning hundreds of dead bodies dumped in rivers and around one hundred thousand displaced people .
<2en> Not only is the war causing fatalities , but it is also resulting in devastation , more acute hunger and widespread demoralisation .
<2en> The Congolese authorities and army will not be able to resolve the region 's problems on their own .
<2en> International assistance is required , including assistance from the European Union .
<2en> Material aid in the form of food and medical aid is also urgently needed .
<2en> The Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully supports this resolution before the House .
<2en> The well-being of every individual and his or her right to life and peace must triumph .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the atrocities endured in the Congo are unimaginable to those of us who live in peaceful civilised societies .
<en> How can we offer practical help to people such as the Congolese ?
<en> Direct military intervention and humanitarian aid must only come from international effort under the auspices of the United Nations , but time and time again we see the leaders of these types of failed states being allowed to plunder their countries and enjoy their wealth in the Western world .
<en> The stable and peaceful countries of the world should unite to ensure that vast amounts of wealth cannot be stolen and then deposited in western banks with impunity .
<en> International agreements should be reached to ensure that leaders of such states cannot live off their ill-gotten gains .
<en> This would be at least one small element of an overall solution to help develop stability in countries such as the Congo .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , renewed combat in the eastern part of the Congo is making a mockery of human rights and is silencing democracy .
<en> Despite the signing of the Goma peace accord in January of this year , the abuse of the most fundamental of human rights has continued : women of all ages being raped , massacres committed and child soldiers being gathered up .
<en> A situation of such fragility cannot be ignored .
<en> We must use our position as one of the strongest voices in the international community to call for peace , cooperation and stability in the region .
<en> We can also use this voice to condemn the recent statements of Laurent Nkunda , who called for the overthrow of the elected and legitimate government of the Congo .
<en> The Congolese army alone does not have the human , technical or financial resources to carry out its tasks in eastern Congo .
<en> But a global statement , like the signing of the Child Soldier Accountability Act this month in America , reminds us all that help can be offered to such countries and authorities in bringing violators of human rights to justice .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission shares the concerns about the degraded situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo , which is causing further stress to an already seriously affected population .
<en> It is also particularly worried about the widespread human rights violations in the region , including violence against women and the continuous mobilisation of child soldiers in the conflict .
<en> The Commission restates its conviction that the current crisis involving Kinshasa and the Congolese rebel groups has no military solution .
<en> Hence , we encourage all parties to this conflict to rapidly resume dialogue and promote courageous political compromises , taking into consideration the commitments agreed upon in January 2008 , the so-called Actes d 'engagement de Goma .
<en> In this context , it is extremely important to restore acceptable confidence levels amongst all Congolese stakeholders directly involved .
<en> As a preliminary step , all parties without exception should abide without delay by an effective ceasefire with a view to implementing the military disengagement plan provided by the United Nations .
<en> In addition , it must be borne in mind that the underlying root causes of the conflict also include the dramatic problems posed by foreign armed groups in Democratic Republic of Congo territory , in particular the Rwandan FDLR , an issue where most of the DRC commitments taken in the Nairobi communiqué have still to be put into action .
<en> Given the multiple challenges which still lie ahead in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the Commission strongly advocates that the UN 's peacekeeping mission mandate should be renewed and , where possible , strengthened in order to ensure effective protection for the population and support to the Congolese army in tackling the foreign armed groups .
<en> In addition to the relentless efforts of the EU facilitation team , it is important to ensure the broader participation of African diplomacy ( including the African Union ) in the resolution of the eastern DRC conflicts , especially in areas where a sustainable solution would be greatly facilitated by close cooperation between neighbouring countries , in particular the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda .
<en> As regards our support to the population in conflict-affected areas , the Commission will continue to provide support via both our humanitarian and development cooperation .
<en> More specifically , regarding health services ( an issue raised by all the resolutions ) , it is important to stress that the Commission has been active since 1994 in the health sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is today one of the focal sectors of our cooperation .
<en> In addition to humanitarian aid , we are currently providing strategic and financial support to the Congolese authorities to improve the quality of medical services and the qualifications of medical staff .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , on 14 November in Poznań , as every year , a march for equality was held .
<en> A group of my young colleagues , members of the Federation of Young Social Democrats , took part in the march .
<en> Their slogan was diversity yes , intolerance no .
<en> This is part of a larger campaign being held by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament throughout Europe on the issue of tolerance , and which has been underway for many months now .
<en> When the demonstration was over , the group was attacked by about a dozen thugs who beat them up and snatched banners with the logo of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
<en> One of the victims was hospitalised .
<en> I expect those responsible for this incident to be tracked down and punished by the authorities in Poland .
<en> I expect political thuggery , which aims to replace dialogue , to be universally condemned by those involved in politics .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , on Friday the EU-Russia Summit in Nice , hastily called in order to enable attendance at the G20 meeting , ended .
<en> The European Union in effect decided to renew negotiations with Russia on the partnership system , and in doing so went against its own decision , made on 1 September this year , that there would be no negotiations with Russia if Russian troops do not withdraw from the occupied territories of Georgia .
<en> The European Union is behaving in this matter like an old man , who remembers exactly what he did 50 years ago , when the Treaties of Rome came into being , and forgets what he did two months ago , when the EU gave itself and Europe its assurances on this important issue .
<en> It is now retreating from its own undertakings , and what was jointly agreed on 1 September has now been tossed aside .
<en> In this context the question arises as to whether human rights , which we in the European Parliament often champion all over the world , should also apply to European countries such as Georgia and Russia , when the European Union is simply behaving like Pontius Pilate on this issue .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , perhaps you too have heard that there are no longer refuse crises in Campania .
<en> Well , that is not the case : a few days ago in Chiaiano , which was to have been one of the sites for Berlusconi 's infamous dumps , 12 000 tonnes of asbestos and toxic waste was discovered .
<en> Where it came from no one really knows .
<en> At present in Italy there is a decree in force that clearly goes against all European legislation concerning , above all , the protection of health as well as impact assessments .
<en> What is more , the situation is being treated as a state secret , since these areas have been declared out of bounds and it is impossible to gain any access to information on what is happening there .
<en> We have called on the Commission to intervene ; we believe it has a duty to do so because to have 10 000 tonnes of asbestos and toxic waste out there in the open air is a danger to everyone .
<en> We hope that Commissioner Dimas will take action and will do so publicly .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , it is unacceptable that Slovak-Hungarian relations should unfold according to the intentions of extremist forces .
<en> We firmly condemn those who would spoil relations between these two peoples , for we know who the culprits are .
<en> In Slovakia , the government party , the Slovak National Party , is stirring up tensions with its hate speech against minorities , its outbursts that revile the nation and its anti-Hungarian slurs .
<en> In Hungary , by contrast , it is not the government authorities but extra-parliamentary extremist groups who are keen to over-react against these attacks .
<en> This is a fundamental difference .
<en> Both phenomena are to be condemned .
<en> One of the reasons for the poisoning of relations between the two peoples is that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament turned a blind eye to the policies of the Slovak SMER party coalition , thereby fuelling extreme , explicitly anti-minority policies .
<en> Therefore the Socialist Group 's decision to readmit the SMER into its ranks was a bad one , one that gives free rein to extremist anti-Hungarian expressions .
<en> Unfortunately , the coalition government in Bratislava does not provide an opportunity for the improvement of Slovak-Hungarian relations .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I do not want to go into the details now , but I think that Mr Duka-Zólyomi - with whom I am good friends - is well aware that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is highly critical of the coalition , and in particular of Mr Slota 's party .
<en> It is now time , however , particularly following the very welcome meeting between the two prime ministers , Mr Fico and Mr Gyurcsány , to arrange matters so that the two countries can resolve their problems together in peace , and not give radicals a platform .
<en> On that we agree : the radicals must not be allowed to continue spreading poison .
<en> That certainly applies to Mr Slota 's verbal radicalism , but it also applies particularly to the Hungarian Guard .
<en> I call on both countries and both prime ministers , and all parties in this House , to make every effort to silence the radicals , to stop them blockading borders and to ensure that peacefully minded people who want to protect and assist minorities have their voices heard .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to thank you for this debate .
<en> I would like to raise one issue , and perhaps the Commission could address this .
<en> We are speaking about equal pay for equal work , and we all want and desire that to happen .
<en> What is the Commission 's view of the current job situation ?
<en> I have a concern that , with so many jobs being lost in countries in the European Union , this issue could get worse rather than better because of people 's desire to earn money , even if it is less than they are truly worth .
<en> I would like some comments from the Commission on that .
<en> I would like to raise an issue of discrimination which certainly exists for men and women : public sector versus private sector workers where there are very different terms and conditions .
<en> They enjoy different pension rights and security issues and sometimes the inequalities are not just gender-based , although I appreciate that this report is about gender , and certainly my concern is that in the current situation this problem may get worse , rather than better .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , there is a difference of 15 % between salaries received by women and those received by men for carrying out the same work .
<en> In the case of women managers , this figure reaches 20 % and even 30 % , when it comes to managers of SMEs .
<en> 28 % of female researchers in industry and only 34 % of women in industry have more than one child .
<en> Commissioner , while women are on maternity leave , the average annual percentage used to calculate the benefit relating to these periods produces a financial loss , in spite of the importance of this period in terms of social welfare .
<en> Mothers must not be penalised for giving birth and looking after their children during the first few months of their life .
<en> I also believe that maternity benefit must be paid not only to mothers who have worked during the last 12 months prior to the birth .
<en> I do not think that it is a child 's fault if their mother has worked or not during this period .
<en> Above all , I believe that there must be no discrimination among children right from birth .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) I can only repeat that as far back as 1974 documents were adopted obliging Member States to pay men and women equally for the same job .
<en> However , although more than 30 years have passed , the situation has not changed .
<en> Furthermore , in my country , Lithuania , reform of the pension system has begun .
<en> Part of the funds paid by workers into the state pension insurance fund is being transferred to private pension saving funds .
<en> In a few years it became clear that in order to receive an equal annuity from these funds women must pay 35 % more contributions than men , as they live longer .
<en> Moreover , leaving these funds is like leaving slavery , it is impossible - this in itself is an infringement of human rights and freedom of choice .
<en> Apart from Lithuania only Bulgaria uses the same gender system .
<en> Having investigated such cases , I invite the Commission to take the initiative and propose decisions .
<sp>
<en> - ( CS ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that women in the European Union must work almost two months longer in order to earn as much as men is more than alarming .
<en> Even though Europe is dying , all we can do here is to state that wage discrimination against women and families with children persists up to the rate of 25 % , although women have now surpassed men in educational attainment at a ratio of 60 : 40 .
<en> Mrs Bauer has noted that in the so-called male professions the work of women is routinely undervalued for no objective reason .
<en> However , if the reason is the lack of working years that women devote instead to caring for their families , we must give the matter some serious thought .
<en> Families should not be a handicap .
<en> Mrs Bauer is making waves and her arguments for starting on a review of anti-discrimination laws are convincing .
<en> I also support the proposal that access to public tenders and projects financed from EU funds should be made conditional upon a given company being able to demonstrate an anti-discriminatory pay policy .
<en> I believe this is the way to change the gender stereotypes of employers , especially in the private sector .
<en> I would like to thank the rapporteur for a highly professional report .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , in discussing this important issue , it is typical that there have been only two male interventions on this issue .
<en> In the case of Mr Bloom , his intervention was so male , that it was difficult to agree with .
<en> However , we are considering a very important report .
<en> We are considering a report from which we know that work has great value , that it must be adequately paid , and this payment has to be differentiated on the basis of criteria such as the nature of the work , the efficiency with which it is done , ability to create added value , and not on gender criteria .
<en> But change is coming in the Member States as well .
<en> Allow me to mention my own country , where we have only very recently introduced gender equality which allows a father to take paternity leave , which shows that we are converging and we are on the right track .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for the very broad consensus that has been shown in this debate , not only in relation to the objectives of our policy for small and medium-sized enterprises , but also in relation to the steps which we are taking to achieve them .
<en> I should like to quickly answer the questions that have been raised .
<en> Mr Chichester , the European Investment Bank has already given a positive response .
<en> EUR 15 billion was planned as credit volumes by 2011 , now it is 30 billion , therefore the amount has already been doubled .
<en> Furthermore , SMEs naturally also have other financial instruments at their disposal within the European Union , in particular in connection with the Structural Fund .
<en> I also wish to point out that all major European projects are designed in such a way that small and medium-sized enterprises have privileged access to them .
<en> As far as the question of reducing costs is concerned , I am happy to be able to inform you that the Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens for European Enterprises is going according to plan .
<en> The next major step now also involves a proposal to introduce e-invoicing , as it is required here , which will in fact lead to a saving of up to EUR 18 billion per annum for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> In the case of the proposal for a directive regarding the problem of late payment , the Late Payment Directive , work is far advanced , and this same Parliament will be able to deal with this proposal .
<en> Regarding Mr Rübig 's last question : Which executive authority would turn it down if Parliament offers it money ?
<en> However , I fear that you are not offering us any money , you are offering a budget line in which there is a zero .
<en> If you are able to offer a budget line with a great amount of additional money , please do , but I do not see that happening .
<en> Therefore , I believe that at this time it makes more sense to optimise the programmes and projects which we have in such a way that they serve to finance the Small Business Act .
<en> This applies , in particular , to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme , for which I am responsible , but it also applies to the major Structural Fund , even to the Rural Development Programme and even to the Framework Programme on Research and Development .
<en> Overall , I see substantial opportunities for making use of these programmes to promote small and medium-sized enterprises within the European Union .
<sp>
<en> To conclude the debate I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Thursday 4 December from 12 noon onwards .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Improving the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and supporting the Charter for Small Enterprises is very significant in terms of developing entrepreneurship and the economy of the European Union .
<en> This is particularly so because small and medium-sized enterprises employ over half of the citizens of the European Union and account for 99 % of enterprises in the Union as a whole .
<en> Unfortunately , however , I have many concerns relating to implementation of the Charter for Small Enterprises .
<en> In Poland , for example , there were promises of ambitious plans to lighten the administrative burden , simplify provisions and do away with redundant legislation .
<en> In fact , the situation in government offices has not changed .
<en> Entrepreneurs are still coming up against incompetent officials and unnecessary procedures .
<en> In addition , they continue to suffer from undue bureaucracy that significantly restricts entrepreneurial activity .
<en> To date , no public service Internet portals have been created .
<en> The idea of such portals is to facilitate the registration of firms , the submission of tax or customs declarations and use of collections of statistical data .
<en> All these activities could be done electronically .
<en> If we do not make our procedures more effective and do not reform government offices , we shall not succeed in fulfilling the commitments in the Charter for Small Enterprises .
<en> Consequently , we shall fail to provide proper support for SMEs .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are of key importance to the European economy , to its competitiveness and to employment levels .
<en> Providing over 100 million jobs , SMEs contribute to economic growth .
<en> In addition , they are the main source of regional development and innovation , and promote gender equality .
<en> The European Union 's SMEs still have lower productivity and a slower growth rate than those in the US , where such enterprises increase the number of jobs by an average of 60 % in the first seven years of their operation , by comparison with approximately 10-20 % in Europe .
<en> The European Charter for Small Enterprises launched by the European Commission last June introduces for the first time a comprehensive SME policy framework , granting them equal conditions and striving to improve their legal and administrative environment in the EU .
<en> An urgent question arises within this context : does the Council intend to formally support the European Charter for Small Enterprises and will Member States make a binding commitment to its implementation ?
<en> It is of vital importance to establish what steps the Council proposes to take to provide SMEs with steady access to funding at this time of financial crisis .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The more than 23 million small and medium-sized companies are rightly described as the economic backbone of the European Union .
<en> Despite their significance , SMEs cannot yet take full advantage of the internal market and in particular face bureaucratic difficulties .
<en> The Small Business Act is an important step in making SMEs more competitive and giving them the opportunity to realise their potential .
<en> The success of the ' better law-making ' principle is not the only decisive factor here .
<en> In small and medium-sized businesses , awareness of the opportunities of European integration must also be strengthened .
<en> The Exchange Programme for Entrepreneurs is a good approach in this connection .
<en> The financial measures in the Small Business Act are particularly important for the promotion of SMEs .
<en> In the light of the current difficult economic situation , it is a must that SMEs retain their employees .
<en> Simplifications in procurement , the combating of late payment or facilities for borrowing and setting up new companies are efficient instruments in this connection .
<en> Overall , the Small Business Act protects the mature European corporate structure and makes European SMEs fit for competition on international markets .

<en> Mrs Frassoni , as you have addressed me personally and - at least in the interpreted version - made an insinuation , I wish to assure you that we have been making efforts and are doing our best .

<en> You can rest assured , however , that my colleagues and I have been giving of our best .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Mr President , on 10 December we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the proclamation of the UN 's Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
<en> Article 2 of the Declaration states that : ' everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion ... ' .
<en> This document was signed by India , a country that owes so much to Mahatma Ghandi , who was a fervent advocate of the rights of the individual .
<en> Unfortunately , however , we are constantly receiving most alarming news about the persecution of Christians in India .
<en> The news includes accounts of cruel murders , assaults , rape , and the burning of homes and places of worship .
<en> The situation is particularly serious in the state of Orissa .
<en> Mr President , we did not remain indifferent to the crimes committed by terrorists in Bombay , and we must not remain indifferent either to the so-called pogroms against Christians .
<en> We must endeavour to put an end to these expressions of hatred , which are a clear case of violation of fundamental human rights , namely the right to freedom of belief and the right to life .
<sp>
<en> ( DA ) Mr President , over these few days we are celebrating this year 's Sakharov prize .
<en> It would therefore be appropriate to ask how things are going with previous recipients of the prize , for example the Kurdish / Turkish politician Leyla Zana , who received the prize in 1996 .
<en> In 2004 , she was released after ten years ' imprisonment , but last Friday , 5 December , she was once again sentenced to ten years in prison .
<en> The reason for this is that she continues to work to secure fundamental rights for the Kurds in Turkey , such as the right to speak their own language .
<en> This demonstrates , unfortunately , that the human rights situation in Turkey is not progressing , but regressing .
<en> I would therefore urge all Members to express their solidarity with our former Sakharov prize winner , Leyla Zana , and I would call on the President to present a proposal for how the European Parliament can protest to the Turkish authorities .
<sp>
<en> Mr Søndergaard , I would point out that I visited Leyla Zana in prison on another occasion .
<en> We shall continue to take action in this matter .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I feel obliged to ask for your attention and the attention of all my fellow Members and your assistance in addressing Alzheimer 's disease .
<en> This is a disease that affects the elderly and is currently making the lives of 6 million of our fellow European citizens a misery .
<en> However , it does not only make their lives a misery ; it makes the lives of 6 million families a misery , bringing the number to 25 million people , who are fighting to cope with this disease without feeling that they have any help from Europe , which could ease their plight by dealing with this scourge , which appears to be on the increase .
<en> I therefore call on all of us to ask the Commission and the governments of the Member States to make it a priority in Europe 's health programmes , so that we can free 25 million of our fellow citizens from this tragedy .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I supported the position of the rapporteur , Mr Cercas , since the organisation of working time is a crucial issue in the everyday lives of the citizens of Europe .
<2en> The massive demonstration by European unions yesterday in Strasbourg showed their commitment to better protection for workers .
<2en> Several aspects of this report caught my attention and should be defended , including , in particular , the end of the derogation to weekly working time , which is currently set at 48 hours in the European Union .
<2en> Like other European socialists , I am convinced that reconciling work and family life is essential for the people of Europe to flourish .
<2en> The Cercas report , with the social advances it contains , moves in the right direction by removing the overly liberal measures applied in some Member States , which would like to see them extended throughout the European Union .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) After four years of trying to change the Working Time Directive , the Council of Ministers succeeded in agreeing on a common position last summer .
<en> The Council 's agreement contains an opt-out option , which allows the social partners to deviate from the weekly working hours laid down in the directive .
<en> In this way , the Swedish model of collective agreements is protected .
<en> This is also fully in line with the principle of subsidiarity , the idea behind which being that decisions should be taken as near to citizens as possible .
<en> The intention of Parliament 's proposal is to exclude this opt-out option .
<en> I therefore voted against it .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of rejecting the Council common position as I consider that it does not respect the legitimate rights of workers .
<en> The European Parliament adopted a clear and meaningful position by rejecting the possibility of a 65-hour working week .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Today 's defeat suffered by the Council at the hands of the European Parliament is an important victory in the workers ' struggle .
<en> The Council has failed to push through its unacceptable proposals to amend the Working Time Directive , which would have jeopardised the victories hard won during over 100 years of labour struggle .
<en> I would particularly highlight the attempts to extend the average working week to 60 and 65 hours , to create the concept of ' inactive working time ' , which would not therefore be regarded as working time , and to attack the trade union movement .
<en> All of that has been rejected , which also marks a defeat for the Portuguese Socialist Government of José Sócrates , which abstained on the Council common position .
<en> Following today 's vote in the European Parliament , the Council 's proposal cannot enter into force .
<en> However , it can open new negotiations with Parliament , in contrast to what would have happened if the motion to reject the Council common position , tabled and defended by our Group , had been adopted .
<en> As a result , despite the important victory achieved , this has not ended the war against the Council 's proposal and certain reformist positions which appear ready to accept something in future negotiations .
<en> We will remain firm in our position of rejection and we call on workers and their trade unions to be vigilant .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted to keep the opt-out as my priority is , first and foremost , to protect West Midlands jobs and ensure that my region retains a competitive edge .
<en> I have always worked hard to protect workers but I do not feel that restricting people 's choices is the best way to achieve this .
<en> I have spoken to many workers and SME owners for whom the downturn is causing job losses and business failures ; they have asked me to retain their choice .
<en> In my experience , restricting peoples ' overtime only favours those that can afford to weather the storm and it is important that we give people the means to support their families .
<en> There are safeguards in place in the common position to ensure that workers are not being exploited .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr Mitchell , price stability is laid down in the Treaty as the principal mandate .
<2en> The European Central Bank 's main mandate is to keep prices stable .
<2en> Once this principal mandate or objective has been achieved , or in so far as it is achieved , the mandate is to ensure that monetary policy is coordinated with the rest of the economic policy objectives .
<2en> That is something that the ECB itself and the other European institutions must ensure .
<2en> What does the ECB mean by price stability ?
<2en> I believe it defined it very clearly back in 2003 , if I am not mistaken .
<2en> It means inflation below 2 % but very close to 2 % over the medium term .
<2en> Over all these years , from 1999 until now , meeting this target of just below 2 % has meant trying to keep inflation down .
<2en> Next year , if the forecasts are right , price stability may be interpreted for the first time as trying to keep up to 2 % without going over it , because we will probably be living in a situation in which not only month-on-month inflation but perhaps even inflation forecasts for the medium term are dropping below 2 % .
<2en> The mandate will continue to be the same , however .
<2en> The instruments used and the methods of achieving the objective will be different , of course , but that will continue to be the objective .
<2en> The second area of activity or set of actions of any central bank and , of course , of the European Central Bank , is to provide liquidity .
<2en> This is extremely important at the present moment .
<2en> I think the ECB is doing what is has to do , but it makes no secret of the fact - it says so quite openly - that it provides liquidity in the mornings , but normally , before shutting up shop at the end of the day , it receives liquidity from those financial institutions that have not used that liquidity for their credit operations .
<2en> That has now given rise to a debate : the newspapers these days are carrying statements by the ECB 's Vice-President , Mr Papademos , and by some other executives to the effect that the bank is discussing how it should use the necessary instruments to ensure that this provision of liquidity is effective and not simply a circular operation which ends up returning the money each afternoon to the place it came from that morning .
<2en> I now come to the second question , on the difference .
<2en> In some EU Member States outside the euro area , inflation is higher than in the vast majority of the countries within the euro area .
<2en> If you look at the note that Eurostat circulated this morning on inflation at the end of November , you will see that most EU countries outside the euro area have a higher inflation rate than the country with the highest inflation within the euro area .
<2en> Therefore , there is more inflation outside the euro area at the moment , to a large extent because there are countries outside the area that are going through a rapid convergence process , and where there is greater inflationary pressure due to a series of more intense effects of the use of energy , greater dependence on foreign energy sources that have risen in price , or the ' Balassa-Samuelson effect ' , in technical jargon .
<2en> In a sector-by-sector comparison , inflation is clearly higher in the services sector .
<2en> Despite the very rapid fall in year-on-year inflation in recent months , you will see that inflation in the services sector has remained fairly constant at 2.5-2.6 % .
<2en> Inflation in the food products , processed foods and industrial goods sectors has fluctuated much more for the reasons that I outlined before in my reply to Mr Medina Ortega .
<2en> The services sector , however , has stayed at an inflation rate that is above the price stability target , which is to remain below 2 % .
<2en> Even so , its rate is close to 2 % .
<2en> Subject : Organisation of economic governance in the EU
<2en> In terms of the intensity and fully binding nature of regulation , an asymmetry exists between full monetary union and an economic union which remains incomplete .
<2en> In the Commission 's view , what strategic direction should be followed in the organisation of the EU 's economic governance in order to remedy this asymmetry ?
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , Mr Papastamkos is asking about governance in the euro area .
<2en> I have just been talking about governance in the monetary pillar of Economic and Monetary Union , the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks .
<2en> Quite frankly , I think it is working very well .
<2en> I think it is a success .
<2en> Governance in the other pillar , the economic pillar of Economic and Monetary Union , does work , but it still has a long way to go .
<2en> The coordination of fiscal and budgetary policies is working , and I think that so far , since the 2005 review , the Stability and Growth Pact and the budgetary coordination that is implicit in the implementation of the pact have worked very well .
<2en> We are now being tested very severely because , as a result of the economic slowdown and the fiscal stimulus measures , plus the packages to support the financial system , public finances are under extreme pressure and the Stability and Growth Pact has to be implemented in a very difficult situation .
<2en> It has to be implemented with the flexibility that it possesses , while maintaining and complying with the rules of the pact , and that will be a major test .
<2en> There is a second factor that is also analysed in our report on the first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union .
<2en> Looking beyond the coordination of our fiscal and budgetary policies , I believe it is necessary to improve the coordination of our macroeconomic policies .
<2en> There are highly significant macroeconomic imbalances in some countries , including Hungary and Latvia , which are currently having major difficulties with their balances of payments and require substantial financial support from us , from the monetary fund .
<2en> That indicates that there have been cumulative imbalances that we have been unable to correct in time through our coordination system .
<2en> These are countries outside the Economic and Monetary Union , in its third stage with the euro .
<2en> Even within the euro area , however , there are divergences in current account deficits and the evolution of unit labour costs .
<2en> In my view , they need much more effective coordination than we have succeeded in providing so far , despite the efforts of the Euro Group to do so .
<2en> I think the Euro Group has been working much better since the Prime Minister of Luxembourg , Jean-Claude Juncker , took over as President in 2005 and established a stable presidency .
<2en> There is still a long way to go , however , in terms of the internal coordination of macroeconomic policies or of certain structural reforms , which go beyond budgetary coordination , and clearly a long way to go in terms of external coordination .
<2en> I believe the euro as a currency is sufficiently important to us and to the rest of the world for us not to allow ourselves the luxury of failing to ensure that the interests , positions and priorities of the euro in the euro area countries are represented in multilateral forums and institutions in a coherent , consistent and integrated manner .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , my thanks to the Commissioner for his reply .
<en> I welcome the fact that you mentioned that economic governance still has a long way to go and that you confirmed the asymmetry between a strict monetary construct and relaxed , incomplete , imperfect economic governance .
<en> I should like to ask the Commissioner :
<en> With your hand on your heart , from your experience to date and taking account of the recent financial crisis and the fact that it has turned into an economic crisis , if we were to revise the Treaty today , what proposals would you make in terms of institutional foundations for promoting economic governance in the European Union ?

<2en> I think I can answer that very quickly , so as not to repeat some of the points I mentioned in my previous answer .
<2en> My ideas on what needs to be done are reflected in the report on the first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union and in the more political communication that the Commission adopted at my initiative and that we have been debating here in Parliament and within the Council .
<2en> We need better coordination of fiscal and budgetary policies , not only for the short term , but also for the medium and long terms ; we need coordination - which so far has been very weak - of non-fiscal macroeconomic policies , to improve the ability of the euro area economies to adjust themselves and to improve the preparation of countries aiming to join the euro area in the next few years , since more and more are applying .
<2en> We need coordination on the basis of a clear , precise strategy , with explicit priorities and a single voice outside the euro area , and we need governance that consists of continuing to make the Euro Group work more effectively , along the lines of what we have been doing under Mr Juncker 's presidency since 1 January 2005 .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) I very much appreciate your opinions .
<en> I should like to hear your opinion on the following : in my view , the economic and monetary organisation of the EU will only become complete when the common area of freedom , security and justice is established .
<en> In other words , we need common laws that are the same for all and we need the courts to apply these laws in the same way throughout the Union .
<en> However , we are far from establishing a common area of freedom , security and especially justice .
<en> My question is as follows : if , for any reason , the Treaty of Lisbon does not enter into force , which we should not like to see , do you feel that this would jeopardise the process of European integration , particularly Economic and Monetary Union ?

<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , we have all fought for the closure of Guantánamo and we all welcome President Obama 's decision to close this prison of shame .
<en> Now , we should not have to be asked about accepting Guantánamo detainees .
<en> As Europeans , faithful to the values of defending human rights , we have to face up to our responsibilities , our duty to accept these ex-detainees .
<en> There have been reports , and I am addressing the Council here , there have been reports in the press that some Member States are not keen on receiving them .
<en> I would therefore call on the Council and , in particular , on any reticent Member States , to accept the arrival of these detainees on their territories .
<en> I would also say to you , ladies and gentlemen , that the worst we could do would be to let the boost given by the closure of Guantánamo evaporate because Europe was not prepared to stand up and be counted .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , given that many EU Member States were complicit in the process of extraordinary rendition , I believe that EU countries , including Ireland , have a collective responsibility to accept a certain number of low-risk Guantánamo detainees from the US for resettlement within the EU .
<en> Irish Minister for Justice , Dermot Ahern , has made such an acceptance conditional on getting EU approval , but it is not necessary for Ireland to wait for an EU directive to settle Guantánamo detainees .
<en> We can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the US , as Portugal has done .
<en> The Irish Government Ministers for Justice and Foreign Affairs have not been singing from the same hymn sheet on this matter , with Minister Ahern being seemingly unprepared to go as far as Minister Martin regarding detainee settlement .
<en> Cohesive leadership is now needed from the Irish Government in this regard .
<en> In a spirit of transatlantic cooperation and to participate in the fight against international terrorism , Ireland should play its part to assist the new US Administration in closing Guantánamo .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the EU has been asking for the closure of Guantánamo for a long time .
<en> Today that decision has been taken by the new US Administration , and EU countries are expected to show solidarity by taking over those prisoners .
<en> However , some think that such solidarity should be demonstrated primarily by the countries mentioned before in the press as hosting secret CIA detention centres .
<en> I would like to stress once more the fact that such allegations have not been supported by evidence , either when they were made or since then .
<en> That is also valid for Mr Mate , who failed to produce the evidence supporting his accusations in this very House .
<en> Moreover , internal investigations have not supported the accusations either .
<en> Exploiting people 's potential lack of memory that such evidence was not produced then does not make it evidence today .
<en> At the most , it is simply cynical manipulation for obscure purposes .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Mr President , the whole world welcomes Barack Obama 's plan to close Guantánamo , because it is a symbol of the merciless treatment of people - ruthless terrorists though they may be , or suspected of the gravest crimes .
<en> Some of them have not even been charged and duly tried .
<en> Obama made a popular gesture and is now deciding what to do with them .
<en> He should , above all , persuade Congress to change the law so that the prisoners can be transferred to US soil and some can be given a new identity .
<en> It is an extremely hot potato : after release , 60 Guantánamo prisoners returned to terrorist activity , and therefore each case should be examined individually .
<en> The Czech Presidency 's negotiations on a solution for Guantánamo are an opportunity to emphasise that dialogue between the United States , Europe and Cuba on changes on the totalitarian ' island of freedom ' begins with human rights , and not only the human rights of prisoners at the American base .
<en> Above all , this dialogue should entail the release of political prisoners in Cuba , and freedom of speech and movement for innocent Cuban citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) We find it obvious that we should applaud President Obama 's decision : the decision to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay , to ban torture and illegal interrogations , and to suspend the military trials .
<en> I can , however , assure my fellow Member , who is no longer present , that Portugal and the Socialist Government of Portugal do not feel guilty .
<en> The Socialist Government of Portugal did not collaborate with the Bush Administration : quite the contrary .
<en> The Portuguese Administration - the Portuguese Government - through the initiative of Minister Amado , has right now opened up the possibility and obligation for the European Union and other democratic countries to accept and receive Guantánamo Bay prisoners who have not been charged .
<en> This is what is truly important and this is what must be highlighted as an example for other EU Member States to follow .
<en> It is also important for the resolution to be adopted tomorrow by all the parties that make up this House , so that unity might lend the decision more force .

<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , I was unsure as to how to vote on Mrs Schaldemose 's report on the integrity of online gambling and for what reason .
<en> So I asked my pensioners .
<en> Yesterday I met a pensioner named Ugo Rossi , a retired craftsman .
<en> He told me : ' Oh , online gambling , I have lost EUR 10 000 ' .
<en> A little later I met a retired lady , Lucia Annone .
<en> She told me : ' Do not talk to me about online gambling , I have lost EUR 100 000 ' .
<en> I decided , however , how to vote when even my mother , who is 94 , said to me : ' You gave me a computer and I have lost my entire pension for March 2009 , EUR 450 ' .
<en> So no , Mr President , at that point , I decided that , in order to protest against gambling and so that it is eradicated throughout Europe , I had to vote against this report for that reason .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , in the case of online gambling , there must be clear and unambiguous laws that serve to limit , control and account for the nearly EUR 3 billion in annual gross revenue realised by the gambling industry .
<en> However , according to Mrs Schaldemose , that EUR 3 billion is only 5 % of the total gambling market in the European Union .
<en> Therefore , the importance and influence of this industry is obvious - as are its dangers .
<en> Gambling is often correctly associated with crime at international level , and cross-border gambling rings which are much easier to run via the Internet jeopardise the laws of various nations and harbour risks to national sovereignty .
<en> It is also important to note the negative effects on health associated with gambling .
<en> As a medical doctor , I am well aware of the damaging characteristics of obsessive or addictive gambling .
<en> These are not issues that the European Parliament can underestimate .
<en> When it comes to tackling fraud , criminal behaviour and financial and medical issues that correspond to online gambling , I call on the European Parliament to vote repeatedly on better and better solutions in future .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted in the same way as Mr Busuttil on this particular report , and was concerned at the level of argument .
<en> In fact , the bilge that was coming up in this debate was unbelievable , exemplified by my colleague who has just left , Mr Fatuzzo .
<en> It is complete rubbish to say that , because three old people lose some money in a voluntary way , then we have got to ban online gambling across a continent .
<en> This debate showed up many national differences , and there was no honesty in the debate at all .
<en> The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs commissioned a study which showed that online gaming had no more damaging effect than ordinary gaming in a place run by a national lottery .
<en> There was one reasonable part , which was the part about fair return to guarantee integrity in sport .
<en> Alas , this debate has driven the online gamblers and the sporting governing bodies further apart than they have ever been before , rather than drawing them together to try and work out a common solution .
<en> It has absolutely shown the need for some forum where those two groups can come together and discuss this matter .
<en> Alas , this is obviously not that place .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , we all know that gambling is a very emotive subject .
<en> You only have to listen to the speeches that have been made before me .
<en> There are those who believe that gambling is the work of the devil and that those who take part deserve to be cast into hellfire and deserve all the losses they have on this earth and in the afterlife .
<en> Now that is an extreme view , granted , but if you were to look at some of the language used in this report - the issues of a transparent sector that safeguards the public and consumer interests , tackling fraud and other criminal behaviour , prevention of consumer detriment - those same emotions are expressed , albeit in a far more toned-down way , in this report when it comes to online gambling .
<en> However , consider the hypocrisy of this report .
<en> It talks about online gambling in this negative and detrimental way , but it says nothing about the state monopolies that are hiding behind the emotive language to continue to drive out private innovative competitors .
<en> Let us be honest in this debate as to what it is all about .
<en> It is about keeping state monopolies , and we know where that leads to : it leads down the road to serfdom .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , quality food is not an aspiration in Europe : it must continue as a reality .
<en> But its production requires a fair and competitive return .
<en> Our agricultural producers must be able to earn enough to cover the extra cost generated by EU food safety , animal welfare and environmental requirements .
<en> When faced with cheap and inferior imports , the competitive advantage that quality should give is often not enough : hence the role that needs to be played by CAP funding in keeping our producers competitive .
<en> That has to be the quid pro quo for meeting the high costs imposed by EU regulation .
<en> I also deplore the continuing exploitation of producers by the major distributors who now dominate the European food markets .
<en> Their abuse of their position of dominance continues , with producers exploited at every turn , even to the point of having to pay for their promotions .

<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , in this time of economic crisis , the European Parliament should play a guard dog role , particularly when it comes to preventing protectionism .
<en> We have established the internal market , which has brought us much prosperity , together .
<en> Not only in western Europe , but also in central Europe , have countries enjoyed the full benefits of this .
<en> We should not let these achievements slip out of our hands in the face of any old headwind .
<en> We in the European Parliament should oppose proposals such as those surrounding the support of the French automotive industry , which could adversely affect other European countries .
<en> Parliament should also play a guard dog role when it comes to the strength of the euro .
<en> We cannot accept that countries should run up national debts without limitation .
<en> In Europe , we agreed to the so-called Stability and Growth Pact .
<en> We know that as a result of the financial crisis , we should temporarily offer more scope for supporting the banks .
<en> This should be an exception , though .
<en> There is no need to provide any structural support to other sectors in the economy .
<en> Member States do not have the funds to do this , and if they were to borrow with Eurobonds , future generations would be saddled with the burden of debt and the euro would become weak .
<en> I am opposed to this .
<en> In short , we should be a guard dog when it comes to fighting protectionism and protecting the value of the euro .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , in my short contribution today , I would like to focus on an important area which I hope will be successfully discussed and resolved at the European Council meeting , and that is the area of energy policy .
<en> We all know that the European Union needs to strengthen its energy security and independence and to strengthen its energy infrastructure which means linking up and extending oil pipelines , gas pipelines and power lines between individual states and regions .
<en> We also need to increase our reserves of oil and natural gas .
<en> We want to increase the share of renewables , to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and products , and to increase investment in research and in measures for mitigating the effects of climate change .
<en> I firmly believe that the measures and investments that must be introduced in the area of energy policy cannot only solve our energy and climate problems but can also have a very positive and powerful effect at a time of economic crisis by kick-starting economic growth and increasing employment .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the efforts made by the European institutions in outlining the measures for coordinated actions by Member States and the Commission in dealing with the economic crisis .
<en> As is already well known , the European Union 's Cohesion Policy is making an important contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan and is the Community 's largest source of investments in the real economy .
<en> As a gesture in recognition of these efforts , the European Parliament supports the amendments to the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund , in order to simplify and speed up financial management of EU funds .
<en> I hope that the beneficiaries will gain from this simplification , those whom the funds are actually targeted at .
<en> This is particularly important for the European Union 's poorer Member States .
<en> One important task which still faces Member States is to guarantee the necessary funding so that EU resources are spent as intended .
<en> Without breaching the rules on free competition and the standards of good management , Member States should use the simplified procedures for funding projects .
<en> Thank you for your attention .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , it is clear that the European aspect of the economic recovery plan and its financial backing is very negligible compared to the efforts of the Member States .
<en> I hope , however , that the Council will adopt a plan to support energy interconnections between countries so that a future gas crisis will be mitigated in its effects .
<en> However , solidarity could be expressed by making more flexible the criteria for ERM2 , the eurozone and the adoption of the euro for those countries wanting to join .
<en> It is clear that Member States that now have to make great efforts to maintain a stable currency exchange rate need more support to be able to pass all the necessary steps to become members of the eurozone and thus prevent the effects of the economic crisis .
<en> I hope that will be one of the decisions taken in the near future , bearing in mind that there is already flexibility for the existing Members .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) While I basically agree with the European Economic Recovery Plan , I would like to draw attention to two matters : the issuing of Eurobonds and expansion of the eurozone .
<en> The issuing of Eurobonds is neither an appropriate instrument to strengthen the eurozone , nor is the timing right in a Europe which is affected by the financial , economic and social crisis .
<en> We have 16 eurozone members , whose economies will receive support , but what about the other 11 countries ?
<en> It is proposed that we should only allow the purchase of Eurobonds with Swedish and Danish Crowns .
<en> Where would this leave the new Member States which , for many objective reasons , are not in the eurozone ?
<en> What is the cost of borrowing they would have to pay ?
<en> Lithuania was not allowed to introduce the Euro because inflation was 0.07 % above the indicator 's maximum limit , although in 10 years , not a single eurozone member has met all the indicators .
<en> The Lithuanian Litas has already been pegged to the euro for 4 years .
<en> Is it not time to look more creatively at changes in the world and expand the eurozone , thus making it easier for the EU to exit the crisis ?
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The full impact of the financial crisis which started in the US is now being felt in the real economy .
<2en> The experts do not agree on the best response to this crisis and the best way of stimulating the economy in order to keep the unemployment figures in check .
<2en> However , even before the financial crisis , the situation on the labour market did not look at all bright .
<2en> More and more people were being forced into part-time and short-time work and state-supported jobs were being constantly cut back .
<2en> For some time , increasing numbers of people have been living below the poverty line , despite being in work .
<2en> In light of the gloomy forecasts about the economy , it is likely that the number of people in full-time employment will continue to fall and , at some point , that part-time workers will also lose their jobs .
<2en> We must do everything we can to avoid mass unemployment .
<2en> It is by no means certain that the measures presented in this report are suitable or satisfactory in this respect .
<2en> For this reason , I have voted against the report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against Mr Andersson 's report .
<2en> Although , in fact , on the one hand , I believe that we must join forces to reverse the trend towards radical restructuring , to prevent job losses and to stop further cuts in wages and social security benefits , on the other hand , I feel that the measures laid down by the Commission are , for the most part , not enough to guarantee sufficient cover and protection for the European Union 's social and employment structure .
<sp>
<2en> The current economic crisis has , and will have in the near future too , repercussions on the employment market .
<2en> I voted in favour of the draft European Parliament legislative resolution on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States because I join the rapporteur in supporting the Commission 's position , which proposed ( as set out in the Annex to Council Decision 2008 / 618 / EC of 15 July 2008 ) that employment policies are maintained for 2009 .
<2en> According to the Commission , this approach will create a sound framework capable of tackling the economic and financial crisis as well as continuing structural reform .
<sp>
<2en> The current crisis is more than just an economic and financial crisis .
<2en> It is , above all , a crisis of confidence .
<2en> Its most dramatic sign is the high level of unemployment .
<2en> However , unemployment does not only mean a loss of income , but also a loss of confidence in ourselves and in others .
<2en> To restore this confidence , we need to set out a very clear medium-term strategy .
<2en> In this respect , the role of political leaders is decisive , due to the signals and messages that they convey .
<2en> Prudence , security , speaking the truth , and resisting easy propaganda on impracticable targets and self-praise are some of the good practices that could help restore confidence .
<2en> On the other hand , we need to create jobs and , to do this , the conditions must exist for investment by companies .
<2en> We must act quickly because , if nothing is done in this respect , the financing problems being faced by those countries with the largest deficits in the eurozone will lead to the deepening of the recession , a continual rise in unemployment and the loss of income for companies and families .
<2en> That is why I supported Mr Andersson 's report , which proposes maintaining guidelines for employment policies in 2009 .
<sp>
<2en> A further extension or , to put it another way , a further postponement of the enshrined right of all Members to speak in Parliament in their own language and for all documents to be drawn up in the official languages is neither comprehensible nor acceptable .
<2en> A number of years have already passed since the accession of certain countries for which the limitation on the use of their language remains , in particular , Ireland and the Czech Republic , without the required linguists having been found .
<2en> The justification put forward is vague and inconsistent , but financial priority has not been given to their training , which leads us to distrust the intentions .
<2en> We cannot accept any threat to the inalienable right to cultural and linguistic diversity in the EU , which would also affect Portuguese .
<2en> We cannot accept this discrimination .
<2en> Once again , we state our determination to protect the cultural identity of each Member State and of all national languages as working languages .
<2en> In this respect , our vote can only be against this decision .
<2en> Ultimately , this marks the transposition to the cultural and linguistic level of the EU 's budgetary policies , which give priority to investment in arms instead of valuing culture and protecting employment .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I abstained - along with the British Conservative delegation - on the Lambsdorff report on the priorities for the UN General Assembly 64th session .
<en> My party strongly supports the work of the UN , although accepting it is an imperfect organisation in need of reform .
<en> However , there were a number of issues mentioned in this report where British Conservatives disagree strongly , such as the role of the ICC and the abolition of the Security Council permanent seats of the UK and France , to be replaced by a single permanent seat for the European Union .
<en> We also believe the application of the death penalty on adults is an issue for an individual Member 's conscience and we do not have a party political line on this .
<en> So we abstained overall .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I want to make a point on Ms Martens ' report .
<en> Firstly , let me say that the Lisbon Treaty is not a train wreck and it is nonsense to be saying that .
<en> Twenty-six of the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union will ratify or have ratified it , and that includes the British Parliament .
<en> It is a pity that British Members do not respect their own parliament in some of the comments they are making here .
<en> The Irish people expressed certain concerns about some issues , and the Irish Government and Parliament are seeking clarification on those .
<en> If we get those clarifications and the people vote ' yes ' in a second referendum later this year , will they come in here with their leprechaun hats and perform in the same outrageous manner that they did at the previous one ?
<en> Leave Irish business to Ireland .
<en> We do not need any assistance in this from people it took us 700 years to get out of our country !
<en> Concerning the Lisbon Treaty , let me say that the population of the European Union will be 6 % of the world 's population within the next generation .
<en> China and all of those countries will be very powerful .
<sp>
<en> - ( CS ) Mr President , I would like to explain why I refrained from voting on the Hutchinson report .
<en> As a member of the ACP-EU Assembly I agree that development aid is not always effective .
<en> It is not well coordinated and it has high administrative costs .
<en> The rapporteur says that partner countries do not always identify with development strategy but that state aid is the only effective instrument - and here I agree - although it should of course be more predictable .
<en> I firmly believe that we must first and foremost harmonise priorities with other providers of financial assistance such as the US and countries which support their former colonies .
<en> The rapporteur has also underestimated the impact of China 's investment policy on developing countries .
<en> This policy does not respect either millennium development goals or other goals , but respects solely and exclusively Chinese commercial interests .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I want to congratulate my colleague Mr Hutchinson on the excellent report he has written on a very important subject .
<en> The Commission and the European Union give a vast quantity of money to developing countries , the majority of which to Africa .
<en> About 50 % of Africans still live on less than USD 1 a day and 75 % of aid victims all over the world come from Africa .
<en> Given these appalling statistics it is right that we should give support to Africa , to provide clean drinking water and allow the African population to develop sustainably .
<en> However , when we give money to African governments , as the Commission now does under something called ' budgetary support ' , we should also insist that budgetary support given to African countries be scrutinised by their own parliaments in a very rigorous way and that the financial agreements signed between the Commission and the African nations are open to public scrutiny and transparency in the national parliaments of African countries and the ACP countries .
<en> This is a very important point to make in order to safeguard European taxpayers ' money .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , all of us in this Chamber are in favour of the arts and of promoting the arts and education in our respective countries .
<en> I hope that nobody would argue against that .
<en> However , the problem with this report is that , once again , it is calling for an EU perspective , and that is not appropriate .
<en> The diversity of the European Union is that all the different nation states have different cultures , different histories and different backgrounds , and it therefore seems to me important that arts and education should be a matter for determination at national level .
<en> This is not an area for interference by the European Union or the European Parliament .
<en> ' Let a thousand flowers bloom ' was , I think , the great phrase .
<en> Well , let 27 flowers - at least - bloom in the European Union , but let them bloom separately .
<en> I believe that , if we do that , they will flourish far better and live far longer .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best kind of active dialogue with European citizens is one based on listening to what they say in democratic votes .
<en> There is a great irony in this Parliament adopting this report whilst , at the same time , completely ignoring some of the democratic decisions that have been taken in Member States .
<en> No wonder the European Union is so unpopular in my constituency of North-East England and elsewhere in Europe .
<en> Its idea of democratic dialogue is only one way : the EU does not listen to what people have to say and only tells them what they can think and how they can vote .
<en> Looking back over the past 10 years , France , the Netherlands and now Ireland - twice - have all voted to put the brakes on greater European integration , and yet the EU has completely ignored their opinions .
<en> By seeking to listen only to those EU-funded NGOs , how can that be reflective of popular voter opinion ?
<en> The best kind of dialogue with citizens is to listen to what they say in free democratic votes and referendums .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I do think there is a misconception when we talk about active dialogue with citizens on Europe , because we often confuse dialogue with citizens with dialogue with civil society .
<en> We often confuse dialogue with citizens with dialogue with organisations either wholly or partly funded by the Commission .
<en> In effect , we have EU institutions talking to organisations funded by the Commission , which , in the end , means by taxpayers ' money .
<en> So , when we actually give citizens the right to have their say - as we did on the Constitution in France and the Netherlands and on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland - and they say ' no ' , what do we do ?
<en> We completely ignore the result of the vote !
<en> When the people have said ' no ' , dialogue does not mean making them vote again and again and again until you get the result you want .
<en> That is not dialogue .
<en> That is an abdication of democracy .
<en> It is time that we genuinely engaged in active dialogue with citizens .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , after five years in this House , there is little in reports that can surprise one .
<en> But I do have to say that I was staggered by the sheer arrogance of aspects of this report and the calculated insult to those who dare not to roll over in sycophantic endorsement of the European project .
<en> To say in this report -as it does - that the less educated are more likely to oppose further European integration is an audacious insult and arrogance of unbelievable proportions .
<en> The truth is that those who bothered to read the EU Constitution or the Lisbon Treaty and educate themselves about it are exactly the people more likely to vote against .
<en> Those more likely to vote for it are those - like Commissioners - who never even bothered to read the documents and simply accept the propaganda .
<en> So I do reject the insult of this report .
<en> Could I also say , in response to Mr Mitchell 's first outburst - his Republican outburst about getting rid of all the British out of the island of Ireland over 700 years - that he should be glad they did not entirely succeed because he did need the help of some British subjects from Northern Ireland to attain the rugby victory in the Six Nations .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted for this reluctantly , not because of the nonsense that has just come from the other side of the House , but because I share the concerns of the rapporteur , Mr Hegyi .
<en> This report has been really watered down by those in this House who do not want to have active dialogue with the citizens of Europe .
<en> For me , active dialogue does not mean glossy brochures , and I do believe that the Commission has failed in this area .
<en> It has failed to actively engage and connect with the citizens .
<en> It has failed to get across a greater understanding of how the work that is being done at EU level is addressing many of the real issues that affect citizens ' everyday lives .
<en> I hope that , as a result of this report , it will revisit it and come up with some more imaginative ways of addressing this issue .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I welcome this report because it raises issues that need discussion .
<en> I particularly endorse the sentiments of the rapporteur that rural development measures should not drain resources intended for direct payments to farmers .
<en> Hence I join in questioning whether rural development funding should be linked to the common agricultural policy at all , as this inevitably leads to depriving farmers of previous methods of funding .
<en> Whereas , if it were instead an inherent part of cohesion funding , there would not be that opportunity to poach farming funds .
<en> Thus I welcome the declaration in the report that the population employed in agriculture should be the main focus of support measures under rural development policy .
<en> That balance has been distorted in many rural development programmes , including those affecting my region of Northern Ireland .

<en> . - ( RO ) Communism is a deceitful philosophy .
<en> In theory , it talks about well-being , equality and respect for human rights , while in practice , it has meant lies , discrimination , hatred and even crime .
<en> Communism must be condemned with all the means at our disposal .
<en> This was done in Romania in 2006 through the words of the country 's president , as a result of a report compiled by a presidential commission set up for this purpose .
<en> Communism nullifies everything that stands for liberty and makes people dependent on a system .
<en> Anyone who has never lived under Communism cannot understand how much a person 's life and way of thinking can be affected by a totalitarian system .
<en> If I could turn back the clock , I would make those who have lived their whole lives under capitalism , but yearn for Communism , live in the Romania of the 1980s .
<en> In Romania the Communist regime was imposed with the help of Russian troops , at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives lost in labour camps and prisons .
<en> With their only crime being not to submit to the totalitarian system , politicians , intellectuals , peasants , representatives of different religious denominations and , in general , citizens who were model members of the community disappeared .
<en> While the major problems caused by a bankrupt economic system can be resolved through adequate measures , human beings need time to forget , forgive and adapt to a new way of life , even if it is incomparably better .
<en> Democracy has provided freedom of thought , expression and movement .
<en> It must also provide security for tomorrow .
<en> There is no difference between poverty caused by the lack of material goods and poverty caused by a lack of resources for buying goods .
<en> The day when we successfully get rid of poverty , the spectre of Communism will disappear for good .
<en> Fellow Members , Romania and the other countries in Eastern Europe ended up under this system as a result of the decisions made by the world 's leaders , only one of whom was a Communist .
<en> The remainder represented democratic systems .
<en> Do not forget this historical truth when evaluating , assessing or deciding on the current situation or on the future of the former Communist states , whether members of the European Union or not .

<en> - ( SL ) I note with regret that none of the former Communist countries has yet fully investigated and recognised the crimes of Communism in the period following the Second World War .
<en> Because these regimes were in power for decades after the war , they managed to destroy most of the evidence .
<en> This is why the criminals , or the perpetrators , have not even been named , let alone convicted .
<en> History was written by the victors .
<en> The European Union must call upon all of the countries which were previously ruled by Communist regimes to enable their historians to carry out research and include the whole truth about the post-war era in school textbooks .
<en> They should also write about the culpability of the Western allied forces which returned or extradited exiles into the hands of the Communists .
<en> The European Union should also call upon all of the Member States to consider renaming those streets and squares which are named after controversial heroes , such as Tito in Yugoslavia , who were accountable for many post-war killings , by virtue of their roles at the time .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Madam President , when I hear in this Chamber that the Communists are not prepared to hang their heads , despite the tens of millions of victims of the construction of the White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal , the millions of people deported to Siberia from many nations ( including Russians , but the Poles alone have to be counted in millions ) , and the sentencing of entire nations to death , for example the Crimean Tartars , I am astounded and outraged .
<en> Cavalry Captain Pilecki , who went into Auschwitz as a volunteer , and was later also imprisoned by the Communists , told his wife ' Auschwitz was only a game ' .
<en> My country was affected by both totalitarian systems , and the wounds are still healing today .
<en> No such system has the right to exist .
<en> We should honour those who fought against totalitarianism , and we should honour the memory of the victims .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Madam President , the European Community must make every effort to keep alive the memory of heroes and not to allow the trivialisation of totalitarian crimes .
<en> The fate of those who resisted , of those who , like Cavalry Captain Pilecki , were murdered , should always be in our minds , especially because the idea of European integration arose among people opposed to Nazism and Communism .
<en> Furthermore , it was this idea which prevented future conflicts and the emergence of totalitarian regimes after the end of the War .
<en> The establishment of an International Day of the Heroes of the Fight Against Totalitarianism would be a step in the direction of a common understanding of 20th-century European history and part of the common fight against mutual prejudice and ignorance concerning historical facts .
<en> Keeping the crimes of totalitarian regimes - Nazi and Communist - in the minds of Europeans can make us hope that our continent will never again be the scene of such tragic events .
<sp>
<en> - Madam President , there is a further dimension to this debate .
<en> It is not only a united Europe that needs urgently to look at the entirety of the past , but the same is particularly true of the European Left .
<en> Without a thorough scrutiny of its past , the Left in some of the former Communist states is obliged - compels itself - to live with a false past , a past from which all sorts of painful events are screened out .
<en> This further forces the Left to protect this false past and thereby its democratic credibility is eroded .
<en> Seeing as the Western Left fully accepts this unreconstructed post-Communist Left as a legitimate partner , it too finds itself obliged to defend an indefensible past .
<en> Consequently , its own commitment to democracy is , to that extent , weakened .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is voting time .
<en> ( For details of the outcome of the votes : see Minutes )
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , just a short aside , as Members are still taking their seats .
<en> We changed the rules of procedure because too much time was being spent on fruitless debates , and we decided not to hold a debate on the Auken report .
<en> We have wasted a good half hour doing nothing , which we could have employed much better by debating a text that is of great importance to citizens .
<sp>
<en> Your comment will be passed on to the competent bodies .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to propose an oral amendment to the effect that , in points 5 , 8 and 16 , the word ' legal ' should be deleted , as it gives the impression that children who are not registered , in other words involved in a current asylum procedure , could be excluded from the education programmes .
<en> We wish to protest against this .
<en> I move that the word ' legal ' be deleted since every child has the right to education if he or she is registered in a country .
<sp>
<en> If there are no objections to what Mrs Prets has proposed , we will , of course , check the text once more very carefully on this basis .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I am not sure if the interpretation missed it .
<en> I heard paragraphs 5 and 16 ; paragraph 8 also states that only the children of ' legal ' migrants would receive education .
<en> I want the word deleted there as well .
<en> ( Parliament did not agree to accept the oral amendments )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DA ) The Danish Liberal Party 's MEPs have voted against this report .
<en> We are in favour of the free movement of workers and of ensuring that the Member States comply with the directive .
<en> However , we are opposed to the possibility of legalising unlawful residence through marriage to a migrant worker , as reflected in the Metock ruling .
<en> Member States must , through their administration , have a real possibility of ensuring that rules concerning free movement are not abused for the purpose of circumventing the legislation governing aliens .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against Mrs Vălean 's report on the application of Directive 2004 / 38 / EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States .
<2en> I do not agree with the point where the Member States are requested to adopt the same format of personal identity documents for their own nationals and for European Union citizens from other Member States , notwithstanding the noticeable differences within the documents .
<2en> I find this solution to be pointless and superficial .
<sp>
<2en> In the light of Article 18 of the EC Treaty , every citizen has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States .
<2en> Directive 2004 / 38 / EC defines in detail the legal possibilities for movement within the EU 's borders by citizens , their close family or a legally-documented partner .
<2en> Free movement should , however , be considered together with regulations concerning free movement of workers and freedom to provide services .
<2en> As we all know , four EU Member States still have not opened their labour markets to workers from the countries which acceded in 2004 .
<2en> As many as 11 EU Member States continue to apply restrictions on their labour markets to citizens of Rumania and Bulgaria .
<2en> I think that this situation has a negative influence , and not only on the process of integration .
<2en> We should strive to remove existing barriers as soon as possible .
<2en> In accordance with Article 20 of the Treaty , every citizen shall , within the territory of a third country in which the Member State of which he is a national is not represented , be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State , on the same conditions as the nationals of that State .
<2en> The measures which have been announced concerning the strengthening of consular protection in third countries should be implemented as soon as possible , and negotiations with third countries on the lifting of visa requirements should be continued .
<sp>
<2en> Mrs Gacek 's report brings to the fore one important aspect : when the European Union was expanded , a considerable increase was noted in the number of European citizens resident outside their state of origin in a context where European citizenship complements the citizenship of Member States , each of which is responsible for regulating this aspect .
<2en> In spite of the active involvement of citizens in initiating legislative proposals and in attempting to make the Community 's legislative system more transparent , Europeans are still faced with a number of problems linked to the breach of and non-compliance with people 's right to move to and reside where they want on the territory of Member States .
<2en> The discrepancies noted between Member States on regulating a compulsory visa requirement or on exercising the right to vote in both their country of origin and country of adoption raise a question mark over the equality of rights among all European citizens .
<2en> For this reason , I consider that Member States must take all necessary measures to transpose effectively the norms intended to harmonise European citizens ' rights .
<2en> In this specific case , we must bear in mind that the starting point is partnership , whether between Member States and the EU or between regional , local and civil institutions .
<2en> Last but not least , Member States must guarantee the right to vote to all EU citizens residing in a Member State other than their original state at the time of legislative elections .
<sp>
<2en> The delegation of Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament has today voted in favour of Urszula Gacek 's ( PPE-DE , PL ) report on the problems and prospects of European citizenship .
<2en> We share the report 's overarching idea of improved European citizenship and improved freedom of movement .
<2en> However , we are of the opinion that the solution to the problems raised is to conduct further information campaigns .
<2en> We would also like to underscore the fact that the question of the right to vote in municipal elections is an internal matter for the Member States to decide upon .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) I should like to revisit the vote on my report , which was at second reading .
<en> All the groups in Parliament had a political agreement with the Council to adopt a number of amendments so that this regulation could become a proper regulation .
<en> Due to the absence of many MEPs - more than 400 are absent - we have been unable to adopt the package of amendments , which requires a qualified majority of 393 votes at second reading .
<en> We only managed 387 of the 395 votes cast .
<en> Due to the absence of many fellow MEPs , we have had to break our agreement with the Council .
<en> I should therefore like to ask the Bureau and Parliament 's administration to look into how we can salvage the situation at this point before Parliament goes into recess after 7 May , so that we can discuss and restore this situation during the next part-session .
<sp>
<en> I must say , Mr Staes , that we had already considered this issue , and that we are indeed going to look at this because it is a real issue and a real problem .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should like to ask the services to take into account that the Portuguese version is authentic for all amendments .
<2en> Secondly , I should like to ask that the order of voting be changed , and that Committee Amendment 43 be voted on before Amendment 83 for the sake of coherence .
<2en> Finally , I would point out that this directive that we are going to amend is 17 years old and is clearly out of date .
<2en> The revised directive will not enter into force before the end of the next legislative term .
<2en> In other words , we are legislating for the future , not for today .
<2en> In particular , we are legislating for the good of the citizens , thereby giving them more reasons to vote in the June elections .
<2en> I will therefore end by asking my fellow Members to support my report .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , as things stand at present , there are 89 amendments to this report .
<en> It is totally chaotic , and the vote that we are going to take will not allow us to hold a truly objective debate with the Council and the Commission .
<en> These 89 amendments are all totally at odds with each other .
<en> I propose we refer this report back to committee because , as Mrs Estrela said , we have plenty of time to do so .
<en> ( Loud applause )
<sp>
<en> Ms Lulling , could you kindly confirm to me whether or not you make that request on behalf of your political group ?
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Yes , Madam President , I never make anything not on behalf of my political group !
<en> ( Laughter and applause )
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Madam President , it does not make sense to refer this report , or this proposal , back to committee , because it was discussed with all the groups .
<en> It is presumably supported by a majority in this House .
<en> It was also discussed with the Commission and with the Council .
<en> Naturally , people have different opinions .
<en> We know that , regrettably , the Council under the Czech Presidency has adopted a very conservative attitude to the promotion of gender equality .
<en> I therefore call on the House to vote for the proposals and to support my report , because it will give the citizens more reasons to go out and vote in the European elections .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Protecting animals from cruelty is a very important responsibility .
<en> However , some of the proposals put forward in order to prevent cruelty , I believe , will actually cause more cruelty .
<en> I particularly refer to the proposal to have all slaughter at slaughter facilities .
<en> Famers would be forced to load and transport animals , even if they are sick or old , and such action would cause them pain and distress .
<en> This proposal also carries risks in terms of contagious disease and infection .
<en> Sometimes it is better to contain sickness by slaughtering an animal on its own farm , as long as this is done in a humane manner .
<en> I did not make my oral explanation .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote in favour of the report on the renewed social agenda .
<en> It is a good report , which , among other things , stipulates that economic freedoms and competition rules should never prevail over fundamental social rights .
<en> However , the report also contains requirements for minimum wage systems .
<en> We Social Democrats believe that it is important for everyone to be guaranteed a decent wage that it is possible to live on , and we think that the EU should encourage this .
<en> This is particularly important to enable us to deal with the problem of the ' working poor ' .
<en> How Member States then choose to guarantee their citizens a decent wage and whether they do this by means of legislation or by leaving it to the social partners to regulate via collective agreements must continue to be decided by the Member States themselves .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Conservatives support the principle of a minimum wage in the United Kingdom .
<en> However , we believe that social security schemes and the minimum wage should be determined at a national level .
<en> Therefore , Conservatives have abstained on this report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the Silva Peneda report on the Renewed Social Agenda .
<2en> In the framework of the current economic crisis , it is crucial that social policy goes hand in hand with economic policy , aiming at a recovery of the European economy .
<2en> The European social models are facing several challenges , namely demographic change and globalisation , to which they cannot stay immune .
<2en> Therefore , they need to be modernised with a long-term perspective , while also preserving their original values .
<2en> Europe must be ambitious with regard to social policy , all the more so now that we are facing a serious crisis .
<2en> However , I believe that the Commission 's Renewed Social Agenda is very unambitious , has come too late and is not really up to the challenges posed by the financial and economic crisis .
<2en> Social and employment policies must be strengthened to reduce or avoid job losses and to protect Europeans against social exclusion and the risk of poverty .
<sp>
<2en> This report contains many contradictions .
<2en> However , in essence , it insists on the existing guidelines of neoliberal capitalism , albeit mitigated here and there , but without altering the basic policies which are at the root of the current economic and social crisis .
<2en> The guiding principle is the same as always .
<2en> The ' crisis ' is now being used to once again ' sell ' the recipe of ' more of the same ' : flexibility , internal market , public-private partnerships , and so on , ignoring the fact that the EU 's policies are also at the root of the crisis and have made it worse .
<2en> The correct ' concerns ' included in the report do not tackle or respond to the main causes of the problems identified , particularly with regard to economic policies , job insecurity , liberalisation and privatisation of public services , and so on .
<2en> There are no alternative answers , particularly with regard to reinforcing the role of the State in the economy , in strategic sectors and in the expansion of high-quality public services , or even in the defence of higher wages and pensions .
<2en> However , the report does consider the need for a fairer distribution of wealth , but without indicating the ways to achieve this or calling for a break with those policies that have worsened social inequalities .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy .
<2en> The European Economic Recovery Plan provides investments amounting to EUR 5 billion for energy projects , broadband Internet and rural development measures .
<2en> EUR 3.98 billion will be invested in infrastructure for electricity , natural gas , wind power and for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide .
<2en> The European Parliament supports the allocation of EUR 1.02 billion for rural development projects .
<2en> The economic recovery plan is allocating EUR 200 million to the construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline which will transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea region to the EU .
<2en> Romania supports this project .
<2en> The key items of interest to Romania include funding in this recovery plan for gas interconnection projects between Romania and Hungary ( EUR 30 million ) and Romania and Bulgaria ( EUR 10 million ) , as well as for developing the equipment infrastructure enabling the gas flow to be reversed in the event of short-term disruption to the supply ( EUR 80 million ) .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the programme granting financial assistance to projects in the field of energy .
<2en> The European Parliament 's proposal for investment , based on an agreement reached with the Council , is built on three pillars , namely : interconnection of gas and electricity networks ; carbon capture and storage ; and offshore wind projects .
<2en> As such , the proposal sets out procedures and methods of providing financial assistance to stimulate investment in the creation of a European integrated energy network , whilst enhancing the European Union 's policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
<2en> There is a need for immediate action to stimulate the European economy and it is therefore vital to have measures ensuring an adequate geographical balance and speedy implementation .
<2en> In Portugal , gas network interconnection projects ( infrastructures and equipment ) are eligible , as too are projects to improve the electricity network interconnection with Spain .
<sp>
<2en> The Commission 's ambition to increase investments in energy infrastructure is the latest in a long line of examples of the arrogance that has infected the officials in Berlaymont .
<2en> The proposed investments are both extensive and costly , and it has yet to be demonstrated that all of these investments should be dealt with at EU level .
<2en> In total , investments amounting to EUR 3.5 billion are proposed for 2009 and 2010 - money that is to be provided from the Member States ' budgets .
<2en> As far as Sweden is concerned , this will mean a significant increase in the membership fees by an additional SEK 1.4 billion .
<2en> The fact that the Commission does not believe it has had time to carry out a thorough impact assessment of such a comprehensive proposal is utterly appalling .
<2en> The rapporteur for the European Parliament 's report does not seem to be particularly concerned by these objections .
<2en> Instead , an increase in assistance from EUR 3.5 billion to nearly EUR 4 billion is proposed !
<2en> Our mandate to work towards less costly EU cooperation leads us to reject this frivolous treatment of taxpayers ' money .
<2en> However , it should be pointed out that there are very good reasons for continuing to look for ways to improve and develop techniques for separating and storing carbon dioxide .
<2en> We have voted against the report as a whole .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) The proposal to set aside around EUR 4 billion for projects in the field of energy within the European energy programme for recovery is a good one .
<en> However , the content has become far too focussed on fossil fuels .
<en> In addition , there is a complete lack of support for projects for improving the efficiency of energy use .
<en> At an early stage , the Commission proposed that EUR 500 million be set aside for ' sustainable cities ' - a proposal that was , however , withdrawn .
<en> The assistance for ' sustainable cities ' would have enabled wide-ranging projects to develop district heating and combined heat and power as well as improvements in housing .
<en> Such projects would be cost-effective and would reduce emissions and create new jobs .
<en> It is deeply regrettable that the opportunity is not being taken , in connection with the economic crisis , to breathe new life into this type of measure .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The SPD Members of the European Parliament have rejected the report for two reasons :
<en> First , the retention for the securitisation of loans is an important and correct instrument for involving financial institutions in the business risk of the loans in question .
<en> However , this requires a significantly large retention .
<en> The 5 % retention agreed in the trialogue does not meet this requirement .
<en> The European Commission originally called for a 15 % retention in the consultation process but then bowed to pressure from industry and proposed 5 % .
<en> Conservatives and liberals in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wanted to declare even this low-level participation in the business risk unnecessary through the submission of a guarantee by the financial institutions .
<en> The SPD Members of the European Parliament support a much higher retention and will also emphasise this demand in future reforms of the Capital Requirements Directive .
<en> Second , the definition of core capital given in the Karas report violates the competitive neutrality of the regulation .
<en> It provides that , in future , silent capital contributions will no longer fully count as core capital , although they can be fully absorbed in the event of liquidity .
<en> This opens the floodgates to unfair competition against public banks in Germany .
<en> We note that silent capital contributions are a proven refinancing instrument , which is compatible with EU law .
<en> As the outcome of the trialogue does take account of the explanatory amendments we have proposed , we reject the report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I would like to say to all new Members of the European Parliament that the Minister is a former Member of this House , and so is one of us .
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - Mr President , on behalf of the Commission and on my own behalf , I want sincerely to congratulate you once again and wish you all the best in your term of office .
<en> Your election symbolises not only the reunification of Europe , but also a Europe that is very much attached to the central values of freedom and solidarity .
<en> Personally and institutionally I want to commit to close cooperation with you and with the European Parliament .
<en> Parliament and the Commission are the two Community institutions par excellence at the heart of Community matters .
<en> You and all the Members of this Parliament have been directly elected by our citizens and the Commission has the right and the duty to put European interests above any particular interest .
<en> I believe that we have a special responsibility for the European project in full respect of the Treaties .
<en> That is why I want to reiterate my willingness to work together to advance European parliamentary democracy .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr Buzek , I very much enjoyed your speech and especially the part about the institutional , but also social role played by Parliament , which you described as the very essence of the European democratic system .
<en> Today we are celebrating the Union of 27 which has come together once more , meeting here following the divisions caused by the ideologies of terror which built walls on our continent , walls which did not endure and which were blown down by the winds of democracy and freedom .
<en> This year we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the first elections to Parliament by direct universal suffrage , together with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall .
<en> I am pleased to recall , Mr Buzek , that when , for the first time , 30 years ago , my parents voted to elect the first MEPs from Italy , there was no right to vote in your country .
<en> In 1979 , just one year after Karol Wojtyla was elected Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church , while in Italy and in other countries the first European Parliament elections were being held , you were active in the then semi-clandestine trade union Solidarność , which fought to bring democracy and freedom to your country .
<en> To assert those same rights - democracy and freedom - we went to the polls , while every day you were risking your life and repression .
<en> For that reason , President Buzek , I am honoured to have contributed with my small and possibly non-decisive vote to your election , and I am pleased that today in Parliament , various histories are coming together and being ennobled , inspired by the same values and ideals : histories which make the great history of this young Europe strong .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I congratulate you on your election , and on a good speech .
<en> I would have liked you to devote a little more attention in your speech to the countries of Eastern Europe .
<en> In the near future , a very difficult election will be held in Ukraine .
<en> The European Parliament has a particular responsibility to show concern for democratic procedures in that country .
<en> It was in the European Parliament , in the foremost institution of the European Union , that support began for the great changes which took place five years ago .
<en> I would ask that this matter , connected with the presidential election in Ukraine , be treated in a special and unconventional way , with the involvement of those institutions and delegations which have been designated for this , so that the European Parliament will be known as a serious institution which is concerned about democratic procedures in Ukraine .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate you and I would like to say one thing to you in particular .
<en> A Parliament is measured by the way in which it uses and puts into practice its rights and by the fact that it does not withdraw from major political debate .
<en> We are all responsible for working together with you to ensure that this Parliament is not subjected to pressure from Commission proposals which are half-baked or which represent the unilateral interests of specific lobbyists .
<en> We are responsible for speaking up clearly at this point and we must do so .
<en> We must think about how the Treaty of Lisbon will change our situation .
<en> I hope that we will be able to do all of this .
<en> We must demonstrate clearly - and , in my opinion , this also concerns the question of the election of the Commission President - that we are making use of our rights and we must send a clear signal to the Commission .
<en> This means that there must now be no direct election of Mr Barroso .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I think the three institutions have made their viewpoint in this debate very clear .
<2en> Respect for human rights , tolerance , the inviolability of the individual and the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of - among other things - sexual orientation are fundamental values of the European project and must remain so .
<2en> The Member States have a duty to respect both these values and the actual laws that apply in these areas within the EU .
<2en> The Presidency is greatly concerned about the law in question , but we know that it is also subject to debate and criticism in Lithuania .
<2en> As has been mentioned , President Grybauskait- who was formerly a Commissioner and is well-informed concerning the values and laws of the EU - has herself initiated a process in which this law will be reviewed and made compatible with EU legislation .
<2en> I am extremely pleased that the Commission has been so clear about what will happen if , contrary to expectation , the law enters into force in its original form .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I fully agree with the Minister 's conclusions .
<2en> I would also just hope that the working group that Mrs Grybauskaithas put in place will be able to prevent the introduction of a law which , in some respects , would be at odds with European law .
<2en> I would like to stress one point : we feared that some of the provisions of the law would go against certain directives , on audiovisual services and on electronic commerce .
<2en> It is not actually our job to determine family law , which is one of the competences of the Member States .
<2en> This being so , everything that has been said previously and in the course of the debate shows that matters need to be assessed better at national level , in this case in Lithuania .
<sp>
<en> At the conclusion of this debate I have received five motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday 17 September 2009 .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 149 )
<sp>
<2en> My judgment on the motion for a resolution on the protection of minors in Lithuania is intended to demonstrate a very serious institutional concern .
<2en> Often , individual MEPs or political groups claim to address issues that relate to the domestic policy of individual States : that does not seem right .
<2en> In the case in point , the plan is seemingly to make the European Parliament express an essentially negative opinion on a Lithuanian law - the full content of which is unknown - with the laudable aim of protecting minors , while surreptitiously imposing a position that the individual Member States have been left to establish at their own discretion .
<2en> This , I might add , is something which the European Court of Human Rights has stipulated on many occasions .
<2en> The principle of equality is beyond doubt , and no one is trying to call into question the dignity of persons with particular sexual orientations .
<2en> My reservation is of an institutional nature because it concerns the relations between the European Union and individual Member States .
<sp>
<2en> Discrimination is prohibited under European and international law .
<2en> There are provisions to this effect in the treaties , the European Convention on Human Rights and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<2en> No Member State may enact laws that contradict these documents .
<2en> The Lithuanian law is inadmissible , as it is absurd and homophobic in nature .
<2en> Homophobia is a disease .
<2en> People who are afflicted by hatred for homosexuals deserve no sympathy .
<2en> They are not so much homophobes , as sexual orientation chauvinists .
<2en> And like all other chauvinists , they must be challenged and appropriate laws enacted against them .
<2en> In 1990 , the World Health Organisation removed homosexuality from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Problems .
<2en> It also confirmed that no type of sexual orientation is a disorder .
<2en> In any societies , including Lithuanian society , there are lesbians , gays and bisexual .
<2en> They make up about 4 to 7 % of the population .
<2en> They are a minority who are entitled to full rights .
<2en> The Equality Marches , which cause such concern to some people , are organised , amongst other reasons , to remind people of this basic , fundamental principle of equality .
<2en> For this reason , I appeal to the Council and the Presidency to take appropriate steps to prevent Member States from enacting discriminatory legislation .
<2en> We must show that the European Union says a firm NO to all discrimination and intolerance .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the joint debate on Elmar Brok 's report on the institutional aspects of setting up the European External Action Service - and the declaration of the Council and the Commission on the creation of a European External Action Service .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are approaching the time when the Treaty of Lisbon will finally be ratified and we are now beginning to consider how the treaty should be implemented .
<2en> We all know that the constitution must be turned into reality , which is just as important as the written words in a constitution or in a primary law , such as the treaty .
<2en> Therefore , I would like to remind everyone once again about the original intention , because our current discussions about the External Action Service , the High Representative and the Vice-President of the Commission represent one result of the Constitutional Convention , which was taken over by the intergovernmental conference for the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> The intention was to make the European Union more efficient by moving towards a situation where Europe speaks to the world with a single voice .
<2en> This is why we need this new type of High Representative and Vice-President , who must have a reliable service so that he or she can do justice to this task .
<2en> The second principle of the Constitutional Convention was transparency and the third was democracy .
<2en> These were the three starting points and it was clear to the parliamentary majority of the Constitutional Convention , which was made up in particular of national members of parliament , that the European Union is always better in areas where it acts according to the community method and is always relatively poor in areas where it acts according to the intergovernmental method .
<2en> In line with the spirit of these preparations , the implementation of the treaty must not lead to a strengthening of the intergovernmental approach with the result that the community method , which is democratically controllable , more successful and more transparent , is suppressed .
<2en> Therefore , I sometimes do not understand why the Member States are primarily interested in organigrams , but not in how these principles are put into practice .
<2en> We are of the opinion that we do not need a new bureaucracy located in the middle between the Council and the Commission which , in the long term , would consist of 6 000 to 8 000 people , would lead a life of its own and would become an independent kingdom outside our control .
<2en> Let us assume that this service will be assigned to the Commission as an administrative body and let us recognise that it must have a sui generis character .
<2en> It cannot be a normal office of the Commission , because in the area of foreign and security policy , the authority is divided between the Community and the Council .
<2en> Therefore , we must ensure that there is a safeguard in place for the Council so that its rights can be expressed in a reasonable way and so that a loyal approach is taken .
<2en> It is important to emphasise that the national experts in the Commission must be treated in a different way than was previously the case ; in other words , they must be given equal rights .
<2en> It must be made clear that Parliament 's scrutiny and budget rights must in no way be restricted , but instead should be strengthened .
<2en> Therefore , I would like to remind the Commission at this point in the debate that we not only have the right of consultation , but also that we parliamentarians have forced the Commission to give its consent .
<2en> We will not leave the Commission and the High Representative out of the hearings .
<2en> We must ensure that , in the case of changes relating to staff regulations and financial regulations , the European Parliament has the right of codecision in the same way as in the budget procedure .
<2en> Therefore , I would like to invite the two institutions to describe in their declarations the way in which the principles of efficiency , transparency and democracy can be combined with one another .
<2en> This is not clear to me from the earlier COREPER documents which I had access to .

<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Brok , honourable Members , the development of the European External Action Service is a matter that I know is of great interest to you here in Parliament .
<2en> I read with great interest and a strong sense of involvement the report tabled by Mr Brok and approved on Monday in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
<2en> Naturally , the Presidency is in complete agreement with what Mr Brok says in his report about the External Action Service in fact being key to our common work to make European foreign policy into an active and more cohesive instrument to enable European policy to be viewed in a better light around the world .
<2en> The intention is to bridge the gap that has existed between the Commission 's and the Council 's work so that the Union 's policies are moving in the same direction .
<2en> This is necessary in order for us to be able to be as effective as possible .
<2en> It is therefore important that we give the External Action Service as good a start as possible .
<2en> This is one of the greatest and most important challenges in the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> There are many pieces of the puzzle that need to fall into place and extensive preparations are therefore underway in the Council .
<2en> The objective is for the European Council to agree on a report that the High Representative , once he or she has been appointed , will be able to use as a starting point when he or she tables a proposal on the External Action Service .
<2en> During this work , the European Parliament will , of course , be consulted in connection with the tabling of the proposal by the High Representative .
<2en> Until this time , the Presidency will ensure that there is a regular dialogue with the European Parliament .
<2en> We have had this dialogue up to this point and will continue to do so .
<2en> It is important for the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to have regular contact on these issues , not only between officials , but also at policy level .
<2en> Immediately after the Irish referendum - and we are very pleased that the result was positive - the Member States and the Commission began very intensive work to prepare the European External Action Service .
<2en> This work is progressing and I am absolutely certain that we will be able to present a number of usable ideas to the European Council next week with regard to the future High Representative .
<2en> Since it is the High Representative 's job to table the final proposal , he or she will , of course , be involved in the work as soon as he or she has been appointed .
<2en> This is very important in order to enable him or her to have some input into the proposal .
<2en> The Presidency will present an agreement on principles covering five major elements , namely , the scope of the External Action Service 's activities , its legal position , its staffing and financing and the EU delegations .
<2en> We have not completed this yet and discussions are still ongoing , but I will give you an idea of how far we have progressed hitherto , and in this regard , there appears to be a high level of agreement between the Council and the Commission , and I hope eventually with the European Parliament , too .
<2en> With regard to the scope of the European External Action Service 's activities , it is clear that we should establish geographical and thematic ' desk functions ' with collective responsibility for tasks that are currently handled by the Commission and the Council Secretariat .
<2en> The Commission will continue to have the main responsibility for matters relating to trade , aid and enlargement , even though it still remains to be established exactly where the dividing line between the Commission and the External Action Service is to go with regard to aid .
<2en> The Member States and the Commission also agree that the legal status of the External Action Service should reflect and support the unique role , sui generis , that it has within the EU system .
<2en> Whatever legal solution is finally decided upon , it must fulfil the principles of good administration and the prospect of accountability .
<2en> Staff will be recruited from the Commission , the Council Secretariat and the Member States .
<2en> This is clearly laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> All of these categories of personnel are to be entitled to take office on equal terms .
<2en> The EU delegations will be placed under the authority of the High Representative as soon as the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force .
<2en> One important matter in the setting up of the European External Action Service is contact with the European Parliament .
<2en> Once the High Representative has been appointed , he or she will regularly consult the European Parliament on the principal paths and the important choices of direction within the common foreign and security policy as well as the common security and defence policy .
<2en> I am sure that close contact with the European Parliament will also be fostered at the level of the officials .
<2en> The European External Action Service should therefore have a facility that is responsible for contact with Parliament .
<2en> This is roughly as far as we have got in the discussions .
<2en> I cannot go into more detail , as we have not finished our talks yet , but we will do everything we can to continue to keep Parliament informed of the progress made .
<2en> Of course , the High Representative has not yet been appointed , so these ideas are still just ideas , that is all .
<2en> Ultimately , it will be the High Representative who tables the proposal in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty .
<2en> With that , I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak and I look forward to a constructive debate , during which I will , of course , listen very closely to Parliament 's views and answer any questions you may have to the best of my ability .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , we are , I hope , on the very last lap of the process of bringing the Treaty of Lisbon into force , completing a process which has taken eight years of discussions and negotiations .
<en> After the decisive result of the Irish referendum , we all hope that the Czech ratification can finally follow very soon .
<en> If we achieve this on the 20th anniversary of the reunification of Europe , it will be a great day for Europe and its citizens - not least because we will be able to focus all our attention on the pressing challenges and policy concerns that lie ahead of us .
<en> As we reach the final stages , allow me to congratulate Parliament , and particularly the Constitutional Affairs Committee , with Elmar Brok as rapporteur , on delivering its opinion on the key element of the Lisbon Treaty which is the External European Action Service .
<en> The creation of the EEAS offers the European Union and all its component institutions the chance to achieve what we have long hoped for : to have a common voice in the world and to strengthen the EU 's influence in the world .
<en> Mr Brok 's report recognises this great potential .
<en> Together with this important debate and many other consultations with Parliament representatives , it provides vital input to our work with the Swedish Presidency , but also with the Member States and the Council Secretariat , over the coming months .
<en> I am happy to confirm that the Commission strongly supports Parliament 's overall approach .
<en> I agree with the principles of transparency , democracy and coherence that you have just mentioned .
<en> It is obviously important that all the institutions work together to help the newly-appointed High Representative Vice-President in his or her task of preparing the decision on the creation of an EEAS - a decision which , as you know , requires the consent of the Commission and the consultation of Parliament .
<en> Firstly , let me mention the status of the EEAS .
<en> Indeed it will be sui generis as there is no model to follow .
<en> We are building something new .
<en> It will neither be intergovernmental nor purely based on the Community method , but we must ensure that the new system has a genuinely European approach inspired by and grounded in the strengths of Community policies , as again was mentioned .
<en> The key question for us all is what the EEAS should be able to deliver .
<en> This should be our objective .
<en> By bringing together the various actors in the field of external relations , we can ensure that our relations with the outside world are clear , coherent and driven by a single set of policy goals .
<en> It must carry authority as the core of EU external policy , the place where policy is developed and coordinated .
<en> It must also be seen to be such , both from inside and from outside the European Union , and the EEAS will only be effective if it works well with other institutions and fully respects the interinstitutional balance .
<en> This is why I think it is very important that the EEAS should be set up in a way which allows it to work very closely with the Commission and the Council and to respect the need to be fully accountable to the European Parliament .
<en> For the Parliament , the bringing together of external action responsibilities into a single service will , I believe , mean a step change in Parliament 's capacity to fulfil its role of scrutinising Union policy .
<en> Like the service itself , the way in which Parliament relates to the service and to the High Representative Vice-President will also , in a way , have to be sui generis .
<en> The creation of the EEAS will require a variety of decisions , probably including changes to the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations , both of which require a Commission proposal and adoption through codecision .
<en> The High Representative Vice-President needs the authority to manage the service , but the service also needs to serve the EU system as a whole - most obviously , the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council , as well as the other Commissioners with a role in external relations .
<en> It must be able to offer its assistance , both in Brussels and in third countries , to the European Parliament and to its official delegations which travel abroad .
<en> The close involvement of the Member States in the new service is one of its key innovations .
<en> The COREPER ambassadors are looking at how best to ensure that high-quality Member States ' diplomats can be brought into the service early .
<en> We in the Commission are examining how this may be done pending the modification of the Staff Regulations , and appointment to the service should be through selection procedures based on merit , with appropriate account being taken of the need for a geographic and gender balance .
<en> This very much meets the wishes expressed in the report .
<en> We also believe that all members of the EEAS , whether officials of the EU institutions or Member States ' officials on temporary contracts , should enjoy the same rights .
<en> They will be equal in every sense .
<en> As for the scope of the service , it needs to have a comprehensive overview of the Union 's relations with the rest of the world , so it needs geographical desks as well as horizontal services to cover questions such as CFSP and CSDP , human rights and relations with UN bodies .
<en> The aim is to prevent duplication and to ensure that all those responsible for delivering EU external policy work effectively together , and the Commission will also continue to have services responsible for trade , development policy , aid implementation , humanitarian aid and enlargement .
<en> It will also , of course , continue to drive the external aspects of the Union 's key internal policies , and a central question in the current debate is how to manage the programming of external assistance .
<en> I can assure Parliament that the EU 's development policy , including poverty eradication , will be a central part of the Commission 's external activities .
<en> The High Representative Vice-President and the Commissioner for Development will work extremely closely together on this .
<en> The fact that the new High Representative will also be a Vice-President of the Commission , responsible for coordinating all of the EU 's external action , will help .
<en> The service will also be responsible for the administration of delegations , though the people inside delegations will come , as now , from different services - not just the EEAS , but also the Commission services and maybe other institutions and bodies of the European Union .
<en> From the entry into force of the Treaty , Commission delegations will become EU delegations .
<en> This will give them new responsibilities , but it will not diminish their role in representing the full range of Commission activities .
<en> The EU delegations should be responsible for representation , coordination and negotiation as from the day the Treaty comes into force .
<en> In most places , this procedure will go quite smoothly .
<en> However , in some , where the workload is particularly heavy , it will be necessary to organise a form of burden-sharing , not only with the rotating Presidency but also with other Member States .
<en> The creation of an entirely new external service is a major undertaking .
<en> It will , as your report says , evolve over time .
<en> We will learn together .
<en> Our first aim must be that during the period between the entry into force of the Treaty and the coming into being of the EEAS , the effective delivery of the EU 's external policies is maintained .
<en> We and the Council Secretariat will work together with the High Representative Vice-President to ensure that there is no gap .
<en> But we need to look further .
<en> We will be bringing together officials and diplomats from the different institutions and all the Member States .
<en> As we know , a common foreign policy is not just the sum of 27 national policies .
<en> We need people within the EEAS who , while not losing their distinctive national ties , think European .
<en> We therefore need to create an EU diplomatic culture and an EU esprit de corps .
<en> For this , training is essential .
<en> The report raises the promising idea of the creation of a European diplomatic academy .
<en> In the meantime , we can make good use of the Member States ' diplomatic academies .
<en> I very recently attended the 10th anniversary of the European diplomatic programme , which has anticipated and shown the way .
<en> It is worth remarking that since the 1970s , the Commission has already organised training seminars for more than 5 700 diplomats .
<en> One of the tasks of the EEAS will be to establish a training strategy to ensure that all members , whatever their background , will be equipped to carry out their tasks .
<en> Heads of delegations , in particular , will have to be able not only to carry out their political role , but also to handle all the Commission activities that are such a substantial part of a delegation 's mandate .
<en> Mr Brok 's report also raises the question of whether consular services might be covered by the EEAS .
<en> The Commission is open to this idea even if it may take some time to develop .
<en> These are matters for the future .
<en> For the present , it is a challenge for us to ensure that the EEAS functions well and in the interests of all : the European citizens , the Member States and the European Union .
<en> The Commission supports the creation of the EEAS , wants it to succeed , and will contribute in every way possible to ensure that it does so .
<en> This report shows that Parliament will do the same .
<en> I am sorry to have been a little long , but I think this is such an important matter .
<en> Please forgive me , Mr President .
<sp>
<en> Commissioner , of course I forgive you , because I fully agree with you .
<en> It is a very important topic .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Against the current backdrop of economic , financial and social crisis , it was essential for the budget of the European Union for 2010 to place a special emphasis on this situation and for it to become an effective tool to overcome the crisis .
<2en> I therefore voted in favour of the draft EU budget for 2010 , as I believe that it comprehensively responds to these needs .
<2en> Parliament is determined to do all it can to guarantee adequate financing for all activities and policies which encourage growth and job creation , and which provide solutions for European citizens .
<2en> More specifically , this means improved energy security , increased support for research and innovation , particularly in the area of clean technologies , promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and increased support for lifelong learning .
<2en> In this regard , as proposed by the Portuguese Social Democrat MEPs , I wish to highlight the importance of creating an Erasmus employment programme , aimed at young people seeking first-time employment , to help achieve these goals .
<2en> Lastly , I must stress that I do not agree with the Council 's additional reductions in the budget headings in support of the Lisbon Strategy , given that such cuts go against what should be done to encourage growth and economic recovery .
<sp>
<2en> Whilst cohesion policy plays an essential role in efforts to combat the economic crisis and climate change , the Council had proposed substantially reducing the payment appropriations allocated to it in 2010 .
<2en> Aware as we are of the importance of European funds and of the expectation that exists on the ground , it was essential for we MEPs to re-establish , or even in some cases increase , the amounts suggested in advance by the European Commission .
<2en> This vote is the expression of the political Europe that we need , one that is capable of taking budgetary decisions that ensure a good future for solidarity , competitiveness and growth , for the benefit of its citizens .
<2en> The MEPs have today confirmed their support for a European cohesion policy that really does have the resources to meet its ambitions .
<2en> Approving also of the general direction of the reports by Mr Surján and Mr Maňka on the European Union 's draft budget for the 2010 financial year , it is therefore with determination that I have voted in favour of their adoption .
<sp>
<2en> I support the Surján report as a possible compromise with regard to the EU budget .
<2en> I regret that the Council has reduced yet further the Commission 's preliminary draft budget , which , in my opinion , already fell short of what is needed .
<2en> We cannot have more Europe with a meagre budget that is clearly inadequate .
<2en> I particularly disagree with the cuts made in the budget headings in support of the Lisbon Strategy .
<2en> The discrepancy between the public declarations to prioritise tackling the economic crisis and supporting ' competitiveness for growth and employment ' , and the appropriations provided for in this draft budget , could not be greater .
<2en> I welcome the increased appropriations in the area of freedom , security and justice and I would stress that building a Europe of citizens also depends on proper implementation of these budget headings .
<sp>
<2en> I did not vote in favour of creating a EUR 300 million fund and for immediate support targeted at milk producers as I believe that the producers of dairy products are facing a collapse in prices , which is causing insecurity .
<2en> In fact , the position adopted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament ( S & D ) for a EUR 600 million fund would have been a quicker and more effective means of combating the causes and , above all , the effects which have led to a significant decline in the dairy product market , which is continuing in the context of the current economic crisis .
<2en> I also believe that the set of support measures adopted by the European Commission has come too late .
<2en> Indeed , the EUR 600 million fund would have provided real support for the Member States facing this crisis .
<sp>
<2en> The group of amendments to the EU 's budget for 2010 which make up ' Block 3 ' contains interventions and support measures that we oppose as a matter of principle ( in the same way as we are critical of - and vote against - EU support for tobacco growing ) .
<2en> This includes various storage measures , for example , for alcohol , and extensive EU support for the wine sector .
<2en> It also includes EU support for milk and fruit in schools , which in itself is important , but we believe this matter should instead be dealt with at national level .
<2en> At the same time , the Block 3 group of amendments contains important investments in animal welfare and the control of animal transport , for example , which we would , in principle , welcome , as we strongly support these issues in other contexts , but since the voting procedure forces us to take a view of the group of amendments as a whole , we have chosen to abstain from voting on Block 3 .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the creation of this microfinance facility for employment , since it aims at providing opportunities for the unemployed and encouraging entrepreneurship .
<2en> This facility , which is aimed at people who want to start or develop a micro-enterprise ( less than 10 employees and a turnover of less than EUR 2 million ) , will open up new horizons for many unemployed people .
<2en> Given the current state of the economy , it would have been useful if this important programme had been launched sooner , because people have been finding it difficult to access credit for a long time now .
<2en> As this facility is aimed at public and private organisations that provide private individuals and micro-enterprises with micro-credit at national , regional and local levels in EU Member States , it needs to be carefully monitored by the relevant bodies to ensure that the credit is actually reaching the places where it is most needed and that we do not see a repeat of the situations that occurred during the last financial crisis .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am in favour of the state providing microfinance to individuals to help them to establish small businesses .
<en> However , I am opposed to the European Union carrying out this function .
<en> Nevertheless , I did vote in favour of some amendments because it was always likely that the resolution would be carried and I wished to improve the resolution as much as possible .
<en> The ' blocking ' of the votes on several amendments prevented me from voting separately on some amendments .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - One of the most detrimental consequences of the global economic crisis is the lack of credit being supplied by banks , which is preventing individuals as well as large companies from conducting their economic activities .
<en> The proposal being made by the European Commission provides for the establishment of a microfinance facility that seeks to aid in alleviating the current hesitation in funding by banks and other financial institutions .
<en> It is for this reason that I have decided to support the rapporteur on this issue and vote in favour of the report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the report because unemployment , which is constantly increasing in the European Union , cannot be combated with a microfinance programme .
<2en> Integrated programmes with adequate funding under a separate budget line are needed , programmes which focus on combating youth unemployment , which is extremely high in Greece in particular , with one in four young people under the age of 25 out of work .
<2en> Generally speaking , what we need are policies which call for an increase in the Community budget and which overturn the neoliberal framework of the Stability Pact and low deficits .
<2en> I also believe that funding within the framework of this mechanism should be purely voluntary and should not in any way force anyone to use the mechanism under the threat that their social security benefits will be cut or reduced .
<2en> Unfortunately , amendments to this effect tabled by me and my fellow members in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected .
<sp>
<2en> As Europe is going through a deep economic and financial crisis , which has led to serious social problems with unemployment growing in all the Member States , it is essential for the European Union to create effective mechanisms for tackling the crisis and also supporting those worst affected , including the unemployed and businesses in difficulty .
<2en> That is why I welcome the creation of a microfinance facility for employment , focusing on entrepreneurship and giving everyone the opportunity to start their own business .
<2en> European microfinance will be available for cases where access to banking credit is denied or made difficult , through support for the growth of micro-enterprises , together with mentoring , coaching and interest-rate support from the European Social Fund .
<2en> It is also important to point out that this facility should serve the sole purpose of supporting entrepreneurship as a means of creating new jobs , by helping to realise solid business ideas , and it should not be used for social support or to boost consumption .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , honourable Members , I stand in Parliament today in order to share with you my views on the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit and the challenges that arise from it , both for the European Union and for the rotating Presidency that Spain holds for the first half of 2010 .
<2en> The European Union Environment Ministers discussed these matters at length last weekend .
<2en> I should point out that we broadly agree on our desire to continue moving forward , on three issues in particular : building on the results of the summit , with a view to making them operational as soon as possible ; strengthening their elements within the United Nations ; and working to fulfil our goals to reduce overall emissions .
<2en> We have shared goals and strategies .
<2en> As a result , our most immediate tasks will be to complete the process of formally announcing our commitment ; to consolidate an action framework comparable to that of other industrialised and emerging nations ; and to make use of all the tools we have available , both within the European Union and in our relationships with third countries .
<2en> The December summit - an extremely complicated conference characterised by arduous discussions on procedure - was brought to a conclusion in the so-called Copenhagen Accord .
<2en> A large number of Heads of State or Government and leaders of regional groups were personally involved in producing the document that was adopted , which represents the will of countries whose emissions total more than 80 % of those produced globally .
<2en> Participants included all the industrialised countries , major emerging economies , and a significant number of especially vulnerable countries .
<2en> This should also help us to respond to the many doubts that continue to clog up the formal process which should lead us towards legally binding solutions , within the United Nations framework and preferably in Mexico .
<2en> With regard to the content of the Accord , I think it is important to stress that we have clear support for not allowing the temperature to rise by more than two degrees centigrade .
<2en> This is surely one of its strongest elements with the greatest potential for results : the commitment of all industrialised countries to establish a target for reduction that can be applied right across their economies .
<2en> Emerging nations , for their part , will take concrete , verifiable action that will allow them to make a substantial reduction in their emissions growth : financing based on solidarity and aimed at supporting immediate and medium-term action in the fight against climate change ; elements intended to steer new models of governance ; and mechanisms that foster technological development and a reduction in emissions caused by deforestation .
<2en> The Copenhagen Summit has shown that we are moving within a new international context , one that requires improvements if we want to provide solutions to global problems .
<2en> The decision-making rules in place need to be changed so that they can adapt properly to these new times and necessities .
<2en> We do have the tools we need in order to act : a legislative package already in place at Community level ; the very highest commitment to furthering a reduction in emissions , international solidarity and technological innovation and cooperation ; and the correct institutional structure within the Union , which we must use intelligently , taking full advantage of its complementarity .
<2en> We will have to combine the leadership of the Environment Council when negotiating and planning climate change policies with greater capacity for external action .
<2en> Furthermore , we should link the environmental task ahead with our experts ' opinions on policies relating to the economy and innovation ; we should also improve consistency between our climate goals and our model of development and well-being .
<2en> All of this must be done without losing sight of the need - both inside and outside the European Union - to consolidate the role of public opinion and of legislators who are committed to investing in a better future and to protecting public interests .
<2en> Let us bring to bear our collective European experience .
<2en> Firstly , we have to push for a proper response before 31 January .
<2en> The Copenhagen Accord , by bringing together all those who have to reduce their emissions , thus enables a comparison of efforts to be made , a comparison that the European Union has demanded ; yet we are still not sure how strong other countries ' commitments really are .
<2en> If they prove to be insufficient , we must continue working to further our collective reductions .
<2en> We will also have to bring about conditions which allow those elements that make up the accord to be applied swiftly .
<2en> It is vital for the European Union and its Member States to be at the forefront of those countries that keep their promises .
<2en> For this reason , we will need to carry out the transfer of funds as soon as possible , planned for the period 2010-2012 .
<2en> We want to develop a financial framework that can sustain our solidarity commitments with third countries in the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund and , at the same time , foster improvements in accounting rules and our response in terms of both reductions in emissions caused by deforestation and technological cooperation .
<2en> The following elements need to be added to this : our own policies , aimed at fulfilling our emissions reduction targets at both national and Community level ; the boost provided by innovation and intelligent energy use ; the incorporation of adaptation measures for sectoral policies ; and consistent external action .
<2en> We want to work closely with the Commission and Parliament on all of this , seeking to establish the world region that stands at the forefront of the fight against climate change , that has the lowest carbon emissions , that is the best prepared to face the challenges presented by climate change and is the most efficient at transforming this into a powerful force for innovation and competitiveness .
<2en> Our policy on climate change is one of the key identifying characteristics of the European model .
<2en> We have been pioneers when integrating that principle into our proposals for a fairer and more sustainable development , not only economic , but also social and environmental , knowing that we are strengthening international security in the process .
<2en> This fact has enabled major players , such as China and the United States , to come together at the same negotiating table and to identify and share decisive elements for cooperation .
<2en> The European Union , a staunch defender of the United Nations ' role in resolving global issues , will also have work to do in other areas , both bilateral and multilateral , formal and informal , helping everyone to correctly identify opportunities , listening to our partners , and working on consolidating sectoral responses that are consistent with what is needed to fight climate change .
<2en> We must take full advantage of the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon and the entry into force of the new institutions , systematically incorporating the main messages on the fight against climate change into our relations with third countries .
<2en> This is no small task we are facing .
<2en> The government of Spain is aware of the magnitude of the challenge and wishes to show here that it is committed to making as much progress as possible on those elements that may facilitate an ambitious , binding agreement in Mexico .
<2en> We cannot waste the political opportunity that was created in Copenhagen , nor lower our expectations or those of the international community .
<2en> Our credibility is at stake .
<2en> We have to stand our ground .
<2en> The new , greater powers of the European Parliament , which bring it even closer to the citizens , will enable closer , more fruitful cooperation .
<2en> I want to conclude my speech by congratulating everyone on that point and reminding you all that , now more than ever , we need your hard work and support over the vital six-month period that lies ahead .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me thank you on behalf of the Commission for the chance to discuss the outcome of the Copenhagen conference on climate change and the follow-up to the Copenhagen Accord .
<en> My colleague , Stavros Dimas , has asked me to apologise on his behalf for not being able to be here himself because he is ill , which is particularly regrettable as this would probably have been his last plenary appearance .
<en> I volunteered to substitute for Stavros in this very important debate .
<en> I want to express our appreciation for the active and supportive role the European Parliament played before the conference and at the conference itself .
<en> The contacts with your delegation throughout the conference proved most useful .
<en> In particular , you have played a crucial role in order to enhance our outreach with key players in other countries and other regions .
<en> I believe we share the view that the result of Copenhagen falls badly short of our goal of an ambitious and legally binding agreement , which would be necessary to limit climate change to below 2 ° C. This is extremely disappointing for all of us who have fought for years and years for concrete policy decisions to reverse climate change .
<en> The reasons for the failure were many and I will come back to them in a moment .
<en> Still , one may also conclude that the Accord is better than no outcome at all , which would have been the worst-case scenario .
<en> On the one hand - to find something positive - the Copenhagen Accord at least recognises the need to limit climate change to below 2 ° C. It also invites the developed countries to list economy-wide emission targets by 31 January 2010 and calls for the developing countries to list mitigation actions by the same date .
<en> Furthermore , the Accord sets the basis for a rather substantial financial package of USD 30 billion for the coming three years and recognises the need for USD 100 billion annually by 2020 .
<en> On the other hand , the Accord has serious weaknesses .
<en> It contains no reference to mid-term or long-term mitigation targets .
<en> The reduction pledges announced so far are not sufficient to stay within the target of 2 ° C. There is unfortunately , in my view , little cause for optimism that we will see improved offers by 31 January - rather the opposite .
<en> Last , but certainly not least , the Accord is not legally binding and , perhaps even more worrying , it does not provide for the conclusion of a legally binding agreement this year , which was one of our key goals .
<en> Looking ahead , the next step will be to ensure that this Accord will at least become operational and will pave the way for a new climate treaty , which must be agreed on urgently in the course of this year .
<en> As a very first step , it will be crucial to ensure that all key parties now endorse the Accord and notify their targets or actions by 31 January .
<en> Adequate financing also needs to be provided .
<en> In this respect , we need to explore ways of setting up a Copenhagen Green Climate Fund .
<en> We must also strengthen alliances with countries and regions who share our vision of a successful outcome in the international climate negotiations .
<en> To conclude , we have huge challenges before us to ensure unity at the European level , to engage strategically with key external partners and to maintain our full commitment to multilateral climate action , but there are many lessons to be learned from COP 15 .
<en> One striking lesson certainly is that we must learn to speak with one voice .
<en> In Copenhagen , China , India , the United States and other major powers each spoke with one voice , while Europe spoke with many different voices .
<en> The same goes for global economic governance and international security .
<en> We are indeed at a crossroads today .
<en> Either we take determined and united action for Europe 's ecological , economic and political revival , or we risk economic stagnation and political irrelevance .
<en> Let us take Copenhagen as an alarming warning of that scenario .
<en> We must do better than that and we can do .
<en> Only by standing united can we succeed , and I look forward to working with you to achieve this objective .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , first of all , may I ask you to give our regards to Commissioner Dimas and convey the thanks of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) for his efforts over recent years .
<2en> Naturally , we , too , are disappointed by the results of the climate-change summit , but it is important not to forget that historic steps have indeed been taken with regard to certain elements , for example climate financing , deforestation and the two-degree target ; even though this is imperfect , as you rightly pointed out .
<2en> Naturally , we would have preferred something much more ambitious - see our resolution - but these are initial steps on which we must now build .
<2en> It is extremely important that we carry out an in-depth analysis of Europe 's contribution to this summit , as Europe was absent at the crucial time .
<2en> The summit may have been well prepared by Europe from a content and technical point of view , but politically speaking it was a disaster .
<2en> Europe 's political performance was simply poor .
<2en> You are right in saying that Europe must speak with one voice , but that is easier said than done .
<2en> We really must now make use of the opportunities offered by the new Treaty of Lisbon , too .
<2en> Two new women will - we hope - soon be in the front line : Mrs Hedegaard and Mrs Ashton .
<2en> They must bring in the rest of the world , paving the road to Mexico with strong climate diplomacy .
<2en> Mr President , the PPE Group sees it as a given that we must retain the 30 % target expressed in our November resolution , and must combine this target with not only European but also global ambition .
<2en> We must revise our strategy , as it was not endorsed ; a number of the key players did not endorse a global target .
<2en> We must revise our strategy , but we must also retain our ambition .
<sp>
<2en> The Copenhagen Summit was a failure .
<2en> The gap between the world 's richer and poorer countries has increased , and neither the Swedish Presidency nor the Danish Prime Minister was able to prevent or avoid that .
<2en> As a fellow Member said recently , Europe was absent .
<2en> After this disappointment , it is important to regain the initiative .
<2en> Naturally , this cannot be achieved by refusing to acknowledge that the Copenhagen conference was a failure - as Mrs Hedegaard , the candidate Commissioner for Climate Action , has done .
<2en> That only increases the risk of the mistakes being repeated .
<2en> How will the Spanish Presidency and the Commission pave the way for a binding climate agreement in Mexico ?
<2en> Will you secure financing for the new climate initiatives in developing countries so that it is not just a repackaging of aid funding that is already intended for fighting poverty , among other things ?
<2en> Will you propose that our own emissions reductions are stepped up from 20 to 30 per cent ?
<2en> That would be regaining the initiative .
<2en> Will you eradicate the developing countries ' distrust by noting the value of the Kyoto agreement as a basis for continued work on a global climate agreement ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the S & D Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , following the disappointing conclusion to the climate conference in Copenhagen , Parliament is using this resolution to make it clear that there is no alternative to climate protection and that , as we move towards the next conference in Mexico , we must increase rather than decrease our efforts in this area .
<en> I shall be brief .
<en> Amendment 6 from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was intended to serve this purpose .
<en> However , as it has been worded confusingly , we are withdrawing it .
<en> Nevertheless , we do support Amendments 1 and 9 from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , which call on the EU to do more en route to Mexico .
<en> Climate protection must not come to a standstill .
<en> I would ask for your support .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to Amendment 21 , which I have tabled , I should first like to thank all my fellow Members for having supported me in tabling an amendment which lays down the principle of establishing a carbon tax at the borders of the EU .
<en> I should also like to say once again that we must not use double-speak when talking to our fellow citizens : when we are campaigning , we cannot say that Europe is protecting them , that it will protect their companies and their jobs and then , once we have been elected , forget about that commitment .
<en> I should merely like to point out that this amendment has enabled me to stimulate debate , which is why I wish to withdraw it and thus allow debate to thrive in the Council .
<sp>
<en> The amendment is therefore withdrawn .
<en> Before the vote on Amendment 10 :
<sp>
<en> Mr President , Amendment 10 by the Greens is not in conflict with Amendment 1 .
<en> Amendment 1 is about raising our ambition level to more than 20 .
<en> Amendment 10 - our amendment - is about clarifying conditions to minus 40 .
<en> This is additional to , not in conflict with , Amendment 1 , so Amendment 10 should be voted .
<sp>
<en> The officials do not agree with your view , but I would like to ask the chair of the relevant committee for an opinion .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the S & D Group . - ( DE ) I am on Mrs Hassi 's side .
<en> This is a new idea and we should vote on it .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I fully support the driving spirit behind the resolution which has the merit of being based on the assumption that the debate on demographic changes is connected with the debate on measures necessary to combat the impact of the economic and financial crisis on the labour market .
<2en> Considering that our analysis of progress in achieving the Lisbon objectives is not encouraging , we welcome the call expressed in the resolution to speed up legislative changes in Member States , to tighten up infringement procedures and encourage greater participation of women in key sectors of the labour market that reflects the goals they have achieved as far as training is concerned .
<2en> Having said this , I am bound to voice my absolute disapproval , already expressed at the voting stage , of this pernicious will to promote an abortion society by providing incentives for free access to termination of pregnancy .
<2en> The assumption that women must be able to achieve easier abortions in order to recover their right to sexual freedom not only runs counter to general lay morals , but also contradicts the principles enshrined in recital Z , which states that the promotion of ' higher birth rates to meet future requirements ' is central to the European action .
<2en> I remain firm in my commitment to promoting a responsible sexual culture .
<sp>
<2en> Women are the main victims of the economic and social crisis that the European Union 's neoliberal policies have created .
<2en> Thanks to the crisis , the number of insecure jobs and compulsory part-time positions are increasing .
<2en> The patriarchy still completely pervades our societies .
<2en> They are now scarred by the forceful return of stigmatisation on religious grounds , and women are forever the main victims of these changes .
<2en> It is therefore gratifying to see the European Parliament place such a crucial matter as equality between women and men on the agenda .
<2en> It is a shame , however , that the text does not focus on the intrinsically unequal nature of neoliberalism .
<2en> It is neoliberalism that is responsible for many of the problems suffered by women and , in the deepening of the inequalities between the sexes , it finds yet another way to flourish .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Inequalities between men and women on various levels , whether by profession , sector or different stereotypes , have become blurred over the years .
<en> Equality between men and women in the EU is increasingly a reality , and although there are still cases of discrimination , we are beginning to see very positive developments .
<sp>
<2en> Although there have been many improvements in the area of equal opportunities for women , there is still much to be done .
<2en> One of the most urgent issues is to provide greater support for reconciling professional and family life , which , for many women and , in particular , single mothers , is an insurmountable obstacle .
<2en> The fact that men are still more likely to be entrusted with positions of responsibility proves that equality at work can only be achieved by a change in attitudes and not by imposing quotas , particularly because quotas are controversial and can easily lead to conflict .
<2en> As this report fails to deal with the criticism that gender mainstreaming can also swing in the other direction , I have voted against it .
<sp>
<2en> The resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union seems completely balanced to me , and I welcome the work carried out by Mr Tarabella to achieve this outcome .
<2en> Flagrant inequalities between men and women still exist today in the employment sector , particularly when it comes to differences in pay or even reconciling work and family life .
<2en> There are still efforts to be made in this area .
<2en> Moreover , with regard to the protection of sexual and reproductive rights , it is essential that women have access to contraception and abortion .
<2en> Women must be able to have full physical autonomy .
<2en> That is why I voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights .
<2en> Finally , I voted against the proposal to create a European charter of women 's rights because , since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which includes women 's rights , forms an integral part of the treaties .
<2en> This charter is legally binding and enables women to be protected in the same way as men .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , terrorism is a global threat and tackling it is a responsibility that we all share .
<en> In this regard , too , the Lisbon Treaty lays the foundations for us to be able to finally develop a common anti-terrorism policy in the European Union .
<en> I agree entirely with the comments of the President-in-Office of the Council and would like to highlight some of the elements on which such a common policy must be built .
<en> The first is to step up the exchange of information , particularly in relation to the efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and research into funding mechanisms .
<en> The second is to apply all of the scientific and technological advances that have been achieved to the fight against terrorism , with due respect for individuals ' fundamental rights .
<en> The third is to work with third countries , especially Afghanistan , Pakistan and the countries of the Horn of Africa .
<en> Fourthly , in the debate on air safety we must ensure that technological advances , namely body scanners , are compatible with human health and privacy and , above all , that they do not affect processing times in airports or passenger comfort .
<en> However , there are also three institutional elements .
<en> The first is COSI , the Standing Committee on Internal Security .
<en> The second is the declaration on counter-terrorism measures issued at the last informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs ( JHA ) Council of the European Union in Toledo .
<en> The third is the transatlantic area of security , which must provide for the development of close cooperation with the United States to combat this common threat .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , one of the means of preventing terrorism is information .
<en> Even then , information needs to circulate .
<en> Is this really the case today ?
<en> Nothing is less certain .
<en> Do the US intelligence services keep their European counterparts up to date ?
<en> In any event , as far as the alleged terrorist arrested on the Amsterdam-Detroit flight is concerned , there is still cause for doubt .
<en> Apart from this incident , there is the issue of knowing whether , generally speaking , the system for exchanging counterterrorism data really does observe the principle of reciprocity .
<en> A parliamentary supervisory body on the matter is urgently required .
<en> In fact , there is no need to call on our Parliament to support the transfer of more and more of our citizens ' personal data if , by contrast , the US authorities deprive our services of essential counterterrorism data .
<en> This entails the creation of a parliamentary supervisory committee within the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must admit that when we talk about the fight against terrorism only in terms of intelligence and technology , I always feel as though we are still not getting to the bottom of things , as though we wanted to cure a disease by only concentrating on its symptoms and not on its causes .
<en> Has the time not come to tackle the problem of terrorism by looking at the heart of the matter instead of limiting ourselves to its external effects ?
<en> Tackling the heart of the problem means , for example , becoming aware that terrorism is also a direct manifestation of the inability or lack of will of ethnic groups to integrate within the fabric of society in Europe .
<en> I wonder , and I ask Parliament : do we want a debate on terrorism ?
<en> Does Parliament have the courage to face up to a political debate on the level of integration of Muslims in Europe and their willingness to share Western values , rights and freedoms ?
<en> To this end I have tabled a question to the Commission on the burkha to prompt this House to face up to the topic openly .
<en> It seems that no one is willing to deal with the subject .
<en> I wonder , and I ask you , ladies and gentlemen from all the political groups : if the political forum representing the people of Europe cannot express an opinion about these subjects , what can they express an opinion on ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , as a representative of Northern Ireland , I know only too well the terrible impact of terrorism on innocent civilians : murder and mayhem inflicted while people were doing their Saturday shopping in the Shankhill Road in Belfast ; young and old blown up at an act of remembrance to the fallen of the world wars in Enniskillen - acts carried out in the name of Irish Republicanism .
<en> We talk here about the cooperation of the security forces .
<en> From the experience of Northern Ireland , we can see that their contributions prevented many people from losing their lives ; of that I have no doubt .
<en> We need to support our security forces with the equipment they need to prevent terrorism .
<en> Those today who have pitted safety and security against freedom of choice and data protection need to consider where they stand .
<en> Believe me , terrorism destroys lives and shatters communities .
<en> I have even heard in this Chamber today that terrorism is hysteria .
<en> What utter nonsense !
<en> Believe me , when a gunman is trying to take a life , it is a cold and lethal reality - something that my constituents know a lot about .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , I believe that we all agree with the need to protect people and goods and ensure security on public transport .
<en> There are legitimate concerns about body scanners .
<en> I hope that three of them will be resolved by the studies that the Commission is carrying out .
<en> I ask that they conclude them promptly and refer them to Parliament .
<en> Firstly , is it necessary and effective ?
<en> Secondly , is it or is it not harmful to health ?
<en> Thirdly , does it or does it not violate the privacy and dignity of individuals ?
<en> There are , however , other concerns .
<en> Initially we were told that it would be optional .
<en> People could choose between submitting themselves to the scanners or to the old system of a personal check .
<en> It seems , however , that certain Member States are implementing the ' no check , no fly ' principle as obligatory .
<en> I would like to congratulate Commissioner Cecilia Malmström on the comprehensive assessment which she is going to discuss with Parliament , and I would like to stress that we have a responsibility to find solutions which promote security without compromising the rights of individuals .

<en> The next item is the report by Adina-Ioana Vălean , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community and repealing Regulation ( EC ) No 736 / 96 - C7-0125 / 2009 - .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - Madam President , I fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening .
<en> I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report .
<en> The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy .
<en> I believe this is an area where , if Member States work together , Europe can ensure secure , cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens .
<en> Together , we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events , such as the gas disruption Europe experienced last winter .
<en> Of course , Europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes , but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures , and make the market more transparent and efficient .
<en> Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda .
<en> Last year , we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market .
<en> A regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in Parliament and tomorrow 's vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable .
<en> In this context , I think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers , by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> It is a very important institutional , political and legal point .
<en> This regulation is not only a tool for collecting information ; it can also give an overall picture of investments in energy infrastructure as a basis for policy making .
<en> So , in the event that the Council adopts this regulation on the wrong legal basis , I consider that Parliament should pursue this matter further at the European Court of Justice , and let me assure you , it will .
<en> On the substance now ; I have said this before to Mr Barroso and I will say it again to you , Commissioner Oettinger : Europe is standing at a turning point and our priority now should be more than ever to support our companies and create a positive environment for competitiveness .
<en> We therefore need strong policies and especially a stronger reliable energy policy .
<en> The aim in the end is to ensure secure and cheap energy for both our citizens and our companies .
<en> In this perceptive , I should hope that gathering data will not become a purpose in itself .
<en> We have to make sure that this regulation will not create yet another bureaucratic burden on companies and that confidentiality of commercially sensitive information will be reinforced .
<en> On another issue , I can only regret that the PPE and S & D Groups introduced an amendment requiring EU companies to provide data on investments in projects in third countries .
<en> I challenge anyone to find the legal basis in the treaties that would allow extra-territoriality in energy policy .
<en> Furthermore , I believe we should first start proving that we know what is planned at European level before looking outside our borders .
<en> I have also noticed the temptation in this House to include everything in this regulation .
<en> I think that this is a mistake .
<en> For this instrument to be efficient , we must focus on real consistent information and keep in mind avoiding too much bureaucracy and confidentiality issues for our companies and the Commission .
<en> I have tried to achieve this balance by , on the one hand , giving the Commission the opportunity of having an overview of possible future developments but also , on the other hand , ensuring that this picture is as accurate as possible .
<en> We also need some certainty about future investments to ensure proper and solid policy making .
<en> I would also need to be reassured , Commissioner Oettinger .
<en> I want to avoid a situation where the Commission , having gathered the data , starts imposing investment plans and ends up telling companies not to invest here but there .
<en> However , it should provide solutions and incentives for companies to make short-term non-profitable investments which may be needed to ensure security of supply , otherwise the loopholes will remain .
<en> I am stopping here .
<en> Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your comments .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , Mrs Vălean , honourable Members , the gas crisis at the beginning of last year showed us how important it is for Europe to have an energy infrastructure in place that not only promotes the functioning of the internal market , but that also enables solidarity between the Member States and the regions affected in the event of a crisis .
<2en> It is therefore important for the Commission to get an overview of what new investment projects are planned or are under construction and which old installations are to be permanently taken out of service .
<2en> Thus , our proposal is to develop and rework an information instrument that originated at the time of another crisis , namely , the first oil price crisis .
<2en> This proposal aims to extend the area of application of the regulation , in particular , in the areas of renewable energies and CCS .
<2en> We welcome the proposals that have come from within Parliament to include areas of application such as district heating networks or gas , coal and oil production capacities .
<2en> We also want to take account of existing reporting obligations , provided the information available within the context of the analyses that are to be carried out by the Commission is useable .
<2en> ( Loss of sound )
<sp>
<en> We would like to try again and see if it works with the German .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , honourable Members , I raised the issue of how the Commission wants to evaluate the information that it obtains from the Member States in the context of this regulation .
<2en> Our analyses will firstly look at the anticipated development of the infrastructure in terms of the expected changes in demand .
<2en> We will consider whether the new capacities that are expected will match the forecasts of future demand or whether we can expect shortfalls .
<2en> In this regard , unlike in the current regulation , it would seem important for institutional talks on these subject areas to be introduced .
<2en> The Commission therefore proposes , firstly , to publish a report every two years on structural developments in energy infrastructure .
<2en> This is intended to help to improve transparency for all market operators .
<2en> Secondly , we also want a political debate with Parliament and the Member States in order to draw conclusions from this .
<2en> I would like to emphasise that last point , because one thing is clear : the regulation itself is an instrument for collecting and gathering information in order to show us if any action needs to be taken .
<2en> How we go about this needs to be dealt with in the context of specific energy policy initiatives .
<2en> This brings me to the point , Mrs Vălean , that is of interest to you and to the entire House , namely the new Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon and its application .
<2en> For all of us - Parliament , the Council and the Commission - this article represents both an opportunity and an obligation to shape EU energy policy in close cooperation - in other words , together with the European Parliament in particular .
<2en> As the new Commissioner for Energy , I would therefore like to involve this House extensively in all future policy measures as far as possible and at an early stage .
<2en> However , the legal act to which today 's debate refers only concerns the collection and evaluation of information in the energy sector and therefore is based , according to the Commission 's interpretation , on Articles 337 and 187 of the Euratom Treaty .
<2en> The content of the regulation complies with both of these articles of primary law and , in accordance with case law , the choice of legal basis for secondary law must be linked to measurable criteria relating to content .
<2en> No energy policy is established by the collection and evaluation of information alone , which is why , in my view , a decision is needed here .
<2en> I beg your indulgence in this regard .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Given the importance of an integrated energy policy , not only in combating climate change and reducing CO2 emissions , but also in ensuring efficiency and less energy dependence within Europe , communication and transmission of information about investments and energy infrastructure projects is crucial .
<2en> It is vital for European energy policy that the Commission has a current view of trends in energy investments within the Member States so as to be able to develop integrated policies to promote greater energy efficiency and investment in cleaner technologies , thus ensuring progressive energy independence in the face of external suppliers and fossil fuels .
<2en> In view of this , I support the proposal for a regulation , particularly with regard to its necessary implementation , which did not happen with the regulation that it seeks to replace .
<sp>
<2en> This proposal for a regulation contributes to establishing a European energy policy that aims at efficiency , reliability and security .
<2en> Energy efficiency is a priority policy for the European Union given the need to preserve and maximise resources and fulfil the commitments that it has made in combating climate change .
<2en> I would remind you that before moving on to new projects , the EU 's objective of achieving the target of 20 % for energy efficiency must be taken into account .
<2en> This means that investment projects in energy infrastructures must be compatible with the aim of achieving a minimum of 20 % of energy from sustainable , renewable sources by 2020 .
<2en> The energy policy that is being advocated must ensure low carbon emissions and be based on solidarity and sustainability .
<2en> The reliability of the system is important , as operation must be continuous .
<2en> It must take account of the deterioration of the energy sector in terms of supply , which can be seen both inside and outside the EU .
<2en> It is also worth paying attention to crucial investment in infrastructure that manages to avoid security problems in terms of energy supply .
<sp>
<2en> The rapporteur considers that this is indeed an important piece of the puzzle in the EU energy policy , reasoning that we cannot effectively promote a European energy policy at EU level without having adequate information about our energy infrastructure .
<2en> Yet , beyond our fundamental disagreement about European energy policy , this report can also be placed within a legal context , or within the framework of the internal market .
<2en> However , some positive aspects are also considered here , particularly when it states that it is essential that the confidentiality of information is ensured and that any resulting proposals are neutral and do not amount to market intervention on a political level .
<2en> Furthermore , the reporting requirements should be easy to fulfil , so as to avoid any unnecessary administrative burden on undertakings , and the administration of Member States or of the Commission .
<2en> Hence our final decision to abstain .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Vălean report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community .
<2en> Indeed , it is crucial to have a sufficiently detailed overview in order to strike a better balance between the supply and demand of energy at European level and to decide on the shrewdest investments in terms of infrastructure .
<2en> This will also make it possible to increase transparency on the markets ( while protecting corporate data ) and to prevent the phenomena of energy dependence with regard to one particular source or site of supply .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Despite the disappointment of Copenhagen , the EU cannot allow the lack of international consensus to slow down our own efforts in effecting a sustainable energy policy .
<en> The Scottish Government is continuing to pioneer in the field of renewable energy and the EU has an important role , too , in driving forward the agenda .
<en> The effective promotion of our energy policy requires adequate information on infrastructure and I voted accordingly today .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> By supporting the resolution adopted today by a very large majority ( 536 votes to 80 , with 33 abstentions ) , the French delegation of the Democratic Movement has repeated its wish to have an impact assessment and practical proposals from the European Commission on the creation of taxes on financial transactions .
<2en> We call on the Commission to draft a proposal in order to define a common European position to be presented to the G20 in June .
<2en> It would also be a good idea to evaluate the extent to which a tax such as this could help to stabilise the financial markets .
<2en> The questions to which the Commission should provide answers concern the use of this tax to support developing countries ' adaptation to climate change and the financing of development cooperation , but also the levers that the Commission could use to persuade its partners to join it in implementing this tax so as to prevent the migration of capital .
<2en> Above all , however , an in-depth impact assessment must be carried out to ensure that this tax will not reduce the Union 's competitiveness or sustainable investment , nor have negative repercussions for SMEs and individual investors .
<sp>
<2en> In 2000 , I tabled with the Globalisation Intergroup the first resolution calling for the Commission to examine the feasibility of a tax on speculative capital flows .
<2en> The resolution was not adopted , since it was just short of the number of votes required .
<2en> Ten years have passed , the G20 , like several Member States , is no longer ruling out the idea of such a tax , and above all , the financial crisis has served to remind us of the damage that volatile financial markets can cause .
<2en> That is why I welcome the adoption by a wide margin of the resolution on taxes on financial transactions .
<2en> This is only a small step , but the message is clear .
<2en> Parliament is calling on the Commission to finally take up the issue and to work on an implementation project .
<2en> A tax such as this would have the twin advantage of helping to stabilise the markets and of generating huge revenues to help developing countries finance their adaptation to climate change and the fight against poverty .
<2en> Objectors tell us that it will only be effective if it is global , but make a start we must , as some countries have done with the tax on flight tickets .
<2en> A waitandsee policy will get us nowhere .
<2en> We must show the way .
<sp>
<2en> The financial sector has to accept its responsibilities for the economic crisis that still plagues us .
<2en> Up to now , the real economy , taxpayers , consumers , public services and society in general have been the ones paying for a substantial part of the costs and consequences of the financial crisis .
<2en> There are several Member States that have called for a tax on financial transactions .
<2en> The political and regulatory context in this area is different nowadays .
<2en> There are new regulatory initiatives , such as the fight against tax havens , the removal of legal loopholes from management accounts , the requirements applicable to stock market transactions and the use of transaction repositories for the register of derived instruments .
<2en> The European Union must adopt a common position in the international framework of meetings of the G20 .
<2en> In order to do this , the Commission must assess the impact of a global tax on financial transactions before the next G20 summit .
<2en> This assessment must specifically evaluate the effects of the introduction of the tax on financial transactions in the European Union , as opposed to its introduction at global level .
<2en> Costs have to be determined , as well as whether this tax will contribute to the stabilisation of financial markets .
<sp>
<2en> The various statements made in the preamble to the resolution now approved by a majority of Parliament are positive to see .
<2en> This is particularly true of the statement that the financial sector must take a fair share of the burden of economic recovery and development , given that up until it now it has been the real economy of taxpayers , consumers , public services and society in general which has had to pay a substantial part of the costs and consequences of the financial crisis .
<2en> However , beyond this , there was almost regret for any action which might help to lead to a possible tax on financial transactions , through the attachment of many constraints to the application of the resolution .
<2en> That is why we abstained .
<2en> Regrettably , there has been a delay in applying new regulatory initiatives and in advancing the promised fight against tax havens , the removal of legal omissions regarding management accounts , the requirements applicable to stock market transactions and the use of trade repositories for the registration of derivative instruments .
<2en> It is necessary to make decisive progress and not continue in these muddy waters , which only serve to help financial speculators and large capitalist interests .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I support a tax of financial transactions , and I am very pleased that this initiative is gaining such support .
<en> In order to be effective , it should be a global tax , and I support measures to introduce such a charge on financial transactions .

<en> ( PL ) Madam President , we remember Fidel Castro 's famous cry of ' socialism or death ' .
<en> Today , we can safely say that , from this cry , only death remains .
<en> Proof of this are the circumstances which led to the death of the Cuban prisoner and patriot , Orlando Zapata .
<en> Castro 's dictatorial rule is a disgrace to the idea of democratic socialism .
<en> What is happening in Cuba brings disgrace upon all who are involved in politics under these Left-wing banners .
<en> I was ashamed of the European Union , too , when the then Commissioner , Mr Michel , visited Cuba with a proposal of cooperation on development , but carefully avoided contact with the democratic opposition .
<en> We must end this kind of policy , this closing our eyes to the reality of a country in which there have never been free elections , and where prisoners of conscience are serving prison sentences of many years in scandalous conditions .
<en> The Spanish Presidency is , today , proposing operating an open policy towards Havana , but an essential condition of this policy must be democratisation of the Cuban regime , release of political prisoners , commencement of dialogue with society , lifting of censorship and restoration of civil liberties .
<en> This should be clearly , openly and firmly said to the government in Cuba .
<en> Besides , it is in their interest .
<en> We know there are different ways to freedom for people oppressed by dictators .
<en> There is the path taken by Poland and South Africa - the way of dialogue and understanding .
<en> However , there is also the path which Romania took in its bloody overthrow of the regime .
<en> It is in everyone 's interest to avoid such a scenario .
<en> Which path will Havana choose ?
<en> The key to this is to be found in Cuba .
<en> The policy of the European Union should actively contribute to leading Cuba into the area of freedom and democracy .
<en> This , too , should be the position of the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , firstly I want to express my own deep sympathy for the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo and my deepest concern for the four further Cuban prisoners and one opposition activist who have themselves started hunger strikes in protest .
<en> The European Parliament should reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of prisoners of conscience in Cuba - 55 according to Amnesty International , 200 according to Cuba 's Human Rights Commission - and we should express particular concern today for the recent detention and beating of Darsi Ferrer , director of a health and human rights centre in Havana .
<en> Amnesty International itself has not been invited to visit Cuba for 19 years and should be allowed to do so .
<en> We should ask the Cuban Government to agree specific dates for the proposed visit of Manfred Nowak , UN Special Rapporteur on Torture , who we intend to meet in Geneva next week .
<en> As I am one of the people in this House who has always opposed the US embargo on trade , inflicted since 1962 , I have welcomed the fact that under President Obama , measures have been approved to allow Cuban Americans to travel more freely as well as sending more money home .
<en> I welcomed the review in 2008 of our EU common position leading to the establishment of a political dialogue between Cuba and the EU and re-establishing EC development cooperation , and I welcome the fact that the BBC has recently been given free access to Cuba .
<en> But I express disappointment that , in the United Nations Human Rights Council , Cuba has failed to agree the recommendations to ratify the two key human rights conventions - the ICCPR and the ICESCR - and to allow independent inspection of prisons .
<en> I say to the Commission and to the Presidency this afternoon that you - and all of us who visit Cuba - should remain firm in ensuring that we meet members of Cuban civil society .
<en> US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State , Bisa Williams , was able to undertake such an unrestricted visit last year and we should insist - any of us that go to Cuba - that we do the same .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , Minister , the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo is tragic evidence of the despair to which a lack or an absence of freedom can lead .
<en> As the Minister said , this clearly should not have happened .
<en> We must denounce the detention of prisoners of conscience and demand their release .
<en> We cannot support the arbitrariness of a power that obstinately refuses to embrace the exercising of the most fundamental freedoms , but it is my belief that we cannot deprive ourselves of the virtues of , and prospects for , a political dialogue , which , now more than ever , remains the most tangible expression of our European values .
<en> Relations between Cuba and the European Union have been complex for a very long time now ; often , they are based on a lack of awareness and of understanding , which has led to serious tensions and which regularly undermines the advances in and prospects for political dialogue .
<en> We all know that Cuba is today at a turning point in its history .
<en> More than ever , I remain convinced that we would be wrong not to preserve the advantages and advances , however modest , of a dialogue sustained by particular historical , cultural and linguistic links .
<en> The European Union is , without doubt , the only political power capable of convincing the Cubans that the isolation in which they are confining themselves is suicidal and can only lead them , sooner or later , to a tragic fate .
<en> We cannot shirk this responsibility that we have to pursue the dialogue without excluding any of the difficult issues but also without applying - as I believe is all too often the case - double standards .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Liberty will triumph in Cuba .
<en> There will be democracy there , and there will be a free-market economy .
<en> The European Union cannot help in bringing down the regime and , I suppose , does not want to , but it should want and should be able to help the Cubans after the system has been changed .
<en> The experiences of countries like Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Hungary show that this can be done , and that it can be successful .
<en> We can help with our experience , and after Castro 's overthrow , the European Union should help with its experience and its money , so that Cuba never reaches the situation , described by Polish commentator , Marek Magierowski , in which in the future , the descendants of Orlando Zapata , of whom frequent mention has been made in this Chamber , serve rum on the promenades and boulevards of Havana to the descendants of Castro .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) I am originally a doctor by profession and I know how difficult it is to save human life .
<en> I sincerely regret any waste of human life and I share your sorrow over the death of Orlando Zapata .
<en> I have carefully examined all of the proposed resolutions of the political groups .
<en> I am afraid I must repeat what I said when we were recently debating the report into the human rights situation in the Central Asian republics .
<en> I said then that we were making a mistake in setting ourselves up as mentors with nothing good to say and showing no respect for the specific historical and cultural traditions of these countries , not even for the positive results which these countries have achieved .
<en> The same applies to Cuba .
<en> I firmly believe that the only way to improve the situation in Cuba is through a dialogue of equals , which Cuban officials are ready for .
<en> In this way , we can also help to improve social and economic rights in Cuba .
<en> We must not forget that Cuba , despite its difficult economic situation , is always in the first rank of countries providing assistance to others , for example , in the disaster in Haiti .
<en> It is true that he who is quick to condemn likes to condemn .
<en> We should definitely not take this path .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - There is not much to say on this report that is not self explanatory .
<en> Clearly , more than any other time , there is a need for financial institutions to pause and reassess their approach .
<en> In the last two weeks , two former high ranking officials in Ireland 's biggest bank have been arrested in dawn raids .
<en> This is a dramatic statement of the need for responsible and moral financial management .
<en> There is just one point I would like to make , and that is the greater need for transparency in our financial institutions , be it at regional , national or EU level .
<en> This report calls for greater transparency which I am sure the majority of MEPs will support
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the work of the rapporteur Edward Scicluna .
<en> I particularly draw attention to the emphasis his report places on the importance of economic growth as the best means to tackle excessive deficits .
<en> This is a clear response to those who argue for an undue focus on short-term cuts to expenditure , which could in fact jeopardise longer-term growth .
<en> Deficits must be steadily reduced over the coming years , as the economy recovers from the effects of the financial crisis , but growing our way out of the crisis is the only effective option to secure long-term fiscal sustainability and protect citizens .
<sp>
<2en> I shall vote against this report , which blindly promotes the neoliberal logic that is responsible for the economic , social and environmental crisis , the consequences of which we are all suffering .
<2en> The text proposed to us is not only extremely dogmatic , it also shows contempt for the peoples , in particular , for the Greek people .
<2en> How can Parliament vote for a text that is so shameful that it calls into question Greece 's entry into the euro area in the light of the budget deficit created by the policies that it supports ?
<2en> Clearly , this Europe is yet another enemy of the people .
<sp>
<2en> The serious economic crisis that the entire world is suffering simultaneously is making itself felt extremely sharply in the EU .
<2en> The response of the European Central Bank to the crisis was effective , although it was guilty at times of acting late or with a lack of assertiveness , in particular , the policy of reducing interest rates , which was more radical and effective in the United Kingdom and the US Federal Reserve .
<2en> We must learn lessons from the mistakes made so that they can be avoided in the future .
<2en> It should be pointed out that the Treaty of Lisbon has made the ECB an EU institution .
<2en> This has meant an increase in Parliament 's responsibility , since this House has become the institution through which the ECB is now held to account before the European public
<sp>
<2en> Like the vast majority of this House , I voted in favour of this report .
<2en> The subject matter was not controversial and there were no amendments during the plenary session that could subvert the report 's basic content .
<sp>
<2en> The ECB Annual Report 2008 reflects the causes and circumstances of the crisis well .
<2en> The year 2008 , which saw the beginning of the acute phase of the biggest economic crisis for several decades , determined the ways in which the world economy and the European economy would develop for a long time to come .
<2en> For the European Central Bank , the last two years were , without doubt , the most difficult period in its history .
<2en> The ECB had to tackle a crisis which had hit the European economy severely .
<2en> Rising budget deficits in Member States combined with growing debt are the primary macro-economic consequences of the crisis .
<2en> In accordance with the treaty , the ECB is primarily responsible for ' price stability ' , which means low inflation .
<2en> Has the ECB fulfilled its role ?
<2en> It is hard to be sure .
<2en> It is true that the current level of inflation is below the ceiling fixed by the ECB , but it should be pointed out that in the first months of the crisis it jumped to its highest ever level in the euro area , only to fall , suddenly , later .
<2en> I think , however , that this instability can be explained by the surprise which the crisis caused .
<2en> From October 2008 onwards , the ECB 's monetary policy can be described as active and flexible .
<2en> The ECB adopted a different strategy for the crisis than other leading central banks around the world .
<2en> We are still waiting for the results of these actions .
<2en> Europe is coming out of the crisis , but the situation is still uncertain .
<2en> Is the ECB ready for the possibility of another crisis , a possibility which is seen by some economists ?
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome this report by my colleague , Edward Scicluna , who has presented a well-considered view and indeed worked hard to get the resolution down to just one vote .
<en> In this respect , there has to be much in the way of compromise and this tends to disguise the differences which also exist .
<en> I am particularly concerned that , at a time when questions are being asked about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of the USA , similar searching questions are missing from our debate concerning the ECB .
<en> Of particular concern is the relevance of micro-supervisory oversight and whether the ECB , by dint of its role in the recent crisis , is automatically qualified to be involved so directly in this endeavour or whether it will carry with it significant reputational risk .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , to pick up on the references made earlier to the handling of the Greek problem , all of us who are closely following developments in and the handling of these problems realise , and many of us have the feeling , that the Council has elbowed the Commission aside .
<en> The Commission was , from the beginning I think , a balancing factor for the medium-sized and smaller Member States of the Union towards the Council .
<en> Today , I think that its role in the issues faced by Greece , but not just Greece , is confined to action and statements of a technocratic nature .
<en> My specific question is this : we are talking about the economy , about monetary union with more acute supranational elements .
<en> We are also talking about the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy being prepared by the Commission and we are talking about combating unemployment and poverty .
<en> How , when the Commission does not have the role that befits it , will it be possible to implement these ambitious strategies ?
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - The issue of employment , as you know , is dependent on the overall economic situation .
<en> Let us be completely clear about it .
<en> We cannot restore the levels of employment that we had before the crisis before we come back to more growth in Europe .
<en> That is why we are concentrating our efforts on the new sources of growth and , in fact , trying to restore this growth that is critically important for the European Union .
<en> That is our priority now .
<en> That said , there were some measures that were taken specifically for employment .
<en> We have some proposals in our EU 2020 strategy for new skills , for new jobs , for programmes for youth , but the basic thing is to restore the conditions for growth , including confidence in our economy .
<en> When it comes to the Greek situation , as you know , a lot has to do with the confidence also in the future of the Greek economy .
<en> That is why it is so much dependent on the correction of some fiscal imbalances .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , President of the Commission , the employment situation in Europe is very worrying , as my fellow Members have just pointed out .
<en> In 2009 , 2.7 million people in the euro area lost their jobs .
<en> Furthermore , the poverty risk rate for the population with a job has risen to 8 % of workers in Europe , not to mention the fact that nearly 17 % of the population live below the poverty threshold .
<en> Faced with this situation , do you not think that a two-pronged strategy ought to be implemented ?
<en> On the one hand , by reinforcing decent work - it would have been worth including this issue , rather than employment strictly for growth 's sake , in the 2020 strategy ; moreover , are you counting on promoting the creation of green , intelligent jobs to develop a sustainable , united society ? - and , on the other , by increasing the overall employment rate in Europe , with particular emphasis on jobs for young people - you talked about this - but also for the over-fifties .
<en> In this regard , the increase in requests made to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the restructuring in various sectors highlight the need to develop a global industrial policy .
<sp>
<2en> All the issues you have raised are dealt with in the 2020 strategy , Mr Daerden .
<2en> I already talked about decent work in my political guidelines , just as I talked about the existence of a genuine industrial policy for Europe - not the old industrial policy , but a policy aimed at providing Europe with sustainable industry , a more modern , sustainability-focused policy .
<2en> As far as young people are concerned , at least two of the flagship initiatives are devoted to them , that is to say , the ' Youth on the move ' and the ' New skills for new jobs ' initiatives .
<2en> We have highlighted a number of objectives , for example , in relation to education , the fight against poverty and the campaign for social inclusion .
<2en> This aspect appears in the 2020 strategy , precisely because we consider that the fight against unemployment is now the main priority .
<2en> I believe that the development of this strategy will enable us to achieve significant results in the fight against unemployment .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , over the last few years , unemployment has increased throughout all the countries of Europe - albeit in different forms from one country to the next - and is destined to increase further .
<en> Economists all agree that it will take at least two years for the tentative signs of recovery that are evident here and there to become the norm and that , in any case , for at least 10 years , the recovery will be so limited that it will not create any additional employment .
<en> This means that we will have a rise in unemployment , with job losses among those who are today in employment , and , at the same time , we will have generations of young people who are not and will not be able to enter the labour market .
<en> I ask you whether you do not think it is necessary , faced with such a situation , to promote a measure aimed at guaranteeing a standard income in Europe for all those who lose their jobs , and to regard the issue of young people as a kind of emergency and , hence , to come up with a specific training-related measure that will benefit them , for the entire time in which they remain outside the labour market .

<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I would just like to inform you that the amendment to paragraph 8 by the GUE / NGL Group and the Verts / ALE Group has the same wording as in the resolution of September 2009 .
<en> I would just like to inform you that it is just the same position , and I do not think that there is a need to change this position before the negotiations on SWIFT .
<sp>
<en> author . - Mr President , I would just like to inform colleagues that we did not change our position : it has always been incorporated throughout the text in this resolution , so the proposed amendment is superfluous .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I just think that it is important to ...
<en> ( Interjection from the floor )
<en> I would like not to be disturbed by colleagues on the extreme right , please .
<en> I think that they would also like to be informed on this issue - the issue is whether or not to transfer bulk data to the United States ; that is the issue in Amendment 8 .
<en> We have been discussing whether we are against or for the position , but it is good to know .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function .
<2en> It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used , whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them , and whether any resources are being wasted .
<2en> Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
<2en> That is why I voted for the report on the implementation of the European Union general budget , Section I - European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We followed the rapporteur , Staes , in this vote , even though we lost one key amendment , number 22 , on the transparency of the use of public funds , defended by the same rapporteur .
<sp>
<2en> I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public , which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used .
<2en> The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the European Economic and Social Committee ( EESC ) .
<2en> Nevertheless , the Court of Auditors points to some situations where there has been no improvement , such as the reimbursement of the travel expenses of members of the EESC , which must be based on no more than their true costs , or the fact that the EESC grants its staff a financial advantage not granted by the other institutions , and that that results in higher expenses .
<2en> I note with satisfaction the fact that the EESC has adopted the practice of including a chapter in its annual activity report describing how the previous discharge decisions of Parliament and the Court of Auditors were followed up .
<sp>
<2en> All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function .
<2en> It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used , whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them , and whether any resources are being wasted .
<2en> Generally - with only a few exceptions , to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
<2en> That is why I voted for the report on the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2008 , Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee .
<sp>
<2en> I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public , which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used .
<2en> Parliament 's evaluation of the accounts submitted and their respective discharge falls into this category .
<2en> I note with satisfaction that the report of the Court of Auditors mentions that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the Committee of the Regions ( CoR ) .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur 's positive assessment of the improvements found in the CoR 's internal control environment , in particular the inventory of its main administrative , operational and financial procedures .
<2en> Lastly , I note with satisfaction the quality of the CoR 's annual activity report , especially the explicit inclusion of how the previous discharge decisions of Parliament and the Court of Auditors were followed up , highlighting the importance and relevance of these decisions .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> We still have three explanations of votes remaining .
<sp>
<en> - Mr President , I welcome the fact that the total amount of irregularities in the way European funds are being used is declining .
<en> The fact that the amount of irregularities in the agricultural sector fell so dramatically by 34 % is especially encouraging .
<en> A strong and competitive role for OLAF is among the factors that helped to improve the situation .
<en> I welcome the proposal enshrined in our resolution to increase cooperation among EU Member States in the area of taxation .
<en> However , I want to express my deep concern about the fact that fraudulent activities increased in the new Member States , especially Romania and Bulgaria .
<en> In EU-10 they grew by 8 % while debt for the EU-2 increased by 152 % .
<en> I want to express my strong support for the calls on Romania and Bulgaria to build up their administrative capacity to manage EU funding and improve the supervision and transparency of public procurement procedures at all levels .
<sp>
<en> - Mr President , first of all I would like to thank Mr Deutsch for his excellent report .
<en> Today 's substantive discussion and our resolution , which I supported , is an excellent starting point for the future activities of the European Investment Bank , especially taking into account the EU 2020 Strategy .
<en> In addition , I would like once again to urge the European governments to provide the EIB with a more significant lending capacity to our neighbours , especially those in the east , who are highly in need of loans and investments , and who are also suffering from the effects of the crisis .
<en> Compatibility between the policy goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the lending directions of the EIB should be ensured in the future even more than before .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , in January and March we witnessed mass atrocities in Nigeria which caused the deaths of several hundred people , including women and children .
<en> What is necessary for Nigeria is first of all a reconciliation process and the peaceful coexistence between Muslims living in the north and Christians living in the south .
<en> Secondly , taking into account that , despite Nigeria being one of the biggest oil producers in the world , most of its people still live in poverty .
<en> They do not benefit from the overall development of the country so corruption , which is widespread , has to be challenged and fought effectively and seriously .
<en> Thirdly , European Union assistance to Nigeria should address the most important problems , the most sensitive issues in order to achieve at least some visible progress in this country .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , the latest news I received this week about Christians in Jos sounds extremely worrying .
<en> In recent weeks , too , our co-religionists - Christians , that is - have been found murdered in various places in this Nigerian city .
<en> For example , on Saturday 24 April , members of a gang of Muslim youths stabbed to death two journalists working for a Christian monthly .
<en> The perpetrators used the mobile phones of their victims to call the latter 's unsuspecting friends and relatives and say , ' We have killed them all , come and see . '
<en> Mr President , this is typical of an atmosphere of violence with impunity in Nigeria of which Christians are the main victims , and which has resulted in hundreds of deaths in and around Jos since the start of this year .
<en> Significantly , one observer has spoken of systematic religious persecution .
<en> Hence his appeal to the international community - and thus also to the European institutions - to recognise Islamic extremism as a key explanation for the explosive situation in Nigeria , particularly in the case of Jos , which lies at the crossroads between the Muslim north and the Christian south .
<en> Unfortunately - and this is also my criticism today - this is what the joint motion for a resolution explicitly does not do ( see paragraph 5 ) .
<en> The motion for a resolution fails to take a firm line on the Islamic extremism prevailing in Nigeria ; worse still , it opposes - and I quote - ' simplistic explanations based only on religion ' .
<en> I too oppose single-cause explanations , but this oversimplification on the part of the EU , of this House , does not help the Nigerian Christians , whose lives are poised between hope and fear these days , in the slightest .
<en> That is my criticism , and that is why I abstained .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Mr President , with all due respect to you and to this institution , the debate on the adaptation of the Rules of Procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon should also include a mention of the shortcoming in the Rules of Procedure which has made it possible to have a vote such as this and an outcome such as the election of Mr Tőkés to the role of Vice-President .
<en> I cannot understand how the Presidents can issue a disputed vote , and therefore the disputed outcome of a vote , and I sympathise with all of my fellow Members who have doubts as to whether their votes were correctly counted .
<en> From this perspective , I believe that the European Union and the European Parliament should act transparently and clearly , and as long as some Members feel that their votes have been treated by the voting equipment differently to the way they voted , and they did not have the possibility to check it on their monitors , then the vote will continue to be controversial .
<en> From this perspective , I believe that it is in the interests of Mr Tőkés , and in the interests of the credibility of the European Parliament , to actually return to this vote and to vote again , so that there can be no doubt in the future concerning the election of the Vice-President of the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the cancer from Greece is metastasising across the Mediterranean .
<en> We read this week that the European Commission is preparing to bail out Spain , and the President of the European Council , Mr Van Rompuy , frankly admits that in this event , the EUR 750 billion already set aside in the emergency bail-out fund would be wholly inadequate .
<en> As the tumour spreads , rather than contemplating amputation , our leaders have decided on a lengthy course of chemotherapy which will be expensive and painful and of uncertain outcome .
<en> What I mean by that is that they will try to create the machinery of what Mr Van Rompuy calls economic governance and what his predecessor called fiscal federalism : tax harmonisation , a levy on financial transactions , a European debt agency or a European monetary fund .
<en> All these machines to try and transfer money so as to keep their project around when , of course , much the easier thing would be to excuse the taxpayers the burden of this bail-out and to give the stricken economies the massive stimulus of allowing themselves to devalue and price themselves into the market .
<en> What a high price we expect from our people in order to humour the conceits of their elites !
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on the occasion of the 2000 Millennium Summit , the richest countries , including the countries of the European Union , renewed their pledge to achieve certain specific goals by 2015 : to reduce hunger and poverty , to improve education and health , and to protect the environment in developing countries .
<en> Almost 10 years on , we believe that Europe , as the main international player in the field of development assistance , must now , more than ever , assume a leading role .
<en> There is no doubt that over the last few years , increases in development assistance have helped to relieve the suffering of millions of people .
<en> Whilst it is true that the assistance is working , much still remains to be done , not least given that the current international crisis will force many Member States to reduce their own aid budgets to these countries .
<en> Mr President , I voted in favour of this report because I believe that at this moment in time , we need to explore innovative financing mechanisms .
<en> The EU Member States must start to take strategic partnerships of a political nature with these countries seriously .
<en> This means that all the partners must demonstrate a renewed political will to achieve the priority objectives , which are still : policy coherence for development , tackling climate change and the global crisis , governance and rights , the right to food , and development education .
<en> This remains our number one challenge , Mr President .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the Cashman report because I believe it is the responsibility of this House and of the European institutions to abide by and uphold the commitments made to people who live in less developed countries , in particular , the countries of Africa .
<en> We cannot get to 2015 and realise that the eight goals that we set ourselves have not been achieved , because behind the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , behind these percentages - let us not forget this - there are billions of people who are suffering and do not have the opportunity to live in dignity .
<en> The European Union must set an example and lead the way as far as development assistance is concerned .
<en> Public debt cancellation , together with a greater commitment to ensuring that aid is put to good use , is one of the key points of this solidarity-based project , the achievement of which - we have to be aware - cannot be postponed without sacrificing more human lives .

<2en> Pal Schmitt , Vice-President of the European Parliament , having been recently elected as president of the newly elected Hungarian parliament , my colleagues and I had to elect a new vice-president .
<2en> As László Tőkés , Hungarian member of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , meets all the criteria needed in order to perform such a function ( integrity , commitment , support for the European construct ) , I voted in favour of his candidature .

<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I fully support efforts to make the activities of sports agents , mainly in football , more transparent and I believe that the EU should be supporting the various sporting governing bodies to ensure that they can do just that .
<en> We need to shine a light into the murky world where exploitation could be rife and matters such as dual representation , whereby the agent can be representing a player at the same club that is trying to sign the player , need to be looked at .
<en> However , any legislation that comes forward to regulate this sector must be from the national sporting bodies or authorities such as FIFA and UEFA .
<en> It is really not the place of the EU to be regulating in the sporting world , especially with the global nature of this particular problem .
<en> Where we can add value to sports we should , but we should only intervene upon the request of the sporting governing bodies where we can clearly deliver value or give clarity .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I welcome the question raised by our President in the middle of the World Cup .
<2en> The Commission study has worrying aspects , in that it exposes the risk to the ethics and reputation of sport .
<2en> If the sporting movement is to remain the main player in regulation , by relying on the thousands of charitable men and women who keep alive the sporting spirit as we love it , because is it a factor in individual development , the States should be at their side to punish attacks on public order and to punish excesses .
<2en> These excesses are found in the sports business , in which players are increasingly becoming commodities and their agents simply brokers , placing them just like commodities .
<2en> Transfers command astronomical sums and the rights of minors are increasingly trampled upon .
<2en> These excesses are a cross-border phenomenon , it is money as king , crazy money , and has unfortunately been strengthened by the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
<2en> The leading bodies of certain sports in question , especially football , are looking for aid from European bodies .
<2en> Yes , Commissioner , we need to act and , for my part , I am sorry that France has just passed legislation to the contrary .
<sp>
<en> ( GA ) Mr President , an hour and a half ago , the women were saying that it was late to be discussing women 's issues .
<en> Now we are approaching midnight and we are discussing sporting matters .
<en> However , at least we have the opportunity to discuss this ; before Lisbon , we did not .
<en> Now we have the opportunity and it is good that we are taking it , particularly when we are talking of young people and of the activities of sports agents .
<en> As Mrs Pack said , there are many examples of young people who are promised that they will be big stars in the future .
<en> But what happens ?
<en> They are taken from their homes , from their families , from schools , and then a year or two later , they are discarded .
<en> This is what happens to the majority of them .
<en> Now the European Union has a chance to do something about this and to lay down laws and penalties to protect young people from these agents .
<en> We should look at what is going on in different sports and in different countries , compile this information and do the best thing - particularly for young people and for sport as a whole .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , the profession of sports agent is one with no safeguards and little or no supervision , let alone penalties for misconduct , for example , human trafficking .
<en> The EU has carried out a study and identified abuses but , as yet , has failed to do anything about the situation .
<en> Yet something must be done .
<en> I am very concerned about the vulnerability of underage players , particularly those from developing countries , who are often victims of human trafficking .
<en> The EU has to clamp down on this .
<en> The resolution presents specific proposals : putting a stop to remuneration for agents of underage players , enforcing more transparency in financial transactions during transfers , and more regulation by Member States given that the sports federations do not have the situation under control at present .
<en> Specific measures are required in order to tackle Wild West conditions .
<en> The Commission must ensure that enforcement and the penalising of malpractice - which , after all , is often cross-border in nature - are improved .
<en> In addition , the rights of underage players must be safeguarded effectively at all times .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) I welcome the initiative suggested by Ivo Belet of setting up a standard system for protecting the interests of sports men and women who use the services of agents , which will reduce incidences of misconduct in this area relating to the lack of transparency with transfers , money laundering and human trafficking .
<en> As I see it , we need to focus appropriate attention not only on football , but on all the other sports as well .
<en> For example , we currently have around 6 000 agents who are active in Europe , representing 30 different sports , involved in business activities with an estimated annual value of hundreds of millions of euro .
<en> In these circumstances , imposing a single code of rules for licensing players ' agents will be far from an easy task .
<en> In addition , we will have to support a clearer definition of the functions of an agent , whether as a manager of players or as an intermediary in transfers .
<en> Looking ahead ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The fight against terrorism must be a priority for the European Union .
<en> Pro-active cooperation with the United States in this context , namely in terms of information and data sharing , is central to increasing efficiency in the fight against terrorism , to prevent future attacks and ensure the security of the European public .
<en> I am therefore voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report .
<en> The amendments made to this agreement not only reflect the majority of concerns expressed by the European Parliament at the time of its rejection on 11 February , but also express the need for proportionality in the treatment of this data , namely as regards their processing , storage and subsequent deletion .
<en> I also emphasise the strengthened guarantees the new agreement gives to European citizens in terms of data protection , namely the right to appeal against judicial and administrative decisions , the right to transparency and communication of information to the citizens in question and the definition of the sphere of the data 's application , restricted to activity directly related to terrorism or its financing .
<sp>
<2en> Six months ago , the European Parliament acted as a defender of fundamental rights by rejecting the agreement between the EU and the US concerning the transfer and processing of banking data - the so-called ' SWIFT ' agreement .
<2en> Thanks to the action of MPs and of our group in particular , a new version was drawn up .
<2en> It contains significant underlying improvements , such as the elimination of ' bulk ' data transfers .
<2en> More protection will therefore be afforded to the rights of individuals , whilst acknowledging the importance of tracking financial data in the fight against terrorism .
<2en> That is why I chose to vote in favour of the new agreement .
<2en> However I will continue to be particularly attentive to the following points : the prerogatives of European data protection authorities and the choice of Europol as screening authority ; the effectiveness of the ' right of redress ' of people whose privacy rights have been flouted ; and the monitoring and evaluation of the relevancy of data transmitted to the American authorities .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the conclusion of the new Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program , because I felt that the new proposal tabled by the Commission offered EU citizens increased assurances , in particular as regards data protection .
<2en> In fact I believe that any transfer of European personal data to a third country for security purposes must respect procedural safeguards and rights of defence as well as comply with applicable national and European data protection legislation .
<2en> A few months ago the first version of the agreement was too vague and did not offer similar guarantees .
<2en> That is why we said ' No ' .
<2en> Today I am delighted that our proposals for improvement have been taken into account , including the introduction of a similar exchange system at European level and the guarantee that follow-up monitoring will be entrusted to European officials who must be able to oppose data extraction on US soil .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I supported the Agreement between the EU and the USA on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data from the EU to the USA for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program .
<en> Thanks to the considerable efforts of the rapporteur and the members of the LIBE Committee , the current text of the agreement contains considerable improvements on the previous version of the agreement .
<en> Of particular importance for the future of combating terrorism whilst protecting the fundamental rights of citizens to protection of their personal data is Article 2 pertaining to the drafting of a legal and technical framework for an EU data extraction capability .
<en> The Commission should carry out this task in an assiduous and timely fashion .
<en> The addition to the agreement of Article 2 has the potential to greatly reduce the quantity of bulk data sent for analysis beyond the EU 's borders .
<en> Articles 15 and 16 ensure that citizens have strengthened access to redress and increased transparency .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the report on the SWIFT agreement on the transfer of bank data to the US , as I believe that the agreement negotiated with the Council and the US now includes safeguards relating to the protection of citizens ' data , eliminating the possibility of transferring raw data to third countries .
<en> This is an important agreement in the fight against terrorism , and it will ensure that the fundamental liberties of European citizens are protected .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour because I think that supporting the agreement negotiated between the European Commission and the United States is the right action to take and the sign of a great sense of responsibility .
<2en> The transfer of personal data is an extremely sensitive issue in Europe , with its painful experiences of totalitarian regimes that would churn out and distort such data .
<2en> Under the new agreement it will be possible to transfer a certain amount of bank data to the US authorities , provided that the transfer complies with the strict rules on personal data protection , which we MEPs are committed to monitoring .
<2en> Such information may be consulted only if it is deemed important for the purposes of conducting counterterrorism investigations : access to it is conditional upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence by the US authorities .
<2en> The new agreement is a victory for all the European institutions , and for our European Parliament in particular .
<2en> Indeed , our requests for increased protection of European citizens ' privacy have been granted , with Europeans being offered a dual guarantee : firstly , complete transparency as regards the way in which their data are accessed and used , and , secondly , proper appeal procedures to ensure that their privacy is protected .
<2en> These are satisfactory guarantees that will ensure that these two requirements - safety and protection of privacy - can both be satisfied and safeguarded .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against this report .
<2en> It is tantamount to approval of United States interference in Europe with the complicity of bodies such as SWIFT .
<2en> It supports the possibility of transferring to the United States the personal data of each and every citizen , so vast is the scope stipulated in the agreement between the Council and the United States .
<2en> It does not call for any genuine guarantee of the protection of these data or opportunities for redress .
<2en> This report and the agreement that it ratifies are a symbol of this Europe 's enslavement by American imperialism .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The fight against terrorism is of concern to the EU , as it is to the entire democratic world .
<en> All mechanisms that help to discover possible attacks are fundamental to this fight 's success .
<en> The SWIFT agreement is a very powerful weapon in the fight against terrorism , as it gives access to privileged financial information regarding financial transfers between countries .
<en> The renegotiation of this agreement with the US is an opportunity for the EU to contribute effectively to the uncovering of new terrorists and potential attacks .
<en> There is currently a great desire for cooperation on the part of the US , facilitating an agreement that efficiently protects transmitted data and where there is maximum possible reciprocity .
<en> The project for solution approved today is a good starting point for the difficult negotiations ahead with the US .
<sp>
<2en> I voted once more against the SWIFT agreement on the processing of European banking data and its transfer to the United States under the pretext of the fight against terrorism , as I believe the United States ' claim to be unacceptable and to be a threat to the freedoms and rights of European citizens .
<2en> Through this proposal , the most conservative forces have tried to hand us over bound hand and foot to US interests without giving a thought to the security or privacy of citizens .
<2en> The European Parliament cannot allow the civil rights and freedoms of Europeans to be adversely affected under the pretext of the fight against terrorism .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) Data protection with the SWIFT agreement is simply a sham .
<en> Storing up limitless data packets over so long a period of time in the absence of any judicial intervention runs counter to our understanding of a modern state founded on the rule of law .
<en> That it should be the European police authority Europol - which has its own interest in data for combating terror - that will monitor compliance with data protection rules and the actual existence of suspicion of terror , is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse .
<en> Furthermore , the idea that the Data Protection Commissioners , which have often shown themselves to be toothless , can obtain a block or a deletion in the USA is downright laughable .
<en> An increase in data protection is thus nowhere near being in prospect , and as a result the SWIFT agreement received a clear ' No ' from me .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the report on the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , as the agreement that has been reached reinforces the Community identity of the EEAS and its political and budgetary responsibility before Parliament .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) In November 2006 , Parliament adopted a resolution which recognised the strategic importance of the European languages of universal communication - English , Spanish , Portuguese and French , in order of number of speakers - as a vehicle for communication and a means to solidarity , cooperation and economic investment .
<en> In 2008 , the European Commission acknowledged that these languages form an important bridge between people and countries in different regions of the world .
<en> At a time when the organisation and functioning of the EEAS is being set out , I believe that it is crucial for it to take full advantage of the communication capacity of the global European languages that I mentioned , and to adopt them as working languages .
<en> The rules and practice governing languages in this service will reveal the extent of its commitment to external communication .
<en> Having said this , I cannot but rejoice at the creation of the EEAS , and I hope that it will produce results to live up to what is hoped of it .
<en> The European Union has much to gain from a competent and efficient EEAS , which is capable of being the EU 's voice on the world stage and actively cooperating with the diplomatic services of Member States .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The goal of the present decision is to establish the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , a body functionally independent of the Union under the authority of the High Representative , created by Article 27 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) , as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> The European Parliament also has a role to play in the Union 's foreign policy , namely in terms of its political control functions ( set out in Article 14 ( 1 ) of the TEU ) , as well as its legislative and budgetary functions assigned in the Treaties .
<en> The High Representative must also regularly consult the European Parliament on the main aspects and fundamental decisions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) and should ensure that Parliament 's positions are duly taken into account ; the EEAS assists the High Representative in this task .
<en> They should make specific provisions in terms of the access of Members of the European Parliament to confidential information in the sphere of the CFSP .
<en> Having no objections to present , I voted in favour of the approval of this decision .
<sp>
<2en> We voted against this report , which is the result of negotiations between the Council and the majority in Parliament on one of the crucial points in the Treaty of Lisbon and a keystone of federalism in the European Union , which now has a legal character , as advocated in the European Constitution .
<2en> It is noted that this service will involve more than 5 000 people in the EU embassies in various countries around the world .
<2en> To exacerbate the situation , we notice that proposals made by our group have not been adopted , in particular those which argue that the EU 's military structures should not be part of the European External Action Service , and that there should not even be any institutional link between them .
<2en> The same thing has happened with regard to the EU intelligence structures .
<2en> The rejection of the proposal that we presented for the Council to cease development and abolish the military and civil-military structures under its jurisdiction , as well as cease funding for military and civil-military activity , is particularly worrying .
<2en> There is therefore much cause for concern over the future of the European Union and the route it is pursuing .
<sp>
<2en> In Laeken nine years ago , during the previous Belgian Presidency , work began on the Constitutional Treaty , which was intended to strengthen European Union foreign policy , making it cohesive and visible in the international arena .
<2en> In spite of many complications related to reform of the EU treaties , today the Belgians have the opportunity of finalising their efforts and launching the European External Action Service - on the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009 .
<2en> We , as Members of a European Parliament strengthened by the Treaty , can help with this .
<2en> After many months of negotiations of the European Parliament delegation with Mrs Ashton , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , the EEAS is developing in the way advocated by Parliament .
<2en> The report by Mr Brok and Mr Verhofstadt is an important document which summarises all this work and is worthy of support .
<2en> What has Parliament managed to win in the negotiations with the High Representative ?
<2en> Firstly , a European Union diplomatic service , not an inter-governmental service , and this means an assurance that 60 % of posts will be appointed by the European Union .
<2en> Secondly , political and budgetary supervision of the EEAS by Parliament , which means the ability to interview candidates for the posts of heads of delegation and to inspect the finances of the institution , as we do for the Commission and the Council .
<2en> Thirdly , an equal distribution of posts in terms of nationality and gender , and also a review of the composition of the service in 2013 in order to correct any imbalances .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission as a whole , as do I , believes that our objective is to develop a social market economy .
<en> I can say , for me personally and for my portfolio , that in this expression , the ' social ' is more important than the ' market ' .
<en> Of course , at the end of the day , the Commission has to put forward , represent and implement a very balanced approach .
<en> However , I have always represented the social objectives and we have taken this very seriously .
<en> I also noted in the discussion that the forthcoming Single Market Act would be received with disappointment by Parliament if it were not to include a very strong social dimension .
<en> That is what we have been working on : ensuring that this very important document will be strong on social issues .
<en> I have participated in the relevant group of commissioners and have ensured the inclusion of items concerning pensions and other issues that are very important in terms of strengthening the social dimension of the European economy .
<en> However , there are many other issues .
<en> I would certainly object to an approach of having only one particular type of solution , i.e. establishing another high-level body in order to ensure that we deliver on social issues .
<en> There was nothing in my answer that suggests an objection to having a dynamic process on SSGI .
<en> In fact , we find ourselves in a dynamic process on SSGI in the run-up to the October conference of the Belgian Presidency .
<en> I will attend both the opening and the conclusions of that conference , and I am very hopeful that it will bring up a number of issues related to SSGI to guide us forward .
<en> SSGI is treated very seriously in the upcoming European Platform against Poverty which will be published at the end of the year .
<en> Mr Courard , the Secretary of State for Social Integration and the Fight Against Poverty , also referred to this in his introduction .
<en> I am open to taking further steps .
<en> However , I would first like to see what these events and documents will bring from the wider range of European stakeholders .
<en> I would like to stress that , although officially there is some recovery , we are in a very difficult phase of the economic crisis and that there is still a lot of pain inflicted not simply by the crisis itself but also by the measures to exit the crisis .
<en> The Commission has consistently been calling for the interests of social services and vulnerable groups to be taken into account .
<en> In recent weeks , I have made many speeches and I have called for caution in terms of the macro-economic policies of Member States .
<en> Fiscal consolidation is inevitable because countries accumulated high debts .
<en> However , austerity - especially mindless austerity - and single-minded expenditure cuts are not inevitable .
<en> All Member States , even those that are under pressure from the markets , have room to consider how to deliver a measured fiscal consolidation .
<en> Everyone has the capacity to balance the various options - expenditure cuts or revenue increases , and they can apply fairness ; they can take into account the interests of vulnerable groups .
<en> The Commission has been calling for that .
<en> Even in these difficult times , we are calling for social awareness .
<en> That is where the European Year has been helping us a lot .
<en> This has been an awareness-raising campaign and , to that extent , it has been a success because it helped to deliver the two very important targets of Europe 2020 .
<en> Without this campaign we would not have been successful in delivering the very ambitious targets on raising employment and reducing poverty in Europe .
<en> Of course , nobody believes that this can be delivered overnight .
<en> We have to improve our instruments .
<en> I accept what the honourable Member said about the European Social Fund ( ESF ) .
<en> It has not been functioning perfectly , but we are in the process of exploring where the ESF should be improved in terms of innovation , what the ESF should be dealing with , and how it should be used .
<en> This is all part of a process .
<en> There are series of conferences to discuss that , especially in the context of how to handle the situation of the Roma population , among other issues .
<en> The Belgian Presidency is holding a conference specifically on how the ESF could be more useful in reducing poverty .
<en> I would be doubtful about establishing a new fund .
<en> I think we first have to explore how the social fund could be used , with the available instruments , to improve social conditions .
<en> Here , I would underline the role of the European Investment Bank in terms of developing the infrastructure and services in Europe .
<en> Nobody is calling for the privatisation of social services .
<en> These are predominantly Member State competences .
<en> However , if the EU rules concerning public procurement or State aid , for example , are applied correctly , taking all important parameters into account , they will guarantee quality , cost effectiveness and transparency .
<en> These are very important objectives and we should not undermine these important objectives , particularly transparency , when we try to pursue other objectives , however important or relevant those might be .
<en> I hope these points are convincing and that the upcoming events , especially the next conference on SSGI and poverty , will provide ample opportunities to discuss how to proceed .
<en> I can assure you that reducing poverty and improving social standards in Europe are very much in the focus of the Commission 's work and very much in the focus of my personal agenda .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members for the quality of their speeches .
<2en> The Council has asked the Commission to develop a platform which is not limited to poverty , but which genuinely introduces a broader dynamic for dealing with the fight against exclusion and the role of social welfare .
<2en> I would also like to say that , in the austerity measures , which the Commissioner has just spoken about , it was obviously important to consider the measures to be taken in order to ensure that austerity does not make people even poorer .
<2en> The fight against poverty really must not be forgotten today .
<2en> I would also thank the Commission for its efforts in trying to establish greater legal certainty for social services of general interest ( SSGIs ) , and particularly in respect of their specific characteristics .
<2en> It is genuinely our wish to pursue discussions , in particular within the Social Protection Committee , as well as to improve dialogue with the various stakeholders , both institutional and non-institutional .
<2en> As Mr De Rossa stressed , it is clear that , in the debate on SSGIs , the involvement of the European Parliament is , and must remain , extensive .
<2en> Article 14 is also an important element which we must use in the discussions on SSGIs .
<2en> Indeed , it will be one of the important subjects to be discussed during the third forum on 26 and 27 October .
<2en> Finally , discussions on social affairs are difficult within the Council because of budgetary restrictions , as you know .
<2en> Nevertheless , social services fulfil necessary tasks - indispensable ones - which therefore require very specific attention , and , although their specific characteristics are recognised , this means that we must provide a specific way of dealing with them .
<2en> I will finish by thanking Commissioner Andor for his dynamism and his desire to make progress in everything relating to social affairs .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 149 )

<2en> The financial crisis has been contributing to a severe worsening of the European public 's social situation .
<2en> The recovery has been taking its time to be felt , with high rates of unemployment and weak economic growth .
<2en> The Europe 2020 strategy ( EU 2020 ) aims to set out a plan to facilitate the creation of economic growth that can offer higher employment and greater competitiveness within the Union .
<2en> Its defining initiatives constitute a path for us to follow towards making Europe more inclusive for Europeans .
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon reinforces Europe 's social policy dimension .
<2en> Europe belongs to the European public and part of its mission is to contribute to promoting employment , and to improving living and working conditions .
<2en> I would stress the crucial nature of dialogue between social partners , and the role of small and medium-sized enterprises as a driving force for the economy .
<2en> We must realise the Treaty of Lisbon 's objectives regarding social issues through the specific proposals included in EU 2020 , for example , defining initiatives such as ' an industrial policy for the globalisation era ' or ' an agenda for new skills and jobs ' .
<2en> Europe must be more competitive and able to face up to the challenges of globalisation without , however , refraining from being inclusive and aiming for development that is sustainable and which guarantees social integration .
<sp>
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon reconfirms Member States ' commitment to the basic social rights set out in the European Social Charter ( in 1961 ) and in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers ( in 1989 ) .
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon reaffirms that the European Union is working for Europe 's sustainable development .
<2en> The EU economy is a social market economy , promoting a large degree of competitiveness .
<2en> Its objectives include full employment , social progress and a high level of protection for and improvement in the quality of the environment .
<2en> The EU combats social exclusion and discrimination , and promotes justice and social protection , gender equality , solidarity between generations and the protection of children 's rights .
<2en> In August , the unemployment rate across the EU-27 was 9.6 % , with a rate of youth unemployment of 20 % .
<2en> The economic and financial crisis has had a dramatic impact on the social environment , with the main concern for European citizens nowadays being jobs and quality of life .
<2en> The European Union is primarily about its 500 million citizens , which is why Europe must have a social aspect .
<2en> Social Europe must offer European citizens jobs and a decent living , its young people high quality education and the prospect of integration into the labour market , and its pensioners a decent living and high quality healthcare services .

<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we should have listened to the advice of the Nobel laureate , Maurice Allais , who called for a clear separation between business banks , credit banks and speculative banks , in accordance with the principles of the Glass-Steagall Act , which is not discussed in this report .
<en> As far as the proposal to tax European taxpayers is concerned , my response is ' No tax in Europe ! '
<en> If this European Union proposal goes ahead , you can rest assured that we will have our own Tea Party here as well : there will be a mass protest .

<en> We are continuing to fund the banks .
<en> However , what are the banks doing in the midst of this economic and financial crisis ?

<en> They are still buying them .
<en> And what is the ECB doing while this is going on ?
<en> The ECB - set up to be an unchallengeable body - is letting it go on .

<en> Mr President , it is only two years since the financial crisis broke out and only six months since the Greek issue , and we are seeing all willingness fading away in our nation states .
<en> Today , we have a clear message from the European Parliament in the Berès report and the Feio report .
<en> We need more current economic and financial policies .
<en> We need more Europe , and a better Stability and Growth Pact with its mechanisms strengthened .
<en> The most recent decision by the ECOFIN Council is a slap in the face for European citizens .
<en> This is not adequate .
<en> We need to strengthen the strategy for growth , so that in this environment , it is sustainable and socially responsible , and we need better governance mechanisms for EU 2020 .
<en> We need more and better European economic governance for national actions to support this line , including the financial transaction tax that I urge the Commission to look at very carefully , including in a European context .
<en> We need a better and stronger united Europe speaking with one voice at global level .
<en> We need a better financial regulation and there is a long way still to go .
<en> To conclude , we need a Commission initiative .
<en> We need the Commission to act in the interests of European citizens , instead of a number of task forces .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Mr Chastel , Commissioner , this could actually have been a time of great answers , but in hindsight , it does not look like it .
<en> What is on the table for the so-called reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is no great answer ; once again , it is the lowest common denominator - the small morsel that could actually be agreed upon .
<en> I congratulate the Commission .
<en> You are still at the table - the Member States are not quite going it alone .
<en> I also congratulate the Council .
<en> Success has been achieved , France and Germany have an agreement - we do not know whether it is a good one or a bad one , but at least they are no longer stuck in the quagmire .
<en> What does all this mean ?
<en> It means that next year , if the growth figures collapse again , we will stand up in front of everyone and have no answer to the economic situation .
<en> Where is the section , the legal statute , in which you propose how we can together learn to drag ourselves out of the debt crisis ?
<en> That is where my group feels there is a gap and that is the debate that we are going to have in this House .
<en> Yes , we agree with those Members who want greater commitment to reform .
<en> That is something that we want too .
<en> However , we then need to discuss the substance .
<en> If you are not prepared to provide a more solid foundation for the actual orientation of our budgetary policy , then we can see no reason to continue discussing EU 2020 .
<en> It is already a paper tiger - we can throw it in the waste paper basket today if you will not debate the substance of it with us more forcefully .
<en> We want to make a difference .
<en> Yes , it makes a difference whether we invest in limping bureaucracy or in the energy sources and jobs of the future .
<en> Where is the point in your proposals where we can make this difference ?
<en> That is what we are waiting for .
<en> This debate has yet to take place .
<en> That will be the decisive thing for us .
<en> Moreover , we will not accept a catalogue of indicators that is based on the legislation .
<en> This Parliament will not have the wool pulled over its eyes .
<en> We want to debate whether employment and unemployment are an important feature of budgetary development or not , and we want to do so before the legislation is passed .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the current financial crisis offers the opportunity to make clear headway in the process of European integration .
<en> I want to focus my intervention on the creation of a European common treasury for the eurozone countries .
<en> This would be a clear improvement of the institutional framework for European economic governance .
<en> I know that this is a very delicate issue for some countries , but we will have to deal with it in the coming years .
<en> The European treasury would improve the coordination of the stimulus policies implemented by Member States .
<en> The European treasury would also be able to issue eurobonds to finance the construction of European infrastructures .
<en> The EU needs its own resources in the context of future diminishing budgets in the EU Member States .
<en> A European common treasury collecting some taxes at European level would allow the reduction of national transfers to the EU .
<en> Without real autonomy in income , there will not be real autonomy in expenditure .
<en> The creation of a European common treasury is a political decision .
<en> The sticking point in this discussion is the lack of political will or , to be more precise , the lack of political will on the part of Germany .
<en> In the 1990s , Germany had the political vision to push for the launching of the euro , despite the difficulties faced with its reunification process .
<en> In my opinion , Germany should lead now and move towards a common European treasury .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) If you have been listening to this debate here from early on , then I think that all those who say that the European Union is at a crossroads are correct .
<en> On one side , are those who advocate a strong Community approach .
<en> On the other side , it is fair to say , are a minority in this Parliament who think that the European Union should henceforth work more on an intergovernmental principle .
<en> The proposal to introduce various forms of European taxes also fits with this , even though it is called innovative financing .
<en> This echoes calls for the strengthening of the European Union , transferring more powers to the European Commission at the expense of the Member States .
<en> It is a shame that no one has yet said that the European Union and the European Commission should start reducing their programmes , reducing the number of its often controversial agencies and reforming the common agricultural policy .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The report with recommendations to the Commission on improving the economic governance and stability framework of the Union , in particular , in the euro area , that we have just voted on , is part of a wider debate , that has been going on for several months , on initiatives to combat the financial crisis .
<2en> A need is clearly emerging for strong economic governance of the European Union , especially after what happened in Greece a few months ago .
<2en> Any day now , we will see the final report by the European task force on economic governance , set up by the President of the European Council , Mr Van Rompuy .
<2en> Even now , however , we can state that there is an absolute need to identify rules for surveillance of economic policies , rules that are not mechanistic but realistic and sustainable , able to strengthen fiscal policy and improve European governance as a whole .
<sp>
<2en> One observation which could be made during the recent period of economic and financial crisis was that monitoring and economic coordination at EU level needed to be strengthened significantly .
<2en> Major macro-economic imbalances were noted and some states are faced with a major rise in public debt and its proportion of their GDP .
<2en> I voted for this report because I strongly support all eight recommendations made by the rapporteur with the intention of reflecting good governance and economic stability in the European Union .
<2en> I believe that we are going to face major challenges in the years to come .
<2en> We must be able to set definite priorities and make some difficult choices in order to support the EU 's economic growth potential and consolidate public finances .
<2en> EU-level coordination will be vital in this respect and may help eliminate the adverse effects .
<sp>
<2en> The joint debate on the European Council , the G20 , the report by the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis , and the report on European governance , have not produced clear guidelines or pertinent recommendations regarding the financial crisis .
<2en> Everyone had their say and gave their own personal interpretation of what are confused and woolly texts .
<2en> This is , unfortunately , the reality for these own-initiative reports , which bring large majorities together but , at the same time , do not say a lot .
<2en> The Feio report was discussed much too late in the day , the European Commission having already tabled the directives that will reform the Stability Pact and the governance of the euro area .
<2en> What is the point , in these conditions , in voting on recommendations to the Commission ?
<2en> Parliament should equip itself with far more stringent rules of procedure and abide by them .
<2en> Its effectiveness and credibility are at stake .
<2en> The reform of the Stability Pact and governance of the euro area will have its decisive moment when the legislative texts are analysed .
<2en> Along with colleagues , I will get down to this work , with an open mind and with diligence .
<2en> It is important that Parliament supports a realistic yet ambitious reform so as to build the monetary union on new foundations .
<2en> It is through painstaking work that an institution earns its legitimacy within the European structure , not by ...
<2en> ( The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<2en> Without rules or supervision , you cannot make any progress .
<2en> Applying the rules that we have imposed upon ourselves during this time of crisis , to improve coordination and surveillance in economic matters , is the least we must ask of ourselves and of the Member States .
<2en> In this vein , the report by Mr Feio allows us to focus on some considerable distortions , seeing how ' recent economic developments have shown clearly that economic policy coordination within the Union and , in particular , in the euro area , has not worked sufficiently well and that , despite their obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) , Member States have failed to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern ' .
<2en> My vote is therefore , without doubt , in favour of the report .
<sp>
<2en> The current financial and economic crisis has demonstrated that the EU needs increasingly strong economic and monetary governance so that the stability of the euro and the monetary union itself are not undermined .
<2en> Thus , the Europe 2020 strategy should seek to promote economic growth and create jobs , as the sharp fall in GDP , the drop in industrial production and the high numbers of unemployed are a major social and economic challenge which can only be overcome by strong , harmonious and united governance .
<2en> Mr Feio 's report points out ways and defines strategies towards a real strengthening of economic governance and the EU 's stability framework , with the main focus on the euro area .
<2en> Examples of this include the establishment of a coherent and transparent framework for surveillance , the strengthening of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) and the strengthening of economic governance in the euro area , among others .

<en> Mr President , a lot has been said about innovation over the last years .
<en> It has become a symbol of a policy instrument that can fix all our problems , so there are huge expectations and we must deliver .
<en> However , the time has now come for us to be more pragmatic .
<en> Without doubt , innovation can play a fundamental role in reinvigorating growth in the European economy , but for this to happen , we need a concrete , strong and joint public-private effort .
<en> This effort should aim to improve framework conditions and access to funding and to refocus innovation policy .
<en> But what matters most now is time , and we must move quickly and decisively from ambition to action by identifying and eliminating factors that still hinder innovation in Europe but , first and foremost , by designing effective new policy instruments .
<en> European innovation partnerships can be such an instrument , and a potentially excellent one .
<en> We should act urgently to put the first European innovation partnerships into action , and our approach should be ' learning by doing ' and using the good practice that exists in Europe .
<en> Today , innovation is usually born within a well functioning innovation system in which regions play a key role .
<en> This means that we can accelerate the move towards an innovation-based economy by fully exploiting the potential of current cohesion policy investment in innovation , which is EUR 85 billion , as well as its future post-2013 commitment to smart growth .
<en> Cohesion policy can make innovation work across all Member States and regions .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) Innovation policy and the realisation of technological achievements should become a decisive factor not only in implementing the EU 2020 strategy , but also for the future growth and competitiveness of the Union itself .
<en> The implementation of practically all European Union policy areas , such as increasing energy efficiency , establishing an economy that is less polluting , reducing the negative impact of climate change , and guaranteeing social welfare and job creation , is directly dependent on how effectively innovation policy is implemented .
<en> Europe needs an integrated innovation policy which will only be successful if effective coordinated cooperation can be ensured at regional , national and European level .
<en> I believe that the European Innovation Partnership is a major step towards a better coordinated innovation policy that would allow much better results to be achieved in the area of competitiveness , and would contribute to more rapid progress for the whole Community in the future .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at a time of squeezed public finances , investing in innovation could be Europe 's keystone to get out of the crisis .
<en> In the past , Europe has had a leading role in innovation .
<en> In fact , many innovations that have changed the world were launched on our continent , such as the mobile telephone .
<en> Europe 's great technological potential and human capital should be exploited to the full through strong coordination between the European Union and the Member States in order to avoid duplication and optimise investments .
<en> We need to adopt a more strategic and coordinated approach to innovation , for which the technological partnerships are a superb tool .
<en> I should like to ask the Council what actions it intends to take to make the partnerships more dynamic and how they can become launch pads for the real economy .
<sp>
<en> ( GA ) Mr President , we are undoubtedly facing a great challenge at present and we urgently need to look at new ways of solving all those problems .
<en> A few weeks ago , I had the privilege of chairing the launch here of the GE Innovation Barometer , within which there was a survey of various stakeholders .
<en> Two key points emerged : 90 % of respondents believe innovation is the main lever to a greater , more competitive and greener economy ; 83 % of respondents believe that public-private partnerships are essential to develop a more innovative Europe .
<en> Most people would agree with that , which is why we welcome this discussion .
<en> On this very day , I hosted a lunch involving Members of the Council , the Commission and MEPs on this very topic of Innovation Partnerships .
<en> As has been said , they are the key to the future if we want to meet our targets under the 2020 strategy - 3 % of GDP and , above all , venture capital , which is vital also .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) I wish to welcome the Commission 's proposal on launching the first European innovation partnership .
<en> To be able to get all Member States involved in innovation , the EU should take a more active role in directing the flow of investments required to combat the imbalances between Member States in terms of resources supporting infrastructure and management .
<en> I believe that particular attention must be focused on regional development projects .
<en> Innovation partnerships should focus on this objective as well .
<en> Attention must be paid to ensuring a high level of cohesion between EU Structural Funds , public finances in Member States and private contributions .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Parliament 's position as I believe that :
<2en> the present directive does not regulate alternative investment funds , which can continue to be regulated and monitored at a national level ;
<2en> it is necessary to ensure that the actions of alternative investment fund managers are subject to rigorous scrutiny in terms of governance ;
<2en> there should be an explicit obligation to establish and maintain policies and practices that are consistent with sound and effective risk management for categories of staff whose professional activities have a significant impact on the risk profile of alternative investment funds managed by them .
<2en> information and disclosure requirements and specific safeguards against asset stripping should be subject to a general exception for control over small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) ;
<2en> it is necessary to clarify the powers and duties of the competent authorities responsible for implementing this directive , and to strengthen the mechanisms needed to ensure effective cross-border cooperation in the field of monitoring .
<sp>
<2en> In Europe , alternative investment fund managers are responsible for managing a substantial volume of invested assets .
<2en> They represent a significant proportion of the trading on financial instrument markets and can exercise considerable influence on the markets and companies in which they invest .
<2en> I am certain that the impact of alternative investment fund managers on the markets in which they operate is significant , but the recent financial difficulties have highlighted the fact that the activities of investment fund managers can also contribute to extending and disseminating risks throughout the financial system and the economy .
<2en> The aim of this directive must also be to create incentives for transferring offshore funds to the Union , thus guaranteeing advantages in terms of the regulation and protection of investors while also setting the correct level of income for managers , funds and alternative investors .
<2en> I should like , in this session , to emphasise that uncoordinated national responses to such risks make it difficult to manage them effectively .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting against this report because it is content with regulating just the behaviour of alternative investment fund management companies , without touching on the nature or composition of the financial products in question .
<2en> This commitment to the ' creativity ' of the financial industry forgets the intrinsically destabilising and voracious scale of the speculation , of critical importance with this type of funds .
<2en> The proposed regulations are also extraordinarily weak .
<2en> They include so many exceptions and derogations at European level that they do not really break with the model of differential national regulation currently in force .
<2en> The report also fails to clearly separate those who work with this type of funds and those who work in traditional banking activities , or to block the actions of speculative funds located in tax havens .
<2en> Instead , by setting ' thresholds ' on the value of ' systemically relevant ' assets , it is clearing the way for formal fragmentation processes that will remove large numbers of the investment companies that are meant to be covered by the directive from its scope .
<2en> The security of the European public 's financial assets is a public good whose importance is too great for it to be exposed to the timidity of the proposed directive .
<sp>
<2en> The financial crisis has highlighted the need to subject the activities of the various players in financial markets to strict scrutiny , particularly bodies involved in the management and administration of alternative investment funds .
<2en> In actual fact , the impact of alternative investment fund managers on the markets in which they operate is largely beneficial , but the recent difficulties in the financial markets have demonstrated that their activities are vulnerable to a whole range of risks , and adequate management of these requires a coherent framework across the European Union .
<2en> Indeed , the establishment of a harmonised regulatory and monitoring framework at a Community level is proven to be suitable for the cross-border nature of the risks inherent in the activities of alternative investment fund managers , thus helping to strengthen the internal market .
<2en> I voted in favour of Parliament 's position for those reasons .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to congratulate Mr Gauzès for his excellent work .
<2en> The EU directive on hedge funds , private equity funds and other alternative investment funds , launched by the European Commission in April 2009 , in response to the financial crisis , and in accordance with guidelines agreed at the G20 summit , has finally been approved by a very wide majority .
<2en> It is a step forward for European ambition to have financial governance operational from the start of 2011 .
<2en> These new rules would make the international financial system more responsible and transparent and make it possible to limit speculation .
<2en> According to the directive , investors in speculative funds based in countries outside the EU ( hedge fund managers are often resident in tax havens ) will be forced to abide by the same conditions imposed on all European enterprises in order to operate within the EU market .
<2en> In order to obtain this ' European passport ' from the competent EU supervisory authorities , alternative fund managers will therefore have to accept clear rules , limits to speculation and greater transparency
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the resolution on the EU 's external strategy on Passenger Name Record data ( PNR data ) , since I believe that concluding agreements permitting the transfer of PNR data between the European Union and Canada , the United States and Australia is of paramount importance to international security .
<2en> I therefore welcome the Commission 's recommendation for negotiations to be opened with a view to concluding these agreements .
<2en> Indeed , it has been evident for several years now that exchanging these data helps in the fight against terrorism and international crime .
<2en> These international transfers of PNR data offer our countries ' law enforcement agencies precious means of combating the terrorist threat .
<2en> Furthermore , I must stress that the new global approach to PNR data presented by the Commission in October and aimed at establishing general criteria specific to all PNR agreements is very positive in my view .
<2en> It will create a more structured and more coherent framework for these agreements , and will provide significant guarantees in terms of the protection of personal data .
<sp>
<2en> This resolution completely contradicts the one adopted by this House in May .
<2en> It ' welcomes ' the proposal made by the Commission in September .
<2en> That proposal endorses the transfer of PNR data to third countries and contains no satisfactory guarantee as to the way in which the data will be used .
<2en> What is worse , it considers it justifiable to store these data for an unlimited period of time for profiling purposes .
<2en> What is the point of this resolution 's self-righteous railing against a practice that is at the heart of a project it supports ?
<2en> I voted against this resolution , which violates every human being 's right to have his or her personal data respected .
<sp>
<2en> Passenger Name Records ( PNR ) are another weapon in the fight against terrorism .
<2en> Under the Treaty of Lisbon , Parliament has to help set out a new external strategy regarding the negotiation of a new PNR agreement between the EU , the USA , Australia and Canada .
<2en> As a great advocate of the fight against terrorism , the EU is prepared to negotiate any agreement that may be effective in this fight .
<2en> The Union will not , however , endanger civil liberties and fundamental rights .
<sp>
<2en> I fully support the objective of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious transnational crime .
<2en> More and more countries are using passenger data for this purpose .
<2en> In the digital age , however , it is crucial to pay particular attention to the enforcement and protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights , including the right to privacy and data protection .
<2en> The key principles that must be prioritised in this area are necessity and proportionality .
<2en> The collection of passenger data must not just be useful ; it must be necessary too .
<2en> The principle of proportionality must also be invoked to prevent the planned measures from going above and beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives set .
<2en> There can be no question , therefore , of using the data for the purposes of exploitation or profiling .
<2en> Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Parliament has made a major contribution to the efforts to conclude these agreements , and therefore it must be fully and regularly informed of any developments relating to PNR data .
<sp>
<2en> In recent years , fundamental rights have increasingly been curtailed as part of the so-called war on terror .
<2en> The rationale behind this is extremely questionable .
<2en> While passengers are searched almost down to their underwear and are not allowed to carry nail files or deodorant in their luggage , checks on freight are often left to the shipping companies themselves .
<2en> If this is to change in future , it is important that the balance between freedom and security is preserved .
<2en> In the case of passenger security checks , this balance has already been lost and , therefore , as the hysteria surrounding terrorism subsides , the regulations will once again be relaxed .
<2en> Just as questionable is the issue of whether the FBI needs to know the name , address , e-mail address , credit card number and number of suitcases of people travelling to the USA and whether it should be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years .
<2en> The information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional cases .
<2en> If fundamental rights are infringed in order to create a sense of security , the infringement must be as limited as possible and the rights of those affected must be reinforced .
<2en> Unfortunately , this is unlikely to happen at the moment and , therefore , I have voted against the motion .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , as many of you know already , Lithuania will take over the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) in January 2011 .
<2en> This chairmanship could be a unique opportunity for my country to take initiatives to strengthen regional cooperation , increase energy security and combat corruption .
<2en> It is also important not to underestimate the human dimension of OSCE cooperation .
<2en> As well as its political and military dimension , the OSCE also plays a crucial role in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
<2en> The EU must also play an important role in this field .
<2en> The coordination of EU and OSCE activities in the field of human rights is a common interest we all share .
<2en> Let us not forget the circumstances in which the OSCE was established .
<2en> This year marks the 35th anniversary of the inaugural conference of the OSCE and the Helsinki Final Act , when the foundations of this organisation were laid .
<2en> This event symbolised a moral and political commitment to the principles of democracy and human rights .
<2en> It is regrettable that this spirit of Helsinki has dimmed in recent years .
<2en> This must change .
<2en> I therefore await the results of the OSCE summit this December in Astana with much impatience .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of this report because the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) has lost a great deal of its influence over the last ten years .
<2en> In the motion for a resolution , the European Parliament praises the activities of the OSCE in the past and calls on the Member States , the Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to come up with proposals as to how the Union can effectively become involved in the OSCE and can contribute constructively to achieving the shared objectives .
<2en> Anyone who wants to avoid military intervention in crises must take preventative political measures in good time .
<sp>
<2en> History teaches us that armed conflicts are an outcome of the inability of the combatants to talk about contentious issues and find compromise solutions .
<2en> The OSCE represents a forum for seeking such solutions .
<2en> At the same time , the OSCE is today respected as an independent arbiter in assessing the democratic running of elections , and democratic standards .
<2en> I am therefore in favour of strengthening the OSCE , particularly in relation to the spreading of democracy and compliance with human rights .
<2en> The OSCE monitoring and field missions are an important part of the expansion of the free world .
<2en> However , from an EU perspective , some activities are being duplicated here .
<2en> If we are talking about strengthening the OSCE , we should , at the same time , think about the extent to which the OSCE can replace the activities of EU representatives in various conflict regions .
<2en> Also , as we are praising the work of the OSCE in the area of human rights , this opens up the possibility of discussing the extent to which the roles of the OSCE and the Council of Europe overlap .
<2en> The aim of this discussion should be to achieve higher efficiency in the spending of public funds , which , in a time of cost cutting , is undoubtedly a priority for our voters .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations because , under the current circumstances of the unprecedented demographic problems posed by increased life expectancy and falling birth rates , they constitute one of the most urgent social policy challenges of coming years .
<2en> Decisions need to be taken urgently , especially at a time when the availability of jobs for young people and the sustainability of pension systems for older people are at risk .
<2en> Solidarity between generations is needed to enable the contributions of both generations to be optimised .
<2en> The only way that this will be possible is by guaranteeing free and equal access to jobs , lifelong training and career progression for all ages .
<2en> That will be possible , firstly , through ensuring that young people are guaranteed jobs and , secondly , through making good use of the contribution that older people can still make to society , notably in terms of voluntary work and of their continuing to work beyond the established retirement age .
<sp>
<2en> While emphasising that a society which respects human dignity is based on the principle of justice between the generations , I believe that this report is important in terms of combating prejudices and discrimination in every form and against every group in society as well .
<2en> I maintain that the migration of citizens , their successful integration , including into economic life , and their social inclusion , can provide a means of tackling demographic change .
<2en> For these reasons , I agree that an open debate is required to discuss various immigration policies .
<2en> Eradicating prejudice about different cultural models is a prerequisite for the successful integration of immigrants , which also complements solidarity between the generations and cultures .
<2en> The report also proposes adopting new provisions against age discrimination with regard to accessing goods and services .
<2en> This is why I voted for Thomas Mann 's report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> In recent years , EU Member States , faced with a dramatic decline in the birth rate , have had to cope with an increasingly ageing population .
<2en> The rise in life expectancy is a positive development , keeping people physically and mentally active for longer .
<2en> In these circumstances , it is becoming clear that we need to face the prospect of the situation becoming even more serious , resulting in a demographic imbalance which will have its impact on Member States ' economies and budget resources , a development which has repercussions as well for the EU as a whole .
<2en> Therefore , we are facing the possibility of future generations bearing the financial burden for these demographic changes .
<2en> This situation makes the Lisbon objective of having half the population aged between 55 and 64 in employment absolutely essential , even if it has been missed this year .
<2en> To counter this phenomenon , swift and decisive measures must be taken , in a lifecycle-orientated approach , to bring young and older people into the labour market .
<2en> The proportion of people out of work in the 15-24 age group is considerably higher than that for any other age group in the EU .
<2en> Therefore , the proposal for the European Youth Guarantee initiative should be recommended .
<sp>
<2en> First of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Mann on the drafting of this report , which has the merit of proposing specific measures for establishing a worthwhile dialogue between generations .
<2en> I voted in favour because I believe that establishing a fair balance between generations is the only way for the younger generation to be given real assurances and to increase their participation in the labour market .
<2en> I also believe the time has come for the European Union and the Member States to examine the new questions posed by the generational challenge .
<2en> Europe will soon , in fact , be facing real problems due to its low demographic growth , and suitable policies need to be adopted straight away so as not to jeopardise the entire European social security system .
<2en> In this respect , I think it is essential to re-evaluate social policy in favour of the over-sixties .
<2en> People in this age group bring added value to the world of work , and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more .
<2en> I therefore agree with the proposal to review the social security system so as to allow the over-sixties to keep their jobs after they have reached retirement age .
<sp>
<2en> In my opinion , the rapporteur quite correctly proposes two measures relating to the effects of the unevenness of demographic development on the financing of social expenditure and the financial situation of pension systems in all Member States .
<2en> The first measure aims to increase employment among young people , and the second to put back the retirement age .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur 's view that older people are not a burden for the economy and society but , on the contrary , a great benefit because of their experience of life and their knowledge .
<2en> I have decided to vote in favour of the report , because the controversial section which supported the idea of replacing the current continuous system with a system based on capital funds has been taken out of the report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the report .
<2en> It addresses the demographic problem and solidarity between the generations in a very conservative manner .
<2en> In numerous instances , such as the almost unlimited extension of working life , it blows the workers ' labour and insurance rights sky high and will exhaust them completely .
<2en> The problem of youth unemployment is growing .
<2en> Improvements to life expectancy and living standards are becoming a problem , rather than a pan-human - and , hence , pan-European - objective .
<sp>
<2en> We are today faced with a high rate of youth unemployment and underfinanced pension schemes .
<2en> We must find a joint solution , since youth must be considered a precious and essential resource that must be mobilised in the pursuit of social and economic objectives , particularly in an ageing society .
<2en> If we do not manage to reverse the current trend , it is estimated that by 2030 , demographic change will result in a two-to-one ratio between the active and inactive populations .
<2en> Although the main instruments for promoting justice between generations fall under the jurisdiction of the Member States , the EU plays a crucial role in terms of surveillance , monitoring the correct and effective implementation of Union anti-discrimination legislation , and in terms of promoting the exchange of best practices and action plans .
<2en> It is essential for the EU and the Member States to promote new initiatives for active , healthy and dignified ageing .
<2en> It is also necessary to establish long-term prospects for young people , and to take measures to encourage mobility during their studies , ensure high quality vocational training and create new jobs , thus securing their full participation in society .

<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to congratulate our fellow Members , Mrs Bilbao , and Messrs Gallagher , Gróbarczyk and Ferreira , on their reports .
<en> I would like to say how pleased I am to see Parliament conclude its first reading on the two long-term plans for anchovies and horse mackerel .
<en> In fact , with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon , Parliament has become a joint decision maker on these matters .
<en> With regard to the anchovy stock , I am delighted by the text adopted in the Committee on Fisheries , which is aimed at long-term management of a much fished species .
<en> This plan will allow for joint management measures between the main fishing countries .
<en> Live bait will be taken into consideration in the quotas , making it possible to check the quantities fished in the fairest way .
<en> Moreover , I welcome the measures for supervising control of this fishery .
<en> The system for controlling vessels absolutely must be the same in the various Member States exploiting this stock .
<en> I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher on his report .
<en> I know we shall adopt it tomorrow : it makes the socio-economically and environmentally sustainable exploitation of the mackerel stock possible .
<en> This plan comes up with a new decision-making method concerning the total allowable catch that will make it possible to ensure the sustainability of the stock in the long term .
<en> I would also like to remind you of the importance of the principle of relative stability , which is particularly close to my heart .
<en> The rapporteurs stress the need to tackle discards , and this can only be welcomed .
<en> However , like my fellow Members , I find it regrettable that the Council is challenging Parliament 's new joint decision-making power concerning the long-term management plans .
<en> I think that this issue of a legal basis needs to be resolved as it is delaying implementation of the plans , which is essential for conserving the resource and regulating fishing .
<en> We must also define , once and for all , the notions of non-industrial fishing and industrial fishing .
<en> This will ensure that the reform of the common fisheries policy is undertaken on a sound and firm footing .
<en> This is also what is suggested in the report by Mr Gróbarczyk , whom I thank for the quality of his work .
<en> Moreover , a total ban on discards is not realistic , as we know .
<en> I hope that the European Commission will support the sector , which is introducing selective gear and ensuring economically and environmentally sustainable fishing .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one minute is not long enough to cover four reports .
<en> I therefore congratulate the three other rapporteurs , but I will only comment on Mr Ferreira 's report .
<en> Adherence to the principles of biodiversity must be central to the actions which the European Union undertakes with regard to fishing and aquaculture .
<en> The compromise amendment is the result of the good work carried out by Mr Ferreira , who has clearly understood these concerns .
<en> We must not have preconceived ideas when looking for ways to improve fish farming standards , but we must be rigorous in the control and application of regulations which are as precise as possible , in order to avoid the risk of altering the environmental balance .
<en> In this way , the greatest support for organic production is a decision which is made in the general interest and which encompasses the protection of biodiversity .
<en> That , in fact , is the best way of optimising the production of native species .
<en> Commissioner , I hope that , as part of the common fisheries policy reform , this further measure with regard to aquaculture can be included in one simplified regulation .
<en> This will simplify matters greatly , and I hope that a single regulation on aquaculture will make the procedures as a whole even simpler .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Gróbarczyk for his help .
<en> I am very pleased that it was possible to include a very significant point in the report , calling on the Commission to prepare a comprehensive management plan for flounder in the waters of the Baltic Sea .
<en> I would like to take the opportunity to bring to the Commissioner 's attention the fact that the Polish authorities have been proposing the adoption of a comprehensive management system for flatfish stocks in the Baltic for many years , and have not obtained any tangible results from the European Commission .
<en> A uniform system for the management of flatfish , wherever they may be located , must be drawn up .
<en> They have great economic importance for Baltic fishermen , including those from Poland , which is why they merit greater attention from European institutions responsible for fisheries than they have enjoyed so far .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their reports and , in particular , Mr Gallagher .
<en> Two things jump out at me immediately in hearing the discussion that has gone on .
<en> The first thing is that the whole concept of creating an opportunity to allow for a split within the TACs in one fishery is irresponsible to the extreme .
<en> We should strongly oppose that .
<en> Secondly , with regard to the issue of discards , maybe now is the time to look at creating a grey market for those discards .
<en> They are by-catches to normal fishery operations and instead of them being thrown back into the water , why not allow them to be landed and pay for the cost of catch - not a market price , but the cost of catch .
<en> This can be used as a replacement for the thousands of tonnes of imported fish , coming from the Far East and other places , to fill other markets within the European Union .
<en> This can be a win-win situation .
<en> It can reduce the amount of discards and also ensure that fishermen are not throwing back a valuable product .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks , but before there is too much self-congratulation on these proposals , we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures .
<en> Britain 's home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies .
<en> The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists , not EU bureaucrats .
<en> The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain 's fishing fleets is simple : scrap quota systems , which lead to discards and high grading , and replace them with weight-based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed .
<en> We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers , supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen 's livelihoods .
<en> Quotas of all kinds - and in whichever seas - should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal , family and community connections .

<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take a few seconds to express my disapproval of the Council 's decision to reject the report by Mrs Estrela on maternity leave .
<en> Today , I am acting as the spokesperson for millions of European mothers and fathers who , like me , are very disappointed by the Council 's decision .
<en> It is an admission of a lack of values , which I do not identify with and which I condemn with every fibre of my being .
<en> I wonder what kind of Europe we are heading towards .
<en> Rejecting this proposal is a decision that hurts not just the families of today but , above all , the families of tomorrow .
<sp>
<en> We shall now proceed to the vote .
<en> ( For the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mr Chastel , Mr Barnier , after the comments that you have heard , you can draw two conclusions .
<2en> The first is that Parliament will overwhelmingly support this report tomorrow , which will show once again that Parliament , or a large majority of it , appreciates the actions on regulation and supervision that are being taken by the Commission and which have been strongly supported by the Belgian Presidency .
<2en> The second conclusion that we can draw is that I will not come to a conclusion today , but that a new debate will open up , on the basis of this consultation , of Mr Klinz 's own-initiative report , to examine all these difficult questions .
<2en> Thus , we cannot avoid the fact that in 2009 , when we brought about the first regulation , we were already asking ourselves these questions .
<2en> If we have not dealt with these questions , it is because we have not found an appropriate response .
<2en> I hope , therefore , that , thanks to the thought that is being given to the matter with the submission of Mr Klinz 's report , the discussion about consultation which is taking place will this time enable us to provide responses to complete the regulation on rating agencies .
<2en> In conclusion , however , if you will allow me , I will repeat a phrase by the President of the Securities and Markets Authority , who said that , at the very least , it would be good if the financial markets detoxified themselves of the rating agencies to allow investors to gain a greater personal appreciation of situations and risks .
<2en> I think that that would also be a guarantee .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow ( Wednesday , 15 December 2010 ) .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 149 )
<sp>
<2en> As a result of underestimating the credit risk , credit rating agencies were one of the factors that triggered the global financial crisis .
<2en> On the other hand , there is no real competition in the credit rating agency sector .
<2en> This situation increases the danger of conflicts of interest and , by extension , of a lack of transparency and quality in terms of awarding ratings to the various financial instruments .
<2en> On 1 January 2011 , the regulation giving rise to the creation of the European Securities and Markets Authority will come into force .
<2en> Its main power will be to supervise agencies of this kind .
<2en> Introducing a mechanism for monitoring and supervising credit rating agencies at EU level is proving to be a necessity .
<2en> I think that this new authority needs to exercise its mandate as soon as it is created .
<2en> I would like to point out that the decision made by the United States to introduce tighter supervisory regulations has paved the way for global harmonisation .
<sp>
<2en> The European Union has already implemented rules , which will come into force at the end of the year .
<2en> The rules for credit rating agencies that wish to operate in the EU and thus obtain a licence include , among other things , the obligation to register themselves and to comply with specific transparency and ' good behaviour ' rules .
<2en> I do not believe that these rules are strict enough , and I welcome the further measure that we are discussing within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
<2en> These agencies currently have a great deal of power ; they can plunge a State and / or even a system ( downgrading countries and causing a chain reaction of fear on the world markets ) into crisis with one of their ratings .
<2en> Their work is important in terms of guaranteeing reliability and stability , but there are doubts as to the rules and the criteria on which their ratings are based .
<2en> Mr Gauzès 's report , which proposes bringing credit rating agencies under the supervision of the European Securities and Markets Authority , is therefore along the right lines .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Madam President , Ireland has been mentioned many times in this debate .
<en> I would like to start by making it clear that I support deeper economic governance in a European social market economy .
<en> We should thank Ireland 's partners in Europe for their solidarity at this time of crisis - a crisis created largely by incompetent Conservative governments over many years .
<en> You will not be surprised that solidarity is being presented by Eurosceptics as a loss of Ireland 's independence .
<en> That distortion is heightened by the failure of the Commission and the Council to engage with this Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding with Ireland .
<en> When , Mr Rehn , will that Memorandum of Understanding be brought before this Parliament ?
<en> Commissioner Rehn , one of the meanest conditions and obligations in the Memorandum of Understanding is the obligation to cut the minimum wage in Ireland by EUR 2 000 per year .
<en> The Irish Government is claiming that you demanded that cut , Mr Rehn .
<en> Can you clarify that matter for this House ?
<en> A second incomprehensible aspect of this agreement is the 3 % margin which you have demanded ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Madam President , it is not acceptable that essential measures should continue to be put off , measures that disregard the increase in unemployment , poverty , inequality , disparity and economic recession that these austerity plans will cause , while economic and financial groups continue to make ever larger profits .
<en> This just leads to more questions :
<en> Why have the statutes and the guidelines of the European Central Bank not been changed with regard to their loans made directly to Member States at a rate of 1 % , the same as for private banks , who then charge rates three , four or five times higher , thus aggravating sovereign debt ?
<en> Why has it not been decided to apply a tax on movements of capital , and not take the necessary measures to put an end to tax havens and derivative markets , ending speculation on sovereign debt ?
<en> Why not decide to increase the community budget for a real policy of economic and social cohesion that aims to increase production and create jobs with rights ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) Madam President , we are debating a proposed financial stability instrument for the eurozone - an instrument which should help our friends from countries which are currently unable to pay their debts .
<en> Everyone here is talking about creating a common financial stability mechanism guaranteed by all eurozone countries , and we expect those who have managed to keep their debts under control to show solidarity with those who have not yet managed to do that .
<en> After experiencing the solutions to date for assisting Greece and the one-off protective bulwark erected last time , I wonder what would happen if the financial wizards from the markets picked up their calculators and began working out the actual worth of the solution and discovered that not even this was reliable enough to make them willing to risk investing their money in the area ?
<en> I wonder if we have any subsequent solutions and subsequent steps prepared ?
<en> The credibility of the solution at this point in time , according to this scenario , is very low .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , most ordinary people see crises as tragedies .
<en> Eurocrats see them as opportunities to extend their tentacles of power .
<en> The European Council is to decide on a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole , backed up of course by treaty amendments .
<en> We are reliably informed that these controls , and of course these treaty changes , will apply to non-eurozone countries too .
<en> The coalition government in the United Kingdom has promised a referendum in the event of any further transfer of power to the European Union .
<en> However , this promise will be as reliable and as honestly followed as the Conservative pledge to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> For Conservatives , promises are tactics , not obligations .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , the end of the year is approaching .
<en> It would be a good idea to take a closer look at what we have done .
<en> Let us look at what we have decided and what we have said , and let us answer this question : what have we done about it ?
<en> Each of us should look carefully at our own decisions in areas where we have had responsibility .
<en> It is good that we want to add to the Treaty certain provisions which will impose discipline on what we do .
<en> However , we do still have , after all , the Stability and Growth Pact , which continues to be in force .
<en> Why did we not adhere to its provisions ?
<en> Why did the Commission and its services not react earlier in the case of Greece or Ireland ?
<en> The European Union is a democratic institution which comprises many Member States .
<en> It is not , therefore , able to act unilaterally in the way that individual states do - I am thinking , here , for example , of China , the United States and other countries .
<en> This is why there was a lack of decisive action to protect the euro .
<en> Therefore , it is necessary to develop a new approach to economic governance , to create a true economic union , to improve coordination and to harmonise financial and even fiscal policy .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are talking about the summit on 16 December .
<en> It would be good if the Council could say to us after the summit : We are aware of the gaps and the mistakes , we know where we have failed and we understand the limits of the treaty .
<en> Self-satisfaction and accusations of guilt , attempts to gloss over mistakes and a superficial approach will not solve any problems or create any confidence .
<en> Let us stop playing with Europe .
<en> This really is all about Europe .
<en> I endorse everything that Mr Klinz has said .
<en> As it is now only a few days before Christmas , I would like to say : Light a candle of determination and common interest , a candle representing the new seriousness , honesty and confidence in the future of the Europe Union .
<en> Light a candle for a change of political course in Europe , a move from the crisis to competitiveness , from the spirit of Deauville to the political union , from saving to investment and reform , from the monetary union to the political union .
<en> Because of Germany 's constitutional problems , the addition to the treaty is simply a political crutch for the further development of the rescue package , nothing more and nothing less .
<en> It does not represent a solution .
<en> Do not try to make it more important than it really is .
<en> Stop the day-by-day policymaking and put forward a complete concept in response to the crisis which will move us towards political union .
<en> Put an end to the discord .
<en> It is enough , it is not enough and , actually , we do not know where things are going .
<en> We must call on the Commission to produce a concept for an economic , social and financial union , so that we can take the next step towards integration at the end of next year and really do the job properly .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , tomorrow sees the start of one of the most crucial European Councils in the history of the European Union as a whole and EMU in particular and the question is whether the Heads of State or Government will be up to the job .
<en> We very much doubt it , because the philosophy that certain heads have introduced into the European Council is not a philosophy of overcoming the crisis on the basis of solidarity and , of course , responsibility .
<en> It is a crisis management philosophy , a philosophy that focuses on and is confined to the details of a permanent mechanism .
<en> The European Council will not be up to the job , because it will not send out the message of economic and political cohesion that needs to be sent out , not only to convince the markets , but to convince , first and foremost , the entrenched European public , who are viewing each other with suspicion and who have again started to become xenophobic ; to convince them of the value of the European vision and to remind them that there are more things that unite than divide us .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I cannot understand why the Socialists are trying to escape from the responsibility of Socialist policies .
<en> It is true that the reasons for the deficits we see in Europe are different .
<en> It is also true that Socialist governments have entered into budget deficit problems because of a deliberate policy of increased spending and increased deficits .
<en> We had this debate in Parliament in the spring of 2009 and we had it in a number of Member States .
<en> I remember the Swedish Social Democrats criticised the Swedish Government for not increasing the deficit and the spending .
<en> Then we have seen what has happened .
<en> This is for me a reason why we need stable rules regarding the Stability and Growth Pact but also stable rules regarding the consequences .
<en> We cannot have a situation where Member States which are causing problems for financial systems and causing increased interest rates are allowed to escape from the consequences by letting other citizens pay for those interest rates .
<en> We need to have stability , and eurobonds will not be a solution to that problem .
<en> We can have eurobonds for other reasons. maybe .
<en> As for the financial mechanism , it must be financed and based upon the risks that Member States are creating .
<en> If you take a bigger risk , run a bigger deficit , then you also need to finance the financial mechanism a little bit more .
<en> That is a way of taking responsibility for deliberate policies .
<en> Do not forget that the consequences we see in a number of countries are the consequences of the debates we had in national parliaments , and in this Parliament , when some of us argued for increased spending .
<en> Now we see the bitter results .
<en> ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , I can understand , Mr Hökmark , that you need to give a nice speech for the people at home in Sweden .
<en> However , would you please answer the following question for me : Which country in the European Union has the highest long-term level of national debt and which party is in government in this country ?
<sp>
<en> ( Mr Schulz continued speaking , with his microphone turned off ) Madam President , I hope I can proceed without further interventions .
<en> First of all my message is very much to you , Mr Schulz , because I want you to remember what you argued here in this Parliament two years ago .
<en> You argued that the Union and the Member States should increase their spending .
<en> The problem is that some of the Member States have had Socialist governments , and in all these governments , in all these countries , we have seen the deficit going up a result of the policies you advocated .
<en> Mr Schulz , can you deny that ?
<en> ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for a number of years , many families in Italy and just as many Romanian children have been suffering the consequences of Romania 's block on international adoptions .
<en> The Hague Convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the European Union , and Romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it .
<en> If Romania believes that the block on international adoptions works to protect children - for example , from the risk that a market for the illegal trafficking of children would be created - it must also deal with this problem with the help of the European Union , by toughening up controls and introducing strict regulations .
<en> However , we need to make an effort to ensure that many respectable families can adopt children , who deserve a second chance for a happy childhood .
<en> I would therefore ask the Commission how it intends to support a possible commitment from Romania to remove the moratorium on international adoptions and , furthermore , I should like to know the Commission 's position on the possibility of creating a European adoption agency , including in the light of the studies carried out .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , adoption can , and often does , work for the good of the child , but the procedures related to adoption can also give rise to abuses , such as the trafficking of children and taking children for adoption from families which have not abandoned their children at all , but which often , because of poverty , are not able to give their children the right environment .
<en> The high number of children in orphanages , which we are talking about in today 's debate , often does not mean children who have been abandoned , but in fact represents children of poor parents who are not coping with their difficult personal situation .
<en> Such families should be helped .
<en> State authorities could help these families for far lower sums without placing the children in an orphanage at all and without then giving them up for adoption .
<en> We should adopt an unequivocal principle - it should be obligatory in the European Union - never take children from their families because of poverty .
<en> Give help , and do not take children from their families .
<en> Poverty must not be the reason for depriving a child of its biological family .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today , we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union , which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs .
<en> This contradiction reveals some people 's genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested .
<en> The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union .
<en> The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption .
<en> On the one hand , this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature .
<en> However , on the other hand , the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes .
<en> The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and , naturally , the political approach is changing .
<en> The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union .
<en> This is the basis of today 's debate and the oral question submitted , which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament , and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown .
<en> Allow me to recall Antoine de Saint-Exupéry , who said : ' All grown-ups were children once - although few of them remember it ' .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , the oral question which has provided the basis for the resolution on international adoptions places an item of paramount importance on the European Parliament 's agenda .
<en> International adoption can only be considered as an alternative after all the measures for arranging a national adoption have been exhausted .
<en> International adoption also raises a series of specific issues and difficulties , largely arising from the limited interaction between a child and adoptive parents in the period prior to adoption , as well as from problems encountered by the child after adoption relating to linguistic and cultural adjustment .
<en> The principle of acting in the best interests of the child and not the adopter , as stipulated in the UN and Hague Conventions , must form the basis of the European Parliament 's resolution , with the focus on the child 's development in a family environment which ensures continuity in the child 's upbringing , taking into account the child 's ethnic , religious , cultural and linguistic background .
<en> The key consideration when examining the subject of adoptions and drafting the resolution is the principle of reintegrating the child from the protection system into a biological or extended family .
<en> I would like to highlight a confusion which is often made between the number of children who have been separated from their parents , but are in the care of the protection system , and the number of children available for adoption .
<en> Children separated from their parents enjoy protection from the state for a limited period of time and are not available for adoption .
<en> I think that we do not need control mechanisms and that the existing principles applied internationally which are linked to them are adequate .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this evening , we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic , which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli , and which we have turned into this oral question .
<en> From a dialectical point of view , they have presented us with a very simple problem , or so it would seem .
<en> There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children .
<en> However , these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless .
<en> Clearly , these children are our priority .
<en> They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires .
<en> However , when these children remain in care for too long , they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders .
<en> All this is happening whilst , meanwhile , many families would like to open their homes to these children .
<en> I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt .
<en> However , we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions , as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children , obviously .
<en> We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children , because in a few years ' time , these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the greatest gift that we can give to any child is that of a happy home .
<en> Most children find that in their own home with their natural parents .
<en> Many though , get this with their adoptive parents .
<en> Either is preferable to an institutional life , provided , of course , that there is no corruption or exploitation involved .
<en> To find the balance is very difficult , but I think that we need - while taking into consideration the Hague Convention , etc . - where there are prospective adoptive parents who are bona fide and beyond reproach , to facilitate them more in giving the gift of a happy home to a child who has not otherwise got one , and not encumbering them with lengthy , expensive , drawn-out processes .
<en> We need to get the balance right because , as a teacher , I came across many adopted children and the vast majority were in very good homes .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Angelilli , ladies and gentlemen , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the protection and care of children has become one of the fundamental rights that Europe is legally bound to protect .
<en> Even so , there are still too many cases in Europe of children being abandoned who , in the best scenario , end up in orphanages .
<en> This is a tragic situation which our democracies cannot tolerate .
<en> This is why we need to make all the efforts required to prevent this situation from becoming unmanageable , adopting a strategy to raise the level of awareness and favouring the right to adopt children at international level as much as possible .
<en> To make this happen , we first of all need an accurate picture of the situation in all the Member States , with constant monitoring which could also be carried out by creating a permanent observatory on children 's rights .
<en> In addition , we need a comprehensive overview of the existing measures taken by the European Union and those that could be developed to protect children in need of adoption by European citizens as much as possible .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the wide range of instruments which currently govern international adoptions has led to confusion over whose role it is to safeguard the rights of children subject to international adoptions .
<en> The Commission needs to focus further on the competent authorities , and ensure that those regulating the adopters ' and the adopted children 's rights are making sure that basic minimum standards are adhered to , and that , in the longer term , the child is able to maintain a link to its birth country and its culture .
<en> Specifically , urgent measures must be taken to react to the abuse and trafficking of children , which , as a report in my own country today shows , is alarmingly on the rise both within and across European borders .
<en> Child trafficking and child laundering - the stealing of children who are subsequently sold to adoptive parents as legitimate orphans - is a phenomenon which does not receive adequate attention at an international level .
<en> I would call on the Commission to play a more active role in the field of international adoption , to take concrete steps to improve the convoluted and confused legislative framework which currently governs international adoption in the EU , and to protect those most vulnerable young people .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Mr President , we are talking at this moment about international adoptions because there are children in every country who , for various reasons , cannot be placed in functioning families or in replacement families in the same country .
<en> It is not acceptable to have a repeat of the situation we witnessed in the recent past when a more affluent country such as Italy enjoyed greater opportunities to adopt children from the less affluent Romania .
<en> Surely , as a number of Members have already said this evening , poverty cannot be a sufficient reason for taking a child away from the family and allowing an international adoption .
<en> I would like to emphasise strongly that we must take great care in this situation to uphold not only national laws but also international laws , in order to prevent the risk of abuse , trafficking and the abduction of children .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , I , too , would like to refer to the UN Convention , which states that international adoptions can only offer an alternative means of supporting the child when the child cannot be placed in an adoptive family or cannot be cared for in a suitable manner in his or her country of origin .
<en> The liberalisation of international adoption entails numerous risks .
<en> On the one hand , it increases the possibility of child trafficking and abuse caused as a result of financial interests and difficulties in monitoring the situation after adoption takes place .
<en> On the other hand , separating children from their biological parents and place of origin can have adverse psychological , social and educational repercussions .
<en> When we discuss adoption , our main consideration must be to safeguard the child 's welfare .
<en> Therefore , pressure must not be exerted on EU Member States with diverse traditions and legal procedures relating to adoption to liberalise international adoption .

<en> Prime Minister , thanks to you , over the last half year , we have developed new ways of cooperating at different levels between the two chambers of legislation of the European Union : between Council and the European Parliament .

<sp>
<2en> 31 December 2010 saw the end of a rather dull Presidency , which some people have described as lacklustre and weak .
<2en> That was all we could have expected from a Belgian Government that has not actually existed for eight months .
<2en> Belgian politics has not managed to set out a political plan for its own country , which is the victim of an unprecedented institutional crisis .
<2en> I do not see how it could possibly have led such a complex entity as the European Union - itself very fragile and rickety today - with foresight and vision for the future .
<2en> The Belgian Presidency was supposed to put Europe on the road to recovery from the economic and financial crisis .
<2en> Yet , once again , we find ourselves tackling the speculation that threatens the very existence of the single currency , even today .
<2en> It was the Belgian Presidency that was behind the major acceleration in the further enlargement of the EU 's borders .
<2en> As we have seen in recent years , the accession of economically weak countries has complicated the work of the European institutions and weakened the whole of Europe , which is now less capable than it was previously of shouldering the domestic problems of any new Member States .
<sp>
<2en> Belgium occupied the Presidency of the European Union for the last six months and hardly anyone there seems to have noticed .
<2en> The country was mainly preoccupied - and what is more , unsuccessfully so - with forming a new government , while the quarrelling between the Flemings and the Walloons has rendered the country unable to make political decisions .
<2en> It was therefore little wonder that the EU political establishment had an easy ride in its desire to push forward centralisation within the European Union .
<2en> The euro crisis was used as a pretext to forge plans for European economic governance .
<2en> Meanwhile , the so-called ' permanent rescue package ' for the euro is nothing other than an assault on the net contributors , who will have to dig even deeper into their pockets in future .
<2en> Belgium should actually be regarded as a cautionary example of what can happen if peoples with differing economic performances are corseted up together .
<2en> Belgium , where the differences between the Flemings and the Walloons are evidently irreconcilable , and where the Federal apparatus represents a redistribution mechanism from the Flemings to the Walloons , shows what may befall the European Union and the euro area if they continue to follow the existing misguided path .
<sp>
<2en> In summing up the Belgian Presidency , we should , first of all , appreciate its highly active role in designing the European financial stability system .
<2en> All of those who observed that process know that it is a difficult operation and was carried out under time pressure .
<2en> For this reason , I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to all of those who contributed to bringing the project to fruition .
<2en> In this regard , the Belgian Presidency has left behind for the Hungarian Presidency a job well done .
<2en> It should also be stressed that the Belgians have marked out the path for future presidencies in the context of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> I would like to express the hope that future presidencies , including the Polish one , will try to set their own , clear priorities to a greater extent , while still placing them , however , within our common , European objectives .
<2en> This method of working allows the policies of European institutions to be planned and carried out to a greater extent .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to start by congratulating the Belgian Presidency , which demonstrated outstanding abilities while leading the European Council for the last six months .
<2en> The Belgian team can be considered all the more successful in view of the circumstances in which the country took over the Presidency .
<2en> Firstly , this was the first Presidency which had operated on the basis of the rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon , and secondly , the EU and its individual Member States were in an extremely difficult financial position .
<2en> In addition , Belgium had to deal with domestic problems during its Presidency .
<2en> In spite of it being such a difficult and demanding time , the Presidency showed how effective it could be , displaying true European style in the implementation of all measures .
<2en> It left its domestic problems and issues to one side and concentrated on following a course of action that corresponded to the proposals of the European Parliament , the European Commission and the European Council , and on supporting these institutions .
<2en> The Presidency took on the role of a mediator .
<2en> With regard to the priorities achieved by the Presidency , measures focused on combating the economic crisis deserve recognition ; I am thinking here , above all , of work on the next multiannual financial framework .
<2en> The Eurovignette is a further significant achievement of the Belgian Presidency .
<2en> Finally , I would like to say that the Belgian Presidency can serve as a good lesson for the next countries taking over the Presidency of the European Council .
<2en> I would like to wish both the Hungarian Presidency and the Polish Presidency , which will begin in the second half of 2011 , the same success .

<2en> I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency .
<2en> Its work , which has just come to an end , can serve as a model for the countries which will lead the work of the European Council in future .
<2en> This is a subject particularly close to my heart in view of Poland 's upcoming Presidency , which I hope will follow all the trails blazed so successfully under the Belgian Presidency .
<2en> It is not often the case that the country holding the Presidency puts Community measures before domestic interests .
<2en> In my opinion , the key success of the Presidency we are discussing was its consistent implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon , in particular , at the level of the European Council , which became a full institution with a permanent President , and at the level of the Foreign Affairs Council , which is currently headed by the High Representative .
<2en> Combating the economic crisis also proved to be a matter of no little significance , and the systematic monitoring and moderation of the financial sector will make it possible , over time , to restore its tarnished reputation .
<2en> This is particularly important at a time when there is so much pressure to extend the euro area .
<2en> To sum up , I sincerely hope that the path mapped out during the Belgian Presidency will serve as a quality standard for the countries taking over future presidencies .
<2en> May the good of the Community always be our priority .
<2en> Thank you .

<2en> The European Union and its institutions have a duty and responsibility to uphold respect for human rights , including those of all minorities .
<2en> It must therefore reject and combat any form of discrimination , specifically as regards sexual orientation .
<2en> In this context , I support Parliament 's resolution as an initiative reaffirming the values and principles upon which the European Union 's identity is founded , without putting the fundamental principle of subsidiarity at risk .
<2en> I would stress acknowledgement of and respect for the right of a Member State , such as Lithuania , to freely discuss and compare different concepts and ideas during the process of amending and passing national legislation .
<2en> I would also stress the Lithuanian authorities ' reaffirmation of their determination to respect the European legal framework and not go against it , as well as to promote respect for human rights .
<sp>
<2en> Lithuania is attempting to control the preaching of certain minority sexual orientations , no doubt wishing , and quite rightly so , to promote instead the family , consisting of a father , a mother and their children , which forms the fundamental unit of any society .
<2en> Some people see this as an unacceptable attack on human rights and as outright discrimination .
<2en> However , as the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) rightly points out , the legislative process under way in Lithuania is a long way from being completed and is currently being examined by the relevant oversight bodies in the light of the country 's constitutional and international obligations .
<2en> The resolution also emphasises ' the right of any democracy [ ... ] to modify and adopt national laws and provisions , without interfering in the debates of national parliaments ' .
<2en> However , the very fact that we are discussing the issue here and tabling texts constitutes interference and is a violation of Lithuania 's rights and those of its citizens .
<2en> This is unacceptable .
<2en> Since the subjects are connected , I would also like to take the opportunity as a French citizen to express my grave concern about the case taken to France 's Constitutional Court in the name of non-discrimination , challenging the articles of the Civil Code that quite naturally enshrine the principle of marriage as the union between a man and a woman .
<sp>
<2en> I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has taken a stand in calling on Lithuania to reject a bill to introduce fines for ' the public promotion of homosexual relations ' .
<2en> Let us remind ourselves that there is no place for homophobia in Europe and that Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights clearly prohibits all discrimination on a variety of different grounds , including sexual orientation .
<2en> The Council is still blocking the introduction of a cross-cutting directive on combating discrimination aimed at guaranteeing equal protection against all forms of discrimination .
<2en> However , it is high time we acted to prevent laws such as this one , which are far removed from the values we uphold here , from cropping up all over Europe .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - One of the earliest tasks of the re-established Scottish Parliament was to remove from the statute book a law prohibiting the ' promotion ' of homosexuality in Scotland 's schools .
<en> The law had been enacted by the right-wing unionist government of Margaret Thatcher - a government which had no legitimacy among the people of Scotland .
<en> The Scottish Parliament saw things differently and reformed the law to make it fitter for the 21st century .
<en> It is to be hoped that the people of Lithuania choose to be similarly minded .
<sp>
<2en> The European Parliament 's motto ' United in diversity ' is the principle that must guide all our work within and outside the European Union .
<2en> It was in line with this principle that I voted in favour of this resolution , because I believe that , while the European Parliament may not wish to interfere in a country 's internal affairs , it should always be able to express its opinions and to act as a sounding board in order to convey the needs of the European public as a whole .
<2en> The resolution adopted today serves to highlight our Parliament 's common position with regard to the Lithuanian Seimas .
<2en> It consists of a request to amend draft legislation that would amend the Code of Administrative Offences to punish the ' public promotion of homosexual relations ' , which , as the text clearly emphasises , could potentially criminalise almost any public expression or portrayal of , or information about , homosexuality .
<2en> Therefore , I believe that it is our duty today as MEPs , but as citizens before that , to ask the Lithuanian Parliament to reject the new legislation in the name of the essential principle of safeguarding fundamental human rights .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> In the present context of prioritising the fight against climate change , the defence and promotion of the Arctic region is of crucial importance , not only in environmental terms , but also in terms of economic development , and of global stability and security .
<2en> Its potential in terms of renewable energy supplies and fish is particularly important , meaning that the sustainable exploitation of the natural resources of this region is crucial .
<2en> However , we must not fail to give sufficient weight to the interests of this region 's indigenous peoples in this process .
<2en> In this respect , the European Union can and must take on a major role in protecting the culture , language , customs and living conditions of these indigenous communities .
<2en> Without this , any strategy of intervention to safeguard an extremely important region for the future of the world 's population and the planet will be at risk .
<2en> I would stress the importance of guaranteeing the best conditions for scientific research .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution on a sustainable EU policy for the High North .
<2en> The Arctic region is attracting more and more attention , due to the effects of climate change , the main trigger of developments .
<2en> Europe does not only bear a certain responsibility , being one of the main contributors to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions , but also has a particular interest in the Arctic , since it will have to deal with the consequences of the changes taking place there , from environmental and climate change issues to the geopolitics of shipping routes and security of supply of resources .
<2en> It is essential to formulate EU policy as regards the Arctic region with very specific and comprehensive proposals : from the inclusion of local inhabitants in the dialogue and stability and security in the region to the environmental and climate change dimensions of future projects .
<2en> The indigenous peoples have a right to an unpolluted natural environment .
<sp>
<2en> The region of the Arctic Ocean is assuming ever greater significance , not just for the continent of Europe , but for the whole world .
<2en> The climate change taking place in the far north is going to have colossal significance for all of humanity .
<2en> It is absolutely essential to concentrate efforts on scientific research and to develop a plan for tackling these changes .
<2en> The Arctic is also an area of resources , such as hydrocarbons , and of the potential for obtaining renewable energy such as wind or water power .
<2en> Another economically important resource are fish , which are of fundamental significance in the context of food security .
<2en> Neither can we forget about the maritime transport routes , which facilitate international trade and enable many enterprises to perform better .
<2en> In all these areas , the European Union can , and should , make a contribution , helping in the development of the region and setting new standards in striving to protect our planet 's environment .
<sp>
<2en> The High North is rich in resources and energy and will open up new sea routes that could be used by the European Union .
<2en> The mineral resources present there are valuable and must also be treated as such .
<2en> When extracting raw materials , it is important that the ecological system is not too badly affected .
<2en> The indigenous peoples also need special protection and consideration .
<2en> The Arctic is a world heritage site and must also be regarded as such .
<2en> Therefore , our focus should be on the preservation of this heritage , not the extraction of resources .
<2en> I support the report on a sustainable EU policy for the High North by my fellow Member , Mr Gahler .
<sp>
<2en> As the Gahler report states , ' the challenges facing the Arctic are global and should therefore include all relevant actors ' .
<2en> The issue of the Arctic region now requires our constant attention more than ever , because of the worrying problems caused by the effects of climate change .
<2en> The Arctic is , geopolitically , a very important region , containing an estimated one fifth of the world 's undiscovered hydrocarbon resources .
<2en> The fact that three EU Member States - Denmark , Finland and Sweden - are Arctic countries accounts for the Union 's interest in ensuring that environmental factors are henceforth taken far more into account than they are at present .
<2en> The Union has always fought for the environment and has made great efforts to protect it through preventive measures .
<2en> With the outcome of today 's vote in this House , it is once again strongly confirming its position .

<sp>
<2en> I am voting for this report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea .
<2en> I am doing so , firstly , because of the Commission proposal to develop the strategy for establishing measurable objectives and sectoral partnerships to facilitate joint projects , among other important measures .
<2en> My second reason is that the rapporteur presents the need for an up-to-date assessment of EU activity in the Black Sea region .
<2en> My last reason is because there is considerable fragmentation in funding for this strategy , as it is financed by various instruments .
<2en> To put an end to this fragmentation , it is proposed that this strategy has its own line of finance .
<2en> I also agree with the recommendations tabled in this report with a view to developing a stronger political framework , including an integrated approach to this region for the EU , which must be reinforced with the implementation of a specific action plan , and with adequate human and financial resources .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this resolution on an EU strategy for the Black Sea .
<en> I agree with the rapporteur 's opinion that given the strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU and the rather limited results of the Black Sea Synergy , a strategy should be launched to enhance the coherence and visibility of EU action in the region and that the EU Black Sea strategy should be an integral part of the EU 's broader foreign and security policy vision .
<en> Three years after devising the Black Sea Synergy , an analysis of the current situation indicates , first of all , the lack of a clear , comprehensive and updated picture on the implementation results of the Black Sea Synergy .
<en> Therefore , the EU strategy for the Black Sea should put in place a stronger policy framework and boost EU involvement in the Black Sea region .
<en> I support the opinion that the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace , stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region , while also ensuring EU energy security .
<en> As a consequence , security , good governance , energy , transport , environment , socio-economic and human development should be considered as priority actions .
<en> It is very important for a security dimension of the Black Sea to include resolute actions for strengthening democratic rule , good governance and State capacity building .
<sp>
<2en> For some 50 years now , the European Union has brought peace and stability to the peoples of Western Europe .
<2en> Nevertheless , we must not forget that our neighbouring countries continue to be plagued by serious unrest .
<2en> The Union must be sensitive to this situation and must give fresh impetus to its strategy for the Black Sea region .
<2en> This resolution provides such a response , and I therefore voted in favour of it .
<2en> It creates a new budget line , which will give priority to the financing of small-scale development projects and cross-border cooperation , and strengthens human resources .
<2en> An ' early-warning system ' will act as a conflict prevention and confidence building tool in the region by anticipating any escalation of violence .
<2en> The resolution draws attention , lastly , to the extended lease for Russia 's Black Sea Fleet in Crimea and the concerns that it raises .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report on an EU strategy for the Black Sea .
<2en> The strategic importance of the Black Sea region for the EU was recognised in 2007 , in the context of Romania 's and Bulgaria 's accession to the EU .
<2en> As developments in this region , strategically situated at the junction of Europe , the Middle East and Central Asia , started having a direct impact on EU internal affairs , the EU acknowledged the need to reflect upon its stronger involvement in the area .
<2en> This resulted in the launch of a new EU policy approach towards the region , called the Black Sea Synergy .
<2en> The aim of the Black Sea Synergy is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region , as well as within the region .
<2en> However , much less was achieved in the field of implementation , while sectors such as stability , democracy and good governance seem to have witnessed less progress in a context of deterioration of the democratic rule in several Black Sea states and of the Russia-Georgia war in 2008 .
<2en> Furthermore , the region continues to face the following challenges : protracted conflicts , trends towards militarisation and proliferation of arms , maritime surveillance , illicit trafficking and cross-border crime .
<2en> I believe that in order to achieve efficient implementation , it is necessary to devise mechanisms for regular reporting , monitoring , evaluation and follow-up .
<2en> In addition , the main objectives of a Black Sea strategy should entail building a space of peace , stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region , while also ensuring EU energy security .
<2en> As a consequence , security , good governance , energy , transport , environmental , socio-economic and human development should be considered as priority actions .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Ungureanu report , because I firmly believe that the EU urgently needs a cohesive and visible strategy for the Black Sea region .
<2en> The strategy should be closely linked to the European Neighbourhood Policy , the development of which was given a major boost by the Czech Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2009 .
<2en> The key priority of the EU 's Black Sea strategy should be to secure energy supplies to the EU , and related support for energy projects which are in the interests of the EU and which focus on diversifying gas supplies to the EU .
<2en> The establishment of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly is also important and urgently required as regards the EU 's energy security .
<2en> Among the projects which the Black Sea strategy should be helping to implement , I would include the Nabucco project , the South Stream project , the project to bring liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) to Europe and the development of LNG terminals in Black Sea harbours , and also the pan-European Constanta-Trieste oil pipeline .
<2en> The Commission should not delay and should conclude agreements by the end of 2011 with potential supplier countries for the Nabucco pipeline .
<2en> The package of measures for energy infrastructure , which the Commission intends to submit in the near future , should place particular emphasis on the previously mentioned energy projects in the Black Sea region .
<2en> Last but not least , it is necessary to emphasise the considerable potential of renewable energy sources in the Black Sea region , which may contribute significantly to the future energy security of the EU and the entire world .

<en> ( DE ) Madam President , the dictators in our neighbouring countries are being toppled and it is a good thing that they are going .
<en> Although our High Representatives in the European Union are not in a position or are not prepared to support and encourage those people who are fighting for democracy , it is good at least to be able to take action and provide help , even if we are not talking .
<en> However , it is very important for us to combine the aid we provide with a requirement to comply with our values , including democracy , the rule of law and core labour standards .
<en> It is essential for the European Union to provide help .
<en> In addition , we must not only help these people , but also ensure that they understand the values which have made us strong .
<en> Given that this is the case , it is clear to me that this aid must ultimately be controlled and managed by a democratic Parliament .
<en> In future , we must not allow the European Union 's actions to be controlled by a bureaucratic organisation .
<en> Parliament must be put in a position to fulfil its role as a parliamentary body , which means being able to take decisions .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Madam President , Parliament must be able to control on an equal footing with the Council the adoption of strategic decisions relating to how the resources allocated by the financing instruments for cooperation are spent .
<en> However , at the same time , the EU must become more flexible and speed up the mechanisms for developing trade relations with partner countries .
<en> I support the idea of the Union adopting a pragmatic approach in its economic relations with partner countries .
<en> I think that it is particularly important to implement financing instruments in countries like Turkmenistan and Iraq , which can provide energy resources through projects such as Nabucco .
<en> I would also like to mention here that the joint declaration from the presidents of Romania and Turkmenistan has marked the establishment of an energy partnership for exploiting and transporting natural gas and crude oil , including through the transfer of experience and equipment .
<en> Romania has also been involved in carrying out stabilisation and reconstruction missions in Iraq .
<sp>
<en> ( SL ) Madam President , a significant part of the resources which are available to us through financing instruments and which are intended for the development of developing countries ends up via certain channels back in the hands of our companies or monopolies at home .
<en> I think that an essential purpose of these financial and policy instruments should be to ensure that the resources are used in accordance with the development plans of those whom we want to support .
<en> Several speakers have already pointed out that we often finance regimes which are anything but democratic .
<en> When it comes to financing the development of the poorest countries , I think that we should be careful not to perpetuate the single-crop farming trend , but to open up opportunities for the modern development of these countries .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I have listened carefully to the numerous contributions .
<en> The Commission hopes that we will find a solution for these important financing instruments .
<en> However , we need to be able to fully implement external relations financial instruments .
<en> Proper implementation of our external actions should not be taken hostage by a dispute between the institutions .
<en> It is difficult to retain credibility vis-à-vis the outside world on such a basis , and this exposes us to loss of relevance as a global player and trade negotiator .
<en> The Commission stands ready to work towards a rapid solution that is agreed by all the institutions concerned .
<en> In the current instruments , which are in force until 2013 , which means another two years , multiannual strategy papers are considered to be implementing measures necessary for the implementation of the budget .
<en> Such measures are subject to the comitology system .
<en> Strategy papers are technical documents , and so by their nature are not suited to take the form of binding legal acts .
<en> The current instruments have only two more years to run and there remain only a few strategy papers to be put in place .
<en> The Commission considers that to change this system now would require significant changes to instruments , which would take too long to put in place and which would cause major disruption to EU external cooperation .
<en> The Commission already involves Parliament in the process of democratic scrutiny of strategy papers .
<en> The Commission is willing to reinforce this process with substantive scrutiny rights for Parliament .
<en> It is too soon to say what the new instruments will look like because they are subject to extensive consultation with stakeholders and to Commission proposals .
<en> Provided that the criteria established in Article 290 of the Lisbon Treaty are fully respected , the option is open to consider recourse to delegated acts in the new instruments , but the Commission does not yet have a set view on this question .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I too would like to thank all the speakers who talked about financing instruments in general and about those relating to the report that I have submitted to you this morning in particular .
<2en> I think that Mr Brok found the right words to express what we want .
<2en> We do not want to be troublemakers , but neither do we want to give the Commission carte blanche to implement fundamental agreements adopted by the European Parliament without there being any parliamentary oversight .
<2en> Between having everything or nothing , Parliament insisted on a sensible solution that consists in closely monitoring strategic acts .
<2en> We are demanding nothing more and nothing less than that .
<2en> I would also like to say a word about those who were more critical in their remarks , specifically those who spoke rather sceptically about development cooperation policy , and those who always refer to the taxpayer in order to reject any support for development cooperation policy .
<2en> From my point of view , the taxpayer finances a budget .
<2en> A budget is an instrument for showing solidarity with the least well off .
<2en> Hence , thanks to taxpayers ' contributions , the budget generally provides an opportunity for our countries to help the weakest in society .
<2en> The alternative would to be to ignore the basic , fundamental rights of people thus deprived of resources .
<2en> I would , however , recommend that those Members consult the reports of the United Nations Development Programme , to see that those who contribute the most in terms of cooperation and external solidarity are the ones who also spend the most on internal solidarity within their country .
<2en> In other words , there is no inherent contradiction between internal solidarity and external solidarity .
<2en> Those who would like the rest of the world to believe that any money of ours that is spent on external solidarity is money wasted in the four corners of the world would therefore be well advised to reread the statistics in the United Nations Human Development Report .

<2en> Despite being practically extinct in developed countries , tuberculosis remains a threat in poor and underdeveloped countries , particularly in Africa , where it continues to kill millions of people every year .
<2en> Only a vaccination plan at global level can bring an end to this scourge and make the total elimination of this disease by 2050 a reality , as part of achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
<sp>
<2en> I agree with much of what this motion for a resolution says , with its ultimate goal and with its view of access to healthcare as a right , the guaranteeing of which falls to governments that ' must meet their obligation to provide public health services to their entire population ' .
<2en> Nevertheless , I have not been able to support it because I view the majority of the proposals and goals that it sets out as lacking ambition and clearly insufficient .
<2en> I believe that it is not enough to suggest eradicating by 2050 a disease that affects the poorest and is one of the main causes of death in the world , leading to more than 2 million deaths every year .
<2en> This is because , as a number of studies carried out by non-governmental organisations point out , this period could be halved with a robust policy and the resulting increase in resources intended for combating it .
<2en> Furthermore , while I agree with the statement in paragraph 2 that it is important to improve detection and vaccination procedures with more effective diagnosis and treatments , I object to the failure to expressly mention that such services should be carried out by public health services ; it is these that should be strengthened by receiving European aid and cooperation .
<sp>
<2en> I am very happy to lend my support to a pan-European project that offers added value not only to Europe but also to the world in its aim of eventually eliminating tuberculosis .
<2en> In 2009 , tuberculosis killed 1.7 million people , or 4 700 people per day .
<2en> The World Bank estimates that it causes an annual economic loss to Africa of USD 52 billion .
<2en> The cases reported in the United Kingdom and Ireland in summer 2010 also remind us that this disease remains a serious problem for the European Union .
<2en> Thanks to the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative ( TBVI ) , it will be possible to create effective vaccines that are affordable for developing countries and adapted to emerging countries and Europe .
<2en> The European Commission is the largest donor of official development aid , providing EUR 49 billion per year .
<2en> It is not enough , however .
<2en> We must find other sources of funding , such as the establishment by the Member States and / or the European Union of a financial guarantee to enable funding to be obtained from the European Investment Bank .
<2en> The TBVI is a practical way of implementing the EU 2020 strategy .
<2en> By making Europe more attractive , it is preparing the new economy for future generations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The tuberculosis vaccine programme is very important , but what is the European Parliament going to do before 2015 ?
<en> In Latvia , for example , the process of medical treatment for tuberculosis currently consists of diagnosis-making and staying in quarantine .
<en> In fact , all the funds that were supposed to be spent on the purchase of medical equipment and the construction of specialised hospitals were spent in vain .
<en> For instance , in a town called Olaine there was a hospital constructed on the territory of a prison to treat people infected by tuberculosis .
<en> The amount of money spent to equip the hospital amounted to two million euro .
<en> That hospital is not functioning now since there is no medical staff !
<en> Therefore I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that it is not enough merely to create and produce a vaccine , it is necessary to prepare specialists with focused specialisation and highly qualified medical personnel and to deploy them in a battle against tuberculosis .
<en> Otherwise , the effect of today 's voting will be no more than emotional .
<en> It is highly important to have absolutely transparent scrutiny of funds allocated to the fight against tuberculosis in order not to repeat the Latvian situation .
<sp>
<2en> Every year EUR 2 billion is spent on treating people with tuberculosis in the European Union .
<2en> Alongside HIV and malaria , tuberculosis is one of the most widespread epidemics in the world .
<2en> Around one third of the world 's population is infected .
<2en> It is clear that we are far from eradicating tuberculosis .
<2en> As in the case of all diseases , increasing resistance in the form of multi-resistant or even ultra-resistant bacteria and the resulting lack of treatment options are presenting modern medicine with a major challenge .
<2en> The standard drugs , which have been used since the 1960s , have no impact on mutated variants .
<2en> As a result , other medicines are prescribed which are more expensive and have more powerful side effects .
<2en> The subsequent treatment costs can be up to one hundred times higher than those of normal tuberculosis .
<2en> If a patient stops taking the standard drugs for the normal form of tuberculosis before the end of the six-month period , the result is not only severe side effects , but also resistance .
<2en> In addition , it is only possible to stop the disease spreading by investigating all the people with whom the patient has had contact .
<2en> Some countries have not complied with these requirements .
<2en> If these well-known basic rules are not followed , research projects costing billions of euros are unlikely to bring about any major changes and new types of resistance will occur .
<2en> For this reason , I have abstained from voting .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , this debate on permitted levels of radioactivity in food is timely , because this April will be the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster .
<en> Many of us will remember how anxious members of the public were at that time and just how long the radioactive contamination lasted in certain places , such as the English Lake District , where soil conditions and heavy rainfall caused the ground to be contaminated for many years .
<en> So it is very important to have in place a system which will give the greatest possible reassurance to members of the public in the event of a nuclear accident .
<en> That is why we need a different legal basis and a panel of experts broadened to include independent scientific experts on public health and food safety .
<en> This is not just a technical subject that can be left to nuclear boffins .
<en> It is of much wider public concern .
<en> Similarly , it is essential that the levels of permitted radiation are set in a way that means food is safe to be consumed by people of all ages .
<en> Can you imagine the stress that would be caused if advice went out that said that carrots , for instance , could be safely eaten by adults and yet not by children ?
<en> We need clear guidelines that everyone can have confidence in .
<en> I therefore believe that we should follow the US model here and set the maximum effective dose limit at one microsievert per year for everybody .
<en> It is in any case high time that the levels in the annexes were reviewed , because they do not take account of changes in diet and cultural preferences .
<en> For example , cassava is a staple food for many people , not a minor substance .
<en> So the Commission needs to submit a full report on maximum permitted levels .
<en> Finally , I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Belet , for the very consensual approach that he has adopted on this report .
<en> I hope the Commission will bear in mind that Parliament is remarkably united on this dossier .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the reason we are discussing these proposals from the Commission is that the previous regulation lapsed in 2010 .
<2en> As I worked on this proposal , I was reminded how , in the mid-1980s , I worked with my predecessor from the Green Party here in Parliament , Mrs von Blottnitz , on the fall-out of the Chernobyl disaster .
<2en> One of the biggest problems after the Chernobyl accident was a lack of transparency and the failure of comprehensive democratic controls .
<2en> To be honest , I find it astonishing that we now find ourselves having to take an almost defensive line of argument because we cannot consider this issue on the basis of the Euratom regulations alone , but that we also have to consider consumer protection , protection for the population in the event of major accidents in nuclear power plants , based on the rules of the European Treaty , so that we have complete control and a say in the final outcome .
<2en> I would like to call once again on Mr Barnier , who is from France , to ensure that things change here .
<2en> At the time , France acted as if there was no problem and the radioactive clouds would somehow take a detour around its territory .
<2en> This was a shame , as people in France have become aware in retrospect .
<2en> Otherwise , I agree with Mrs Hall that we should follow the example of the United States by adopting a very conservative approach to the issue of regulation : limit values are not set for young people and the elderly , for the strong and the weak , but purely on the basis of what children can tolerate , so that the lowest possible limit values are applicable in the event of an accident .
<2en> The recommendations in the United States are ten times lower than those published today by the European Commission , based on the advice from Euratom .
<2en> I believe that you really should follow the lead provided here by myself and Mrs Hall .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I also would like to start by supporting those of my fellow Members who agree that , when we talk about radioactive contamination of food or the soil , we are talking about a public health problem .
<2en> This is basically the central question .
<2en> To begin with , the impact of these problems of excessive radioactive contamination is felt in health terms , particularly through an increase in cases of cancer and other health problems .
<2en> It is therefore no use having a legal basis that does not place public health at the centre of the issue .
<2en> We are all well aware of the importance of this debate .
<2en> We know this from Chernobyl , yet not only because of Chernobyl .
<2en> In fact , the importance of Chernobyl has been to show us the magnitude of this problem and the extent to which it can affect people 's lives .
<2en> It is vital that we learn the lessons that history has to teach us .
<2en> It is therefore down to us to put preventive measures and regulations in place .
<2en> With regard to the proposal that is being presented here , I feel that that the discussion today is clear .
<2en> Firstly , there is the positive aspect of attempting to bring this regulation into the public health domain , as I have already mentioned .
<2en> Secondly , we are trying to do away with certain inconsistent and sometimes even arbitrary measures .
<2en> Thirdly , the intention is to make the updating processes and the decision-making process more transparent and democratic .
<2en> The problem of the maximum levels remains , however .
<2en> We cannot continue to expose the most disadvantaged and most severely affected groups to such high levels .
<2en> The maximum levels must guarantee the safety of all citizens and we are all well aware of the fact that there are life-threatening cases like these in every country .
<2en> We have the case of Urgeiriça in Portugal , for example .
<2en> It is important that we take all this into account .

<2en> Mr President , we are about to make some important and necessary revisions to the limit values for radioactive contamination of foodstuffs .
<2en> I , of course , support the proposals that will ensure the best possible protection for citizens , including with regard to medical equipment .
<2en> Therefore , we clearly must make use of all of the new scientific data that is available and update the limit values accordingly , because it is self-evident that we must have a high level of health protection in the EU .
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon enables the adoption of joint measures in the veterinary sector for monitoring safety standards for food and feed with the direct aim of protecting public health , and that is a good thing , because it is extremely worrying that the EU is currently operating with higher limit values than the United States .
<2en> Radioactive radiation is not less dangerous for people , animals and crops in Europe than it is in the US .
<2en> In general , this proposal demonstrates how important it is for us to establish clear procedures and to update the old standards .
<2en> I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for these excellent and important amendments .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , regrettably , the Hungarian nation had direct experience of the serious contamination of foodstuffs due to a nuclear accident during the Chernobyl disaster .
<en> We must do our utmost to prevent the recurrence of such a dreadful event as the Chernobyl disaster .
<en> One element in preventing this is that existing and functioning nuclear power stations must be inspected extremely strictly .
<en> With a view to the future , however , I believe that the acceptable solution would be to place the emphasis on renewable energy sources , and not to increase , by any means , but rather reduce the role of nuclear energy in energy supply to the fullest extent possible .
<en> In any event , this is indispensable for the European Union from the aspect of energy security .
<en> This is the only way we can enhance our own security .
<en> We do not need to support and to take into consideration the atomic energy industry , but only the health of European people , our electors , and what is good and bad for them .
<en> I believe that devising an accident scenario for a potential disaster is important , but I see our primary task clearly to be the reduction , and indeed minimisation , of risks .
<en> This can be done : all it requires is political will and due determination on the part of my fellow Members as well .
<en> We must tackle the roots of the problem and not await a disaster passively .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , it can never be said often enough that what is happening in the southern Mediterranean and , more generally , in the Arab world , is historic , especially for those peoples who , half a century after their countries gained independence through decolonisation , are today gaining their individual and collective freedoms .
<en> It is historic , but also unexpected , as are all popular revolutions , I hear you say .
<en> However , this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision , our policies and our relationships with these countries .
<en> Proposals have been made .
<en> Indeed , the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability , by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears , an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration , terrorism and radical Islam , along with some economic interests , not least access to energy .
<en> We accepted authoritarian regimes , when their sole aim was to confirm our fears .
<en> The people 's revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see ; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears , or , worse still , the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs .
<en> That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy , in places where it is possible to be Muslim , democratic and secular .
<en> That is the message that we are being sent .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt are already creating a political domino effect in numerous Muslim countries .
<en> Communities are rising up with demands and requests which have been repressed for decades .
<en> Beware !
<en> Nothing has ended .
<en> It is all just starting .
<en> New challenges and new prospects .
<en> The question is what is Europe doing ?
<en> What can it do and what must it do ?
<en> Certainly not what is has being doing to date .
<en> It has basically been absent , with no cohesion and no reflexes .
<en> What will it do , for example , about the new influx of immigrants ?
<en> Surely not what it has been doing to date , with the lack of solidarity on the part of the North for its partners in the South ?
<en> That is why we and our colleagues from Cyprus , Malta , France , Spain and Italy have tabled a question to the Commission on the subject .
<en> Developments in our wider neighbourhood are becoming a yardstick for European foreign policy .
<en> Will we succeed or will we fail ?
<en> Time is running out .
<en> Lampedusa is calling us .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , my voice will also be one of praise for Baroness Ashton 's recent visit to Tunisia , and for her trip to Egypt next week .
<en> What can Europe do , as the previous speaker said ?
<en> It is crucial to give a clear indication of our support for these countries at this point in time .
<en> Geography and history make Europe the natural ally of the countries in the Mediterranean region .
<en> This is the right time to let them know how important they are to us , how radical a change they have brought to our neighbourhood policy , and what high hopes we have for this new Mediterranean region engendered by the young people of Egypt and Tunisia , much to our surprise and disbelief .
<en> We should now support this transformation , as other speakers have said .
<en> Above all , we should do this by dismantling the machinery of repression -let us not forget that the dictatorship continues even though the dictator may have stepped down- , lifting the state of emergency and helping pro-democracy forces so that Europe can make a genuine contribution to this process , so that democracy can become truly consolidated and a new partnership can be established .
<en> What has been said about the need to adapt instruments is by no means gratuitous .
<en> The truth is that one page has been wiped and we are now moving on to a new one .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Mr President , it is quite clear from the context of what Mr Verhofstadt has been saying here that the Egyptian democratic opposition forces have failed to organise a unified body representing the revolutionary forces from the streets .
<en> It is one thing to get rid of a dictator , but quite another thing to introduce a democratic regime .
<en> One of the fundamental features of the revolutions in Central Europe in 1989 was the ability immediately to create genuine organisations to represent the democratic , secular revolutionary forces .
<en> There is room here for the European Union to provide assistance .
<en> This is possibly more important than funding and other matters .
<en> These will be important in future stages .
<en> Who will sit down at a table at this point and genuinely negotiate with the military leaders ?
<en> Who will genuinely come forward in elections as the representative of these democratic forces ?
<en> This question remains undecided and the European Union can provide assistance here .
<en> If this can be done , we will not have to fear that Egypt will take the path of Iran but , on the contrary , we can be sure that Iran will take the path of Egypt .
<en> ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to say to my friend Mr Zala that I very much benefited from what he has said about his personal experience of being in a revolution .
<en> Mr Zala , there are two questions in this debate I would like your views on .
<en> To the people on the ground , if foreign countries fail to speak out for democracy , does that not help extremism , rather than hinder it ?
<en> If foreign countries do speak out for democracy , is that seen as interference and inappropriate ?
<en> I would appreciate your views .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> . - ( NL ) Mr President , tomorrow we will be voting on the free-trade agreement with South Korea .
<en> I must say that it looks good at first glance .
<en> The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) is a strong supporter of free trade .
<en> Unfortunately , the European Union could not resist adding a safeguard clause to the trade agreement .
<en> This means that non-competitive companies will be protected when unable to hold their own when faced with competition from Korean products .
<en> In other words , should the European consumer choose to buy Korean products , rather than European ones , for the simple reason that the former may be better quality or cheaper , then trade barriers will once again be erected .
<en> Look how the vicious European reflex towards protectionism and market intervention is rearing its head again .
<en> Mr President , free trade that does not entail any disadvantage for European industry is , of course , an illusion .
<en> Therefore , trying to overcome this by including a safeguard clause and offering compensation to disadvantaged industries is a totally misguided solution .
<en> This will allow industries that are competing poorly to carry on doing what they have always done , instead of adapting to the competition .
<en> Worse still , who will ultimately be footing this bill ?
<en> Exactly : our citizens , unfortunately .
<en> As consumers , they will be forced to pay over the odds for their purchases and , on top of that , as taxpayers , they will even have to cough up the required compensation .
<en> How am I supposed to explain to my constituents that they will soon have to foot the bill if , for example , Fiat loses some of its market share to Kia ?
<en> These rules have no place in a free trade agreement .
<en> In practice , this is nothing other than subsidising inefficient companies on the backs of European citizens .
<en> Free trade ?
<en> What a great idea , but please let us drop this safeguard clause .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , South Korea is indeed a very important market for products from European industry - that has been emphasised and cars have been highlighted - but also for farmers .
<en> I would emphasise that we need it to be a win-win situation .
<en> There is a new generation coming up , which is a good thing .
<en> The agreement with South Korea contains a chapter on sustainable development , which covers labour standards , environmental policy and a monitoring mechanism that is to involve civil society .
<en> That is also good .
<en> The Free Trade Agreement is a step in the right direction , and I would like to thank everyone involved and emphasise that some excellent work has been done .
<en> Nevertheless , I would also call for clear rules for the production chain as a whole , particularly with regard to food .
<en> We should not only consider the end product , and it should not only be the agricultural industry that benefits ; farmers should benefit , too .
<en> In the interests of European consumers and our farmers , when trade flows are liberalised it absolutely must be ensured that agricultural products that are imported into the European Union meet our high standards in respect of environmental , animal and consumer protection , including at their point of origin and throughout the production chain .
<en> I will support the position of the Committee on International Trade tomorrow , but where further liberalisation efforts are concerned I would call strongly for the food sector and farmers also to be taken into account .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , in my capacity as Chair of the Committee on International Trade , I should like , first and foremost , to express my satisfaction that we are about to successfully conclude our first major test in exercising the codecision powers that the Treaty of Lisbon has granted us in the area of trade agreements .
<en> I feel that we exercised our powers with a great sense of responsibility , and I believe that it is only right that I should thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs , and also express my gratitude for the spirit of cooperation on the part of the Commission and the Council , under the Belgian Presidency , during the negotiations on the safeguard regulation .
<en> It should be noted that in the vote that took place in the Committee on International Trade , there was an overwhelming majority in favour of recommending approval of the trade agreement and adopting the regulation on the safeguard mechanism .
<en> This demonstrates that Parliament is capable of forming a broad-based political coalition for more openness in international trade , in line with one of the principles laid down in the trade agreement itself , in fact .
<en> The trade agreement is , to my mind , mutually beneficial .
<en> With the mutual opening of both markets , each economy can profit from their competitive advantages .
<en> The trade agreement will not only remove tariff and non-tariff barriers , but will also encompass the opening up of the public procurement market , safeguard intellectual property rights , and protect employment rights and environmental standards .
<en> Once the agreement has been ratified , which will be tomorrow , I hope , we must move resolutely to the next stage , which is its implementation .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us .
<en> I am talking about the refund of customs duties that Korea will receive for imports of products from China or other countries .
<en> We have already discussed this , but as a liberal democrat I consider this measure to be deeply flawed .
<en> It is a kind of export subsidy , and I would like it if , when voting on this agreement , we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements .
<en> Tomorrow 's vote will conclude one leg of the journey we have undertaken together , but only one leg , because the relationship between Parliament and the Commission must continue , not least with regard to the actual implementation of the safeguard clause .
<en> For the sake of European industry and European workers , we cannot make any mistakes when implementing it , or else we will face great problems in future agreements .
<en> This is the Year of the Rabbit in the Far East , so I hope European industry will run like a rabbit , taking advantage of what this agreement can offer it .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I still remember very well how - as is happening now in Egypt and Tunisia - the people in Korea , particularly the young people , took to the streets and , in the face of police truncheons and weapon , fought for freedom , democracy and self-determination .
<en> What has happened since then is unbelievable .
<en> It is unbelievable how much has been achieved in Korea in respect of democracy , self-determination and freedom , but also with regard to the economy and now increasingly also the environment .
<en> This makes Korea a good example for many other Asian countries , and it is also a country our ever closer cooperation with which I very much welcome , along with our work to break down customs barriers and to establish fairer trade .
<en> Nevertheless , we are rejecting this agreement today and there are a number of specific reasons for this , some of which have been mentioned by my colleague Mr Jadot .
<en> In addition to what has been said , I would also like to mention the regulation in the area of the financial sector , which we consider to be a step in the wrong direction .
<en> However , there are also fundamental reasons for this .
<en> We are concluding more and more free trade agreements , each one giving rise to another one .
<en> What we need is not a patchwork of more new individual agreements , but just and fair rules for world trade as a whole .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , everybody has said that the free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea is an institutional and strategic innovation on the part of the Union .
<en> On the contrary , it is an unbalanced agreement that will have a negative impact on the European manufacturing industry .
<en> The elimination of duties on Korean products in return for a rise in environmental and social standards in Korea cannot be considered fair .
<en> The Korean shipbuilding industry benefits from substantial state aid , which has enabled it to attain a 30 % share of the world market .
<en> This means that European industry , be it automotive , textile , chemical or any other , must defend itself against competition that if not unfair in form , is unfair in fact .
<en> The introduction of the safeguard clause is an appropriate measure , but it is not sufficient to patch up the many weaknesses in the agreement .
<en> I therefore call on the European Commission to be more prudent if it really wishes to defend European economic interests .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , this is the pinnacle of a vision of trade that is geared solely towards competition instead of towards harmonisation and reciprocity ; that is to say competition between countries , producers and workers .
<en> Large economic groups and transnational companies are , as always , expected to see a profit worth millions of euros with this Free Trade Agreement .
<en> However , as always , the other side of the coin is missing : the sacrifice of millions of small producers and small and medium-sized enterprises , environmental sacrifices , the destruction of production capacity and jobs , and the onslaught on wages and workers ' rights .
<en> This agreement will primarily affect countries like Portugal and the regions that are most dependent on the sectors concerned : textiles , automobiles related components , and electronics .
<en> It is significant that the rapporteur himself has already predicted the inevitable redundancies throughout Europe , but we also know that trade unions and rural organisations in the Republic of Korea are against this agreement .
<en> It is therefore clear who the winners and who the losers will be when it is eventually concluded .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , this trade agreement with South Korea is ambitious and comprehensive .
<en> It will help remove major trade barriers and European companies will be able to benefit from that .
<en> Increased access to the South Korean market will improve European companies ' market position .
<en> Given the fact that other major players , such as the United States , Chile and the EFTA countries , aspire to or have already entered into trade agreements with South Korea , this is a very important step .
<en> With this agreement , the European Union has shown that it is not cutting itself off from open and sustainable trade , at a time when some other nations are showing protectionist tendencies .
<en> Trade offers a way out of the economic crisis .
<en> However , free trade must not be allowed to lead to freebooting .
<en> The steel and car industries are worried about this , and not entirely without reason .
<en> Therefore , when implementing the agreement , we must closely monitor whether all the conditions are being met and we must ensure that we are able to deploy bilateral safeguard clauses , quickly and effectively , if necessary .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I will try to be extremely brief .
<en> First , regarding the question asked by the Earl of Dartmouth , in a case involving the infringement of intellectual property rights , including patents in third countries , it is appropriate that the operators concerned have recourse to the available enforcement means , including legal proceedings if necessary , as this is a case between two private firms .
<en> In the specific case of Avon Protection , it would be appropriate for your constituent first to seek redress for the alleged infringement of the patent via the existing legal framework in Korea .
<en> Should the available enforcement in Korea not be fair or expeditious enough , then the Commission could look into the matter .
<en> Regarding the remarks made by Mr Jadot , the initial draft of the Korean legislation would have forced EU car makers to reduce the CO2 emissions of their cars twice as much as Korean car makers .
<en> This was mainly because the proposed emission cuts were not proportional , but highly progressive , depending on the level of emissions of the respective cars .
<en> Consequently , despite being responsible for only a small share of car sales in Korea - 3 % in 2009 - and therefore of total CO2 car emissions in Korea , EU car makers would have been asked to contribute disproportionately .
<en> Their average emissions reduction between 2009 and 2015 would have been 23 % , compared with just 10 % for their Korean counterparts , which account for 95 % of total car sales in Korea .
<en> Such burden sharing would not have been fair , and that is why we discussed it with the Korean counterpart .
<en> Finally , I would like to thank everybody involved in this legislative process - the Committee on International Trade ( INTA ) , the Commission rapporteurs , the Chair of the INTA Committee , the Council and my own staff at the Commission - for what , I would say , is a very good example of what the ratification procedure should be under the Treaty of Lisbon .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner also .
<en> The whole process has been excellent .
<en> Over the years I have worked on a number of codecision procedures and I have to say this has been one of the best .
<en> The debate among my shadow rapporteurs has been phenomenal .
<en> We have had extremely good input from virtually everybody .
<en> I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Moreira , the Chair .
<en> Without his expertise , I do not think we would have got a satisfactory conclusion on the comitology issue - a particularly difficult sticking point towards the end of the negotiations .
<en> There have been a number of issues raised today .
<en> I would just like to say to Mr Jadot : I think your pig producers in Brittany may well benefit significantly hopefully , Yannick , because pig producers across Europe are having a bad time .
<en> I only pick on that because I am involved in agriculture .
<en> As I said , the quality of the debate has been excellent .
<en> There always will be two views and Mr Susta is absolutely right : there is always a split between the protectionist and the free marketeer .
<en> I would just say that we cannot stick our head in the sand and close the door and expect the world not to move on without us , because it will move on without us .
<en> We live in a global market , whether we like it or not .
<en> There are problems with that but it is a fact .
<en> I believe quite strongly that this offers huge opportunities for the European Union to move out of its problems with the financial crisis .
<en> We have set a standard for future agreements .
<en> However , they will not be as easy as this one .
<en> I am sure that we will move onto other far more difficult ones and we look forward to working with the Commission on that .
<en> I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate tonight .
<en> It has been excellent and it shows how comprehensive this House can be .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place at midday tomorrow ( Thursday , 17 February 2011 ) .
<en> Written Statements ( Rule 149 )
<sp>
<2en> I think that the entry into force of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement would have a positive impact on the European Union 's economy .
<2en> Firstly , it would help achieve customs duty savings estimated at EUR 1.6 billion a year .
<2en> We would also see an increase in trade , especially in the services sector where the future growth in trade is estimated at 70 % , and in the agricultural sector where , just at the moment , European Union exports to Korea have an annual value of EUR 1 billion .
<2en> At the same time , this is an ambitious and innovative agreement .
<2en> It is the first in a new generation of free trade agreements which contain both a chapter on sustainable development and compliance with labour standards and a monitoring mechanism in which civil society will be involved .
<2en> The fears about the difficulties which Korean competition could cause the Union 's more sensitive industries , such as the car industry , are dispelled by the inclusion of the Safeguard Clause in the agreement .
<2en> This will be used to impose measures for monitoring imports and exports and evaluating the impact of the agreement on the various sectors .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> We recognise and acknowledge the importance of multilateral cooperation for the promotion of the proper conservation and management of marine biological resources - the subject of this agreement .
<2en> However , the proposal for a regulation that was approved contains a provision that we consider to be unacceptable and which we sought to amend , proposing the removal of a paragraph from Article 28 .
<2en> This having been rejected by the majority , we voted against the final proposal for a regulation .
<2en> It aims to confer on the Commission the power to adopt delegated acts that could affect an area forming part of the Exclusive Economic Zone ( EEZ ) of a Member State .
<2en> The area is known as Eratosthenes Seamount and is part of the EEZ of the Republic of Cyprus .
<2en> This possibility clashes with the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus , particularly as this is an area that is highly sensitive from a political point of view , given that the area in question is disputed , illegally , by a third country that is a candidate for EU membership .
<2en> The seabed in this area contains natural resources that the Republic of Cyprus has a legitimate right to exploit , in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
<2en> In this context , the EU 's remit should not go beyond questions relating to the common fisheries policy .
<sp>
<2en> We have always attached the greatest importance to multilateral cooperation at the level of the promotion of the proper conservation and management of marine biological resources , which is the subject of this agreement .
<2en> However , the proposal for a regulation that was approved contains a provision that we consider to be unacceptable and which we sought to amend , by proposing the removal of a paragraph from Article 28 .
<2en> This having been rejected by the majority , we voted against the final draft regulation .
<2en> The sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus is called into question , even more so as this is an area that is highly sensitive from a political point of view , given that the area in question is disputed , illegally , by a third country that is a candidate for EU membership .
<2en> The seabed in this area contains natural resources that the Republic of Cyprus has a legitimate right to exploit , in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
<2en> In this context , the EU 's remit should not go beyond questions relating to the common fisheries policy .
<sp>
<2en> I agreed with this document , as the main tasks of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean ( GFCM ) are to promote the development , conservation and rational management of living aquatic resources , to formulate and recommend conservation measures , and to promote cooperative projects in the area of training .
<2en> The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM , and already in effect in the GFCM 's contracting States , in a single Community legislative act .
<2en> This would mark an important step towards simplification , given that hitherto , the European Community has just adopted annual regulations for the purpose of adapting and updating the existing rules .
<2en> The proposal features a series of smart solutions .
<2en> For example , with regard to fishing gear , the proposal for a regulation specifies in detail the minimum mesh size to be used in the Mediterranean Sea ( Article 15 ) and the Black Sea ( Article 16 ) and prohibits the use of towed dredgers and trawl nets at depths below 1 000 metres ( Article 17 ) .
<2en> It also tackles issues surrounding vessels engaged in illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU ) fishing , etc .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for the report on the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean ( GFCM ) Agreement Area .
<en> The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM , and already in effect in the GFCM 's contracting States , into a single Community legislative act into which future recommendations can be incorporated by way of amendments to that act .
<en> This would mark an important step towards simplification , given that up to now , the European Community has only adopted annual regulations for the purpose of adapting and updating the existing rules .
<sp>
<2en> European Union membership of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean ( GFCM ) faces a major turning point with this proposal for a regulation .
<2en> It is , in fact , proving to be extremely interesting in providing for the implementation of certain recommendations adopted by the GFCM in a single piece of EU legislation .
<2en> Such an act constitutes a legal instrument that is certainly more stable than the present one and allows future recommendations to be added only by an amendment of the law itself .
<2en> It represents a major step towards improving legal certainty and also contributes to the simplification of regulations .
<2en> Over and above the relevance of provisions in respect of a minimum mesh size for fishing nets , Article 28 of this proposed regulation also questions the powers of Parliament .
<2en> In fact , it states that the provisions contained in the regulation can be changed under the ' comitology procedure ' whereby the Commission is assisted by management committees , chaired by a representative of the Commission and composed of representatives of Member States .
<2en> This would effectively deprive Parliament of its powers , and it therefore appears desirable that the Commission should operate through delegated acts , with the possibility of Parliament or the Council withdrawing the delegated powers .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> At a time when we are still fully feeling the social effects of the economic and financial crisis in our respective European societies , it was important to vote today for Mrs Estrela 's report on reducing health inequalities .
<2en> Indeed , this report is a reminder that inequalities also affect health services and that it is important to act on the fundamental causes of those inequalities so that all European citizens can at last enjoy their fundamental social rights .
<2en> Citizens are not equal , whether in terms of life expectancy , poverty or social exclusion , and they are not all exposed to health risks .
<2en> The report also mentions undocumented migrants , who often face tremendous difficulty in accessing health services in host countries .
<2en> Hence , we invite the Member States to improve access to healthcare for all , whether citizens or not , and call on them to further coordinate their national health policies .
<2en> Indeed , access to high quality healthcare is one of the most fundamental rights and should therefore be a priority both for the Union and for the Member States , which still have jurisdiction in this area .
<sp>
<2en> In the European Union , there are significant health inequalities and measures to tackle these inequalities also vary widely within Member States .
<2en> Since I believe that these differences in health matters can have a considerable influence on individuals throughout their lifetime , they pose a problem to be tackled with determination and with an innovative political outlook .
<2en> This report contains very interesting solutions for acknowledging the specific right to health of citizens , in particular , by focusing both on training the population and on health service coverage .
<2en> The social consequences of the recent economic and financial crisis are obvious : since the crisis began , the number of jobless people has increased by 5 million , many households have been affected by the recession and are now more at risk of poverty or a situation of excessive indebtedness .
<2en> I think it is essential that reducing these inequalities should be considered a priority at all levels of decision making .
<2en> I also call on the Commission to give them greater recognition in the EU 2020 strategy and to ensure that the objective of reducing health inequalities is fully taken into account in future initiatives .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because health inequalities are a problem that needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency .
<2en> They start early in life and persist not only into old age but subsequent generations .
<2en> Inequalities experienced in earlier life in access to education , employment and healthcare , as well as those based on gender and cultural background , can have a critical bearing on the health status of people throughout their lives .
<2en> Furthermore , poverty and social exclusion have a significant impact on the state of health .
<2en> The reasons for these differences in health are , in many cases , avoidable and unjust .
<2en> In order to tackle health inequalities , specific measures need to be taken , particularly as regards the most vulnerable groups .
<2en> It is essential that the reduction of health inequalities is considered an essential priority , ensuring effective impact assessments in the area of health .
<sp>
<2en> The crisis has hit healthcare services hard in several EU Member States in terms of both supply and demand .
<2en> On the supply side , the economic and financial crisis has resulted in a fall in the level of funds allocated to public health and healthcare services , and in the long term too , as a result of budget cuts and lower revenues obtained from the collection of taxes .
<2en> On the other hand , the demand for healthcare services has risen in the long term as well , as a result of a combination of factors contributing to the deterioration in the population 's state of health in general .
<2en> Several Member States have included as part of their recovery packages measures to alleviate the effects of the economic crisis on healthcare services , by investing in the health service 's infrastructure , making optimum use of the funds allocated to healthcare services , as well as by restructuring and reorganising the healthcare system .
<2en> However , there are large discrepancies in Member States in terms of measures adopted to combat inequalities .
<2en> Access is a key issue in the case of all public services .
<2en> Gathering and exchanging evidence on effective strategies , policies and measures will help obtain support at administrative level and in different sectors .
<sp>
<2en> I agree with the assertion of the rapporteur , Mrs Estrela , that enormous health disparities exist both between people who live in different regions of the EU and between more advantaged and less advantaged population groups .
<2en> These inequalities tend to begin at birth and persist into old age , influenced throughout life by access to education , employment and healthcare , and may be exacerbated by differences based on gender and race .
<2en> It is essential to reduce the size of the existing disparities , which jeopardise the commitments made by the EU with regard to solidarity , social and economic cohesion , human rights and equality of opportunity , as a result of which this is one of the priority actions within the 2008-2013 EU strategy for health .
<2en> However , it is important to recognise that health policy is the responsibility of the Member States , together with the establishment of respective systems for people to access healthcare .
<2en> The report describes several interesting measures , but does not examine their financial impact .
<2en> I am also unhappy with the introduction of the question of abortion , which is part of a national and not European remit .
<chp>

<2en> Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Tannock for his constructive cooperation on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , too .
<2en> I am pleased that Montenegro can now pursue a path towards EU membership .
<2en> I agree that the Commission should initiate the negotiations as soon as possible , provided , of course , that Montenegro continues to move towards the EU 's targets .
<2en> The fact that Montenegro has now been granted candidate status sends out a strong signal about the EU 's commitment to the future of whole of the former Yugoslavia in the EU .
<2en> Like Croatia , Montenegro can show the remaining countries the way to EU membership .
<2en> Rapprochement to the EU is a key factor for both prosperity and stability in the region .
<2en> That is abundantly clear .
<2en> Montenegro is a small , new and peaceful country that is strongly committed to regional cooperation .
<2en> It has good relations with its neighbouring countries and , hence , good prerequisites for success in the forthcoming membership negotiations .
<2en> However , there are areas that require vigorous reforms .
<2en> The legal and administrative capacity to form a fully viable society based on the rule of law has been strengthened , but more is still required .
<2en> Corruption and organised crime are rife and the legal system needs a great deal of further enhancement in order to meet the EU 's requirements .
<2en> I have tabled a number of amendments in order to point out that Montenegro also needs to strengthen the position of women , secure freedom of the press , safeguard the fundamental rights of workers and minorities and , in particular , develop civil society .
<2en> We must not forget that these , too , are crucial areas in the forthcoming EU negotiations .
<2en> I welcome Montenegro 's membership of the European Union as soon as possible .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Tannock on his report and on the cooperation he has shown in formulating it .
<2en> If , by adopting the resolution on Montenegro , we wish to renew , in principle , the commitment towards continuation of the process of European Union enlargement and towards enabling all the states of our continent to develop under the aegis of Union membership , then we first need to ensure fulfilment of the following steps , first of all for Montenegro , and then also for Serbia , Macedonia , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania , not forgetting Turkey of course .
<2en> For Montenegro , this would mean that the granting of candidate status and the decision , in principle , to start negotiations should be followed by the actual opening of negotiations .
<2en> Meanwhile , much more work awaits the Montenegrin Government in terms of harmonising legal systems and enabling administrative capacities .
<2en> The fight against corruption , in all its diverse forms , must continue and must result in the conviction of those who have engaged in corrupt practices .
<2en> Ensuring equality and respect for women is not a task that deserves to be highlighted today only .
<2en> Freedom of expression , media independence and protection of minorities are all values which any candidate for membership in the European Union must unconditionally respect .
<2en> The young Montenegrin democracy must provide an appropriate and prominent place in its society for NGOs .
<2en> Commissioner , I would like to bring to your attention a particular wish which I heard while staying in Montenegro and speaking to its politicians there .
<2en> It is important that relations between Montenegro and Serbia evolve without Serbia attempting to interfere with its neighbour 's development through ethnic Serbian parties .
<2en> That school of thought has already done great damage in the history of south-eastern Europe .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , Commissioner , I would also like to thank our colleague , Charles Tannock , for a very good and well-balanced report and I am glad we found consensus here in regretting the decoupling of the candidate status for Montenegro from opening the negotiations .
<en> As previous speakers have said , I would also like Montenegro to move forward with negotiations and I hope the delay will not be too long .
<en> I am happy also to hear from the Hungarian Presidency that they are strong supporters in the enlargement process .
<en> So I hope there will be progress this year , at the latest , following the progress report .
<en> Montenegro has achieved a lot in the past and in recent years , but there are still quite a few areas of concern .
<en> I would like to mention three : fighting corruption , discrimination and ecological issues .
<en> In the fight against corruption and organised crime , I am glad that in this report , we also demand from the state authorities that they refrain from pressurising NGOs and civil society organisations that investigate corruption and organised crime .
<en> They should be free to do their work and support the state in removing corruption and organised crime .
<en> The second aspect is anti-discrimination .
<en> There are still lots of groups where , despite good legislation , anti-discrimination is not working : Roma , Ashkaeli and Egyptians , LGBT people ; we should also mention gender equality on International Women 's Day .
<en> Finally , on ecological issues , Montenegro defines itself in its constitution as an ecological state , which is great .
<en> The problem is , despite the beautiful coast and mountains , if good transparent progress is not made by having environmental assessments , then this beautiful countryside is in danger of being destroyed .
<en> So , I hope that this country will move forward , involve civil society , and have transparent processes in its ecological areas , especially hydro-electric power plants .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I agree with most of the speakers so far that Montenegro has made considerable progress towards EU integration despite a poor starting position .
<en> In common with the other former Yugoslav republics , it has had to cope with the collapse of Communism , coming together with the collapse of the state , the war that followed , and then having to build a new system on the ruins of the old .
<en> This is no easy task and some of the negative features of the previous system have lived on in new guises .
<en> What is important , however , is the emergence of a younger élite that has committed itself to a European future , in which it was certainly helped by the unsuccessful union with Serbia .
<en> Problems remain , of course .
<en> We have heard about some of these , the usual ones that former Communist states have had to cope with : corruption , criminality , abuses in the administration of justice , a not particularly efficient public service , and the like .
<en> The remedying of these and parallel flaws in the political , economic , legal and administrative systems will require a major effort on the part of the leadership , and it should be prepared for both active and passive resistance from the beneficiaries of the existing system .
<en> Every former Communist country has had to face analogous difficulties .
<en> The determination of both élites and public opinion to offer a European future is probably the single most important factor ensuring Montenegro 's eventual accession to the EU .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Madam President , progress in the European integration process is one of the fundamental factors contributing to the further development of Montenegro .
<en> From an economic perspective , the country has achieved a certain level of macro-economic stability , and has also advanced successfully in the sense of fulfilling the political criteria set out at the Copenhagen Summit , or the Copenhagen sitting of the Council .
<en> However , we must bring more pressure to bear , especially in the area of strengthening the rule of law - including reforms to the judiciary - and it is also essential to continue the ongoing effort in the fight against corruption and organised crime .
<en> It is also desirable to see progress in the reform of the public administration and electoral reform , and a stronger role for parliament
<en> Emphasis must be placed on the implementation of freedom of expression and media freedom .
<en> It would also be appropriate to cooperate with civil society , and to try and address discrimination and the social and economic integration of minority groups in the population , including the Roma .
<en> Regional cooperation and correct neighbourly relations are undoubtedly one of the other preconditions for a successful Euro-integration process .
<en> Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Montenegro has made a considerable effort in the attempt to fulfil the criteria set out for successful integration into the European Union , and it is therefore time to consider granting candidate country status .
<en> I believe that this will be achieved .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) The resolution on the proposal to amend the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , approved in Parliament , concerning the provision of a European stability mechanism for the euro area , is an important goal for strengthening the cohesion and competitiveness of the economy and stabilising the financial system .
<en> I voted for the amendment , given the significance of the euro to the European political and economic plan for sustainable growth .
<en> The stabilisation of the euro area is of strategic importance , and I believe that Europe must include measures to strengthen it , increasing its economic governance in light of the objectives to be pursued by the EU 2020 Strategy .
<en> Lastly , I believe in the need for a permanent stability mechanism to provide for the involvement of Community institutions , both to avoid the setting-up of double structures and because establishing a mechanism outside the institutional framework of the EU would constitute a threat to the integrity of the system based on the Treaties .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I rejected the proposal as a whole as I do not believe it solves the problems .
<en> I agree with ETUC when they say that the proposed changes will be ' ... paving the way to interfere with social dialogue and intervene in collective bargaining systems all over Europe ' .
<en> Furthermore I disagree with the choice of the simplified Treaty revision procedure .
<en> I believe that the ordinary Treaty revision procedure should be used in order to allow for a proper and in-depth discussion about the proposed stability mechanism and other possible changes to the Treaties , for example a social progress clause .
<en> Finally , I urge the Member States to enable referenda in all Member States on proposals for Treaty change .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I regard the stability mechanism as being particularly important and vital to the Member States which use the euro as their currency in terms of strengthening the single currency and supporting the European political and economic project .
<en> Strengthening and ensuring the stability of the single currency provide the market with security and make adopting the euro more attractive to new Member States .
<en> This matter is crucial to Europe 's growth and development , values which I support in every respect .
<en> Consequently , I voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am pleased with the results which Parliament has secured through negotiations with the Council , and as a result I supported this Treaty change .
<en> Giving a legal basis to a stability mechanism is vital to the immediate and long-term stability of the euro zone .
<en> The Council has given assurances that in future there will be a strong role for the Parliament and the Commission , which I believe is very important .
<en> While I approve this Treaty change I have very serious concerns regarding the current economic governance proposals , and voting in favour of this report is not an endorsement of the current economic governance package .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) The new European stability mechanism requires an amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon , to ensure its legally valid inclusion within the institutional framework of the European Union .
<en> We believe that this should be accompanied by a strengthening of the preventive and corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and measures relating to medium- and long-term competitiveness .
<en> Measures , in other words , capable of promoting a common European response , in order to better address the macro-economic imbalances between Member States and to ensure their sustainable growth .
<en> The European stability mechanism is therefore an important element of a comprehensive package of new measures ( together with the European Semesters and the EU 2020 Strategy ) , aimed at establishing a new framework for strengthening and coordinating economic and financial policies and budgetary discipline .
<en> To ensure respect for the core principles of democratic decision-making such as transparency , parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability , Parliament must be adequately informed and involved .
<en> In addition , we support the need for each national parliament to be fully involved , in accordance with their budgetary and control rights , in order to increase the transparency , ownership and accountability of decisions taken , including at European level .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the text voted on today is the result of a long and complicated journey that began in October 2008 with the aim of putting the consumer at the heart of the protection offered for purchases made abroad .
<en> The objective that the Union and the EU institutions must set themselves is to help the internal market to function better , with the aim of increasing consumer confidence whilst at the same time supporting our businesses .
<en> The directive voted on today by this House represents the synthesis of four directives on this issue which were in force until today .
<en> The directive shows our desire to harmonise the regulations currently in force in the different legal systems in a much more incisive way , avoiding the legal fragmentation that unfortunately has very often ended up being a hindrance both to undertakings - whose aim is to be able to be competitive on the cross-border market - and to consumers .
<en> For these reasons , I consented to and voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , the reform of the directive on consumer rights has been a long and sporadic process .
<en> The Commission 's original idea for fullscale harmonisation threatened to impair levels of consumer protection , particular that of consumers in the Nordic countries .
<en> This would have been contrary to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , according to which consumer legislation must be based on levels of consumer protection that are as high as possible .
<en> We should therefore always remember that the markets are for consumers , and it is not the case that consumers are for the markets .
<en> Legislation on consumers and small entrepreneurs must always be as clear as possible and easy to understand .
<en> Legislation that is precisely and carefully drafted is in the interests of all parties .
<en> Accordingly , it is good that the directive is being referred back to committee , as Parliament today decided it should .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , up until now the internal market of the European Union has been developed on the terms of mainly large companies .
<en> Now it is time to turn our attention to small and mediumsized enterprises and , above all , consumers , to ensure that their interests in the internal market are more vigorously protected .
<en> This Commission proposal to reform consumer protection has met with a fairly controversial reception .
<en> In Finland , for example , the Consumers ' Association collected signatures on a petition , stating that the proposal , if it had gone ahead , would have harmed consumer protection in Finland irreparably .
<en> This compromise we have now voted on , which will go for further discussion , is very obscure .
<en> A large number of the original proposals have been cut out , with the result that it is in no way ambitious .
<en> The biggest problem , however , is that it is actually hard to understand .
<en> I would like to make it a condition that the directive on consumer rights should be one that consumers also understand , thus offering them protection .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , my Finnish fellow Members who spoke before me , Mr Repo and Mrs Jäätteenmäki , expressed some welcome views regarding this directive on consumer rights .
<en> As Finns and Nordic people , we are worried that consumer protection might be impaired .
<en> Full harmonisation would mean just that , especially as far as the Nordic countries are concerned .
<en> Moreover , it would delay measures in those countries where things at present are hardly perfect .
<en> It is excellent that this proposal is being referred back to committee , because it contains certain slightly problematic points , particularly for small entrepreneurs .
<en> I would like the Committee to focus attention on one small issue .
<en> Amendments 18 and 107 suggest that this would have a very negative impact on travel companies in northern Finland , for example .
<en> Frequently a decision to go to a company , hotel or tourist accommodation is made on the road , and people call and book .
<en> Under this directive , that would not be enough : people would have to send a fax or something similar .
<en> This is not always possible in practice .
<en> This issue should be approached at the level of the public , and the different situations in the various Member States need to be understood .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I think the approach being taken to harmonise our fragmented European consumer law , which poses a barrier to trade , is a sound one and the right way to go .
<en> It is also important for consumers to be able to develop a sense of European law , in other words for it to be possible for them to be confident when they do business or when they buy or acquire something anywhere in the European Union .
<en> That will bring certainty not only for consumers , but also for producers .
<en> I am particularly pleased about the improvements in the information requirements for door-to-door selling and for distance contracts .
<en> In future debates - and I am therefore very pleased that this report has been referred back to committee once again - we should ensure that , when we talk about producers , we do not just consider the large corporations but also the small family businesses , and we should not overburden them with legal subtleties .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on a document which makes a significant contribution to the debate on the shape of the common agricultural policy .
<en> A key factor affecting the increase in economic potential of rural areas is the involvement of women - both in political bodies and agricultural organisations and by means of self-employment .
<en> A key issue in terms of job creation is the promotion among women of electronic forms of entrepreneurship such as e-commerce , which make it possible to be economically active even in inaccessible areas .
<en> We should also make better use of opportunities aimed at developing community life in rural areas by drafting and implementing programmes supporting training systems for women 's organisations .
<en> Something else which is of key significance in terms of equal opportunities is support for the putting in place of appropriate childcare infrastructure in rural areas , since properly functioning childcare makes it easier for women to return to work more quickly and makes them more competitive in the labour market .
<en> I would like to thank Mrs Jeggle once again for taking my proposals on board during her work on the report .
<en> Things which women asked for during public consultations I organised in the Ziemia Lubuska region were included in the document .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution on the efficiency and effectiveness of EU funding in the area of decommissioning nuclear power plants in the new Member States .
<2en> This is a very important document for Lithuania , Bulgaria and Slovakia as they decommission nuclear power plants .
<2en> There is concern that key waste infrastructure management projects have experienced delays in Lithuania and this is preventing it from absorbing EU funds in a timely and efficient manner .
<2en> It is noted that considerable financing is still required for decommissioning and that national funds are not sufficient to cover this : the State Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning Fund has so far accumulated just over EUR 100 million ( while the technical costs of decommissioning alone range from EUR 987 million to EUR 1 300 million ) .
<2en> The European Parliament therefore calls on the EU Member States to take appropriate measures in this respect .
<2en> The decommissioning of nuclear power plants is a very complicated process .
<2en> Countries do not have sufficient experience to be able to anticipate all the work involved and carry it out efficiently .
<2en> The European Parliament is adopting this resolution at the right time , thus encouraging Lithuania , Bulgaria , Slovakia and all EU Member States to implement decommissioning work as efficiently as possible .
<2en> This is very important work which will continue to receive much attention from the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this important document .
<en> When they joined the European Union , Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria made commitments that were politically and economically complex to decommission nuclear power plants , and the European Union made a commitment to allocate the financial assistance required for the decommissioning work , the construction of nuclear waste repositories , the storage of such waste and the development of energy projects .
<en> I believe that the concept of European Union solidarity can contribute effectively to mitigating the negative economic consequences of early closure in the energy sector , but many important issues remain unresolved .
<en> The issue of awards is not entirely clear , because it is now known that current funding will be insufficient to carry out the decommissioning work in a timely and proper manner .
<en> There is a danger that decommissioning the nuclear power plants will be delayed through lack of financial resources and this may pose a threat to the environment and human health .
<en> Detailed decommissioning plans have yet to be finalised , and , as a consequence , that there is insufficient information on the timetables , the costs of particular projects , and their sources of funding .
<en> I agree that the European Commission must play a greater coordinating role with these three Member States , in order to reach an agreement on the submission of detailed plans , the completion of work on schedule and the volume of funding .
<en> The Commission must also study ways of altering the EU 's methods of financing decommissioning operations in view of the strategies employed in the Member States and their national administrative structures , and simplifying the rules on management of the funds in such a way that they do not affect the safety and security of the decommissioning operations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for Mr Marinescu 's report because , in my view , a lack of funding for decommissioning measures will delay the process of providing financial assistance to the three Member States in question : Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria .
<en> A delay in this process would pose a threat to the environment and human health .
<en> In the future evaluations carried out by the European Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Union , the following aspects must be clarified : the allocation and use of funds by the EU for ensuring safe decommissioning , safe storage of nuclear waste and coordination between the three existing programmes .
<en> In this regard , the experience which has been accumulated must be used effectively and the model based on projects prepared and funded previously must be used in order to achieve a reduction in costs .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for our fellow Member 's report on providing the financial assistance requested by Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria for shutting down nuclear power plants .
<2en> It is glaringly obvious that if we do not provide suitable resources , we may face extremely serious consequences for the environment and human health .
<2en> The resources allocated must certainly be managed in a proper and transparent manner .
<2en> It is a serious concern that we do not have a single EU team of coordinators and experts for all three projects , which will supervise the drafting of a plan and clear timetable and the proper use of the funds already allocated , and decide what is required to complete the shutdown in safe conditions .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , a year ago in Haiti there was a feeling that the EU was slow off the mark in disaster and humanitarian relief .
<en> Are you satisfied by the degree of operational coordination between the EU and Member States in the recent emergencies , especially in Japan ?
<en> What has happened since the Commission communication of three years ago on reinforcing the Union 's disaster response capacity , which said that we needed greater coherence and effectiveness for a more integrated EU disaster response capacity ?
<en> In particular , has recent experience in Japan and a rather different one in North Africa helped to advance Commission thinking on whether we need an EU rapid reaction mechanism for humanitarian disaster and reconstruction aid ?
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - In the response to this crisis , I am proud that the Commission , represented by Kristalina Georgieva , who is here with us , was the first to send a high-level delegation to Japan after the terrible events there .
<en> I can assure you that Japan very much appreciated that gesture .
<en> We have provided both political and moral support to Japan : our system has been working in an efficient manner .
<en> In fact , the Japanese authorities were the first to ask us to coordinate the action of Member States because they preferred coordinated , rather than bilateral , support from the different Member States .
<en> Even if Japan is a very rich country which is very able to face these kinds of crises , as a matter of solidarity we are providing humanitarian aid of EUR 15 million .
<en> Of this , EUR 10 million comes from the European Union budget , arranged by the Commission , the remaining EUR 5 million or so comes from the Member States .
<en> We are basically satisfied with the coordination efforts in humanitarian terms , but it is certain that we can always improve if the Member States are ready to accept a coordinated and coherent approach with regard to civil protection and crisis response .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the March European Council confirmed the EU 's role as a promoter of the highest nuclear safety standards worldwide and in the EU neighbourhood .
<en> At least two new nuclear projects at the EU 's external border raise serious concern , owing to a lack of transparency and of consultation with the countries affected .
<en> New NPPs containing experimental reactors will be located in the Kaliningrad enclave in between two Member States and only 23 kilometres away from the eastern EU border in Belarus .
<en> The EU , in cooperation with the relevant international bodies , should ensure that the developers comply with the highest nuclear safety and environmental standards right from the beginning of the development stage and should allow international nuclear experts to assess both projects , especially the site selection criteria .
<en> The EU could effectively prevent unsafe nuclear development by refusing to contract energy that will be produced in unclean nuclear power plant stations .
<en> What role does the Commission see in preventing unsafe nuclear development at the EU 's external borders ?
<en> What measures could it take ?
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - A good example I can give you is that of our working relations with Ukraine .
<en> I will attend the Nuclear Safety Summit in Kiev on 19 April 2011 , organised by the Ukrainian Government , and I will be there together with the UN Secretary-General , Ban Ki-moon .
<en> In fact , we have been one of the most important donors - if not the most important - to Chernobyl so that it can be fully repaired .
<en> As the European Council stated in its conclusions , the priority of ensuring the safety of nuclear plants obviously cannot cease to apply at our borders .
<en> The European Union will request that similar stress tests be carried out in the neighbouring countries and worldwide , at both existing and planned nuclear plants and , in this regard , full use should be made of the relevant international organisations .
<en> So , certainly , we are going to accord very high priority to nuclear safety in our relations with third countries , including some that you have mentioned .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , the crisis in Japan has given further meaning to our collective commitment to creating a 202020 Strategy .
<en> However , we continue to wait , whether on 202020 or on the 2020 Strategy , for there to be worthwhile and robust instruments that will pull Europe out of the situation we are experiencing , out of the recessive measures , unemployment and insufficient growth , and out of the uncontrolled problem of sovereign debt .
<en> Is it not time for Europe to move forward with new European sources of financing , and to implement effective growth and cohesion measures based on another approach to the energy problem and to the problem of sustainable growth ?
<en> That is my question .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , earlier today I spoke in this Chamber about my constituency , the West Midlands , and the economic hardships it is going through .
<en> One of the last things that people there want is more money to be spent on politicians - they already have too many politicians , including MEPs , wasting their money as it is .
<en> What this is , is a step , and Europe is willing to throw this money at creating that further step on the road to a super state .
<en> It has its Parliament , its President and its Foreign Affairs Adviser , and now it wants the political parties to go with that .
<en> Because what it wants is a nation called the European Union .
<en> Even the most euro-sceptic members of this Parliament are willing to trade their principles to take their money .
<en> Well done !
<en> Is that what Europe wants ?
<en> Does it want to buy its way to power ?
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , in our democracies we have our parliaments , which are the voice of citizens , then we have the political parties and their foundations , which are the masterminds , think-tanks and leaders of the debate .
<en> Parliaments are the motors of democracy and political parties are the fuel .
<en> Here in our Parliament , we complain all the time about citizens ' disinterest in the European Union .
<en> We lament the abstention rate in European elections and ' No ' votes in referendums .
<en> If we want real European democracy , we must take a serious look at the place we want to give to European political parties in the European space we are trying to build .
<en> We have already done a good deal with the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Citizens ' Initiative .
<en> We must now give European political parties the resources they need to achieve their ambitions .
<en> Please note that I do not think these resources should be a vehicle for allowing the big parties to turn into immovable hegemonies .
<en> Small organisations should also be able to take part in the debate .
<en> This is important if we are to combat the parties ' negative image among citizens and their image as the unpopular face of democracy .
<en> I believe it is essential to clearly establish the conditions on funding and transparent management of funding if we are to strengthen the European public space we are trying to create .
<en> The initiative must be inclusive , so that the larger parties are not favoured to the detriment of the smaller parties and vice versa .
<en> Another point I would like to deal with relates to the continuity we will be creating between the European , national and regional levels .
<en> The European regulations we will be introducing must be capable of fitting in with the different national legal frameworks on the subject , to ensure that the different levels do indeed mesh with each other .
<en> Finally , we also need to look very closely at what paragraph 23 of the report says , because by extension we need to think about the links that European parties would be able to form with parties in the rest of the world .
<en> We must be able to share our democratic values with our partners in the rest of the world , because the globalised world in which we live today requires political decision-makers to come up with solutions to problems together .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) Mr President , the importance of the role played by European political parties is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon , which aims to create an effective European political space .
<en> It is the job of our politicians ' to encourage citizens to take an interest in the European Union , to make it more understandable and accessible and to involve them in decision making .
<en> However , to that end it is necessary to regulate the activities of European political parties and foundations in a clear and uniform manner , and to ensure that the internal functioning of such parties is democratic .
<en> As enablers for democracy these political parties must have a uniform legal and fiscal status , which would ensure that European citizens have a better understanding of political parties and are better represented .
<en> It is particularly important for the formation of political parties ' internal management bodies to be based on transparent principles , in order to ensure the democratic election of all party bodies and democratic decision-making processes .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , very few of our citizens are aware of the existence of European parties and foundations .
<en> Until now these have simply been umbrella organisations for their national member parties , established according to national laws , mainly Belgian laws in this case .
<en> What is it that these European parties do ?
<en> They discuss European issues , hold party conferences and play an indispensable role in reforming the European Parliament 's electoral system .
<en> According to the Treaty of Lisbon , they are required to help establish European democracy - a political forum at European level .
<en> The own-initiative report to be voted on tomorrow calls on the Commission to reform the legal basis for these European parties .
<en> In future , these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality .
<en> As liberals , we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding , as there was a certain greed in evidence .
<en> It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings , something that cannot be taken for granted .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the tide of opinion is moving one way in many of our nations , but the European Union and this Parliament curiously seek to swim in a different direction .
<en> There is no demand from our citizens for transnational politicians .
<en> This Parliament now wants to spend even more public money , when our national governments are having to make reductions in public expenditure .
<en> I speak , Mr President , in my capacity as President of New Direction , the Foundation for European Reform .
<en> To my mind , it is unacceptable that the costs of political foundations should be increasing at a rate of over 30 % year on year .
<en> In 2009 , EUR 6.3 million was spent ; by 2012 this will have doubled to EUR 12.3 million .
<en> Some might say that if you object to this , why does your Foundation accept funding ?
<en> Well , the answer to that is quite simply that any funds we do not accept are distributed among the foundations of the other political groups ; we would be funding the activities of our political opponents .
<en> We need to find a way of returning money to our national exchequers .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this debate tonight is symptomatic of all that is wrong with the ' more Europe ' agenda .
<en> It is simply staggering for me to have listened and to see how greatly removed the debate is from the agenda of ordinary citizens .
<en> Mr Duff quite rightly acknowledges that there is a gap to fill between the European powers and the individual citizens .
<en> That is absolutely right , but that gap will not be filled by developing European parties and , as another contributor to the debate has said , giving those parties the resources to match their ambitions .
<en> I would challenge Mr Duff to go to his constituency at the weekend and try to sell those views to local community groups that have had their funding cut because of austerity measures imposed by his coalition government in the United Kingdom .
<en> The gap will be filled , however , by giving people their say on Lisbon , on increasing federalism , and on the litany of red tape that comes from these institutions .

<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , I start my concluding remarks by thanking once again Mrs Giannakou for her report because I think that this debate has very clearly proven that the concern and the issues she raised in her report are legitimate ; they are at the heart of European integration and of its democratic nature .
<en> The exchange of views clearly demonstrated as well how sensitive these issues are and , therefore , if this House approves this proposed legislative resolution tomorrow , the Commission will respect its commitment stemming from the framework agreement and will respond to this resolution within three months .
<en> However , as you may have felt from this debate , it is quite clear that this would be a very sensitive , elaborate , political and legal task because there are a lot of issues that are both legally and politically very sensitive .
<en> Our preliminary analyses on the statute of the European political parties is in this direction but , of course , we now need to study very carefully the legal basis , potential legal form and , as we see now , we would most probably need a separate legal act on this issue .
<en> That is because the revising of the regulation from 2003-2004 would simply not be sufficient because it targeted the funding issue and not the issue of the statute of the political groups .
<en> So this would be one angle , which we would have to look at very carefully .
<en> Several speakers raised the question of amending the Financial Regulation .
<en> Here , again , we would need to look very carefully at the requirements , scope and the timing and we certainly took very careful note of the calls in this report for more flexibility .
<en> As you know , we already took some steps in 2007 and we will examine these proposals very carefully .
<en> However , it is quite clear that it might be very difficult to agree on the changes and have them incorporated into the current revision of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules .
<en> Of course , Parliament is a legislator and is free to raise this issue in the current ongoing interinstitutional process , if it so wishes .
<en> My thanks again , Mr President , and we are certainly looking forward to the ensuing debate on this issue once the resolution has been adopted and the Commission 's response has been prepared .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner in particular for what he said and for the undertakings he made and my fellow members who supported this report .
<2en> Firstly , I think that it is important to repeat that , as far as the funding procedure is concerned , the parties will not seek more funding and that the amendment to the 2007 regulation has brought about greater transparency , as Transparency International itself has admitted .
<2en> Secondly , it is only fair that the parties should seek a European statute and to bring their statute into line with the European institutions and with European legislation and this is , of course , intended to satisfy the citizens .
<2en> Finally , creating a secure and transparent environment for the operation and funding of parties is a deeply democratic act .
<2en> We need a European area of active political parties which will bring citizens into the heart of the Union and help them in their daily lives .
<2en> This will mean greater participation , more democracy and , in the final analysis , more Europe .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on 6 April at 12 : 00 .
<en> Written Statements ( Rule 149 )
<sp>
<2en> The European Union has faced repeated criticism due to the lack of democracy .
<2en> To achieve genuine democracy , we need to have a European political space in the true sense of the term , and political parties at European level are a key instrument for attaining this goal .
<2en> The proposals for reforming the regulation on the rules governing European political parties and their funding , which feature in this report , mark a step towards streamlining how they operate .
<2en> I think that they can fulfil their role much better if they enjoy a uniform political and legal status based on European law .
<2en> The current system where these parties have a legal personality based on national legislation does not offer the conditions which are most conducive to ensuring effective communication between these parties and the electorate in the 27 Member States .
<2en> Introducing a European statute would help political parties at European level to adapt to any reform of the electoral system for the European elections , which is currently under discussion .
<2en> Furthermore , I welcome the move to facilitate the involvement of European political parties in campaigns for referendums relating to European issues at Member State level .
<2en> In most cases , these referendums are dominated by purely domestic issues .
<2en> The involvement of European parties could help redirect the debates towards the real issues of these referendums .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) Discussions about how to strengthen the role of European political parties by developing democracy in Europe and forming public opinion are very relevant .
<en> Although Parliament is acquiring increasing powers there has been no reduction in its democratic deficit due to citizens ' ever declining participation in European Parliament elections .
<en> Political parties at European level are essential instruments of parliamentary democracy , raising European political awareness , promoting interest in EU affairs and expressing the will of the citizens of the European Union .
<en> I therefore agree entirely with the rapporteur that it is necessary to enhance the situation of political parties at European level and prepare a clear and uniform legal status and financing model for them .
<en> Such parties should not remain foreign bodies .
<en> Currently the role of European political parties in the public sphere is rather limited .
<en> They are merely umbrella organisations for national parties and not directly in touch with the electorate .
<en> The new legal status of such parties in the European Union would ensure organisational uniformity and provide the opportunity to carry out its role more effectively .
<en> I would like to stress that we must continue to strive for the creation of a safe and transparent environment for party funding .
<en> Party funding should not be based purely on grants , we must also promote funding from our own resources , which are a sign of party vitality .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SK ) I would not like to be a member of a political party established on the principles sketched out in the submitted report .
<en> These parties are supposed to become the representatives of the ' European public interest ' , but if you ask any two Members of this Parliament what that is , they will each answer differently .
<en> Who will determine this interest ?
<en> Parliament ?
<en> The Commission ?
<en> Members are not nominated by EU institutions , however , but elected by the citizens of the Member States .
<en> It is my duty to represent actual citizens , not what the EU institutions consider to be the ' European public interest ' .
<en> Nor do I agree that European parties should also operate at regional and national levels .
<en> They simply do not have a mandate for that .
<en> If they start doing that , they will get into conflict with the parties on whose ballots we were all elected , and with the voters represented by these parties .
<en> My loyalty belongs to my voters , not to a European political party .
<en> That is called a free mandate .
<en> I therefore completely disagree with the philosophy of super parties presented in this report .
<en> It is another attempt by the social euro-engineers , who are so obsessed with the utopian super-state that they ignore common sense .
<en> If they listened to common sense , they would realise that the stubborn assertion of such proposals demolishes the foundations on which European integration stands .
<en> As a staunch European , I must therefore vote against this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Natural disasters are no longer a rarity in Europe .
<2en> The most recent events , such as the floods in 2010 in Poland , Slovakia , Romania , the Czech Republic and Hungary , show that the Solidarity Fund is essential .
<2en> This fund is not used to compensate private individuals for damage to property , but primarily to rebuild infrastructure .
<2en> Therefore , it can be regarded as an appropriate refinancing instrument .
<2en> In particular , in countries such as Poland , Slovakia , Hungary and Romania , there have been large-scale disasters and the direct damages exceed the usual threshold of 0.6 % of Gross National Income .
<2en> For this reason , I have voted in favour of this proposal .
<sp>
<2en> This report refers to Draft amending budget No 1 / 2011 to the general budget for 2011 , the aim of which is to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to the sum of EUR 182.4 million in commitment and payment appropriations in order to mitigate the effects of flooding resulting from heavy rainfall in Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania .
<2en> The only purpose of Draft amending budget No 1 / 2011 is to formally incorporate this budgetary amendment into the budget for 2011 .
<2en> The reasons given fully justify this amending budget , and I therefore voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this Draft amending budget , the aim of which is to respond to the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to the sum of EUR 182.4 million in commitment and payment appropriations in order to mitigate the effects of flooding resulting from heavy rainfall in Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Croatia and Romania .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We have abstained .
<en> The report concerns a transfer in payments for mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund for floods in 2011 in Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Romania .
<en> We agree with the urgent need to mobilise the funds , but not with the proposed financing method ( via a ' negative reserve ' ) .
<sp>
<2en> I am in favour of this report , which aims to provide EU aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund for Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Romania , following the flooding in May and June 2010 that affected these areas and their populations .
<2en> The EU must continue to be an organisation that shows solidarity .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This proposal sets out general rules for EU-Greenland trade in , inter alia , fishery products , live bivalve molluscs , echinoderms , tunicates , marine gastropods and their by-products .
<2en> The Member States should authorise the importing of products originating in Greenland , in line with Union legislation on internal trade .
<2en> The importing of products to the Union will be subject to a number of conditions , including the effective transposition and application of applicable rules established in Union legislation regarding animal health and food safety .
<2en> Like the rapporteur , I believe that the proposed text should be adopted using the ordinary legislative procedure , and that Parliament should exercise its legislative rights in similar cases in the future .
<sp>
<2en> Exports of fishery products from Greenland represent around 82 % of its total exports , totalling EUR 255 million in 2007 .
<2en> The majority - 87 % - were directed to the EU , notably to Denmark , at 97 % .
<2en> The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted unanimously an opinion supporting the request that Articles 43 ( 2 ) and 204 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) and the Sole Article of the Protocol ( No 34 ) on Special Arrangements for Greenland must form the legal basis for the proposed legislative text , instead of the legal basis chosen by the Commission : that is , Article 203 of the TFEU .
<2en> Therefore , given that it is a legal issue that is in question and not the content of the proposal for a resolution , and given the consensus obtained , I agree with its adoption .
<sp>
<2en> The great debate surrounding this report is a side issue to its motivation .
<2en> Specifically , the European Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries expressed its disagreement with the legal basis chosen by the Commission for tabling this proposal : Article 203 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) , which provides for the Council examining ' provisions as regards the detailed rules and the procedure for the association of the countries and territories with the Union ' after consulting the European Parliament .
<2en> The Committee on Fisheries believed that Articles 43 ( 2 ) - referring to the ordinary legislative procedure , or colegislation - and 204 of the TFEU should be adopted as its legal basis , along with the Sole Article of the Protocol ( No 34 ) on Special Arrangements for Greenland .
<2en> This position was supported by the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs .
<2en> The important issue that should , at its base , constitute the substance of the report remains on its margins : the defining of rules applicable to imports of fishery products from Greenland to the EU .
<2en> Key fisheries exports from Greenland include prawn ( 59 % ) , Greenland halibut ( 23 % ) , cod ( 9.5 % ) , crabs ( 1.9 % ) , scallops ( 1.4 % ) and spawn ( 1.3 % ) .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of Ms Fraga 's report , which allows Greenland to export fishery products to the EU despite not being a member .
<en> When Greenland won significant home-rule and decided to opt out of the EC , they had to negotiate their exit .
<en> This precedent gives the lie to false claims that internal enlargement of the EU would require newly independent EU states to reapply for membership .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a Council decision laying down rules for imports into the European Union from Greenland of fishery products , live bivalve molluscs , echinoderms , tunicates , marine gastropods and by-products thereof .
<2en> Greenland 's exports of fishery products , approximately 82 % of its total exports , totalled EUR 255 million in 2007 , the largest part of which ( 87 % ) were directed to the EU , notably ( 97 % ) to Denmark .
<2en> Key fisheries exports from Greenland include prawn ( 59 % ) , Greenland halibut ( 23 % ) , cod ( 9.5 % ) , crabs ( 1.9 % ) , scallops ( 1.4 % ) and spawn ( 1.3 % ) .
<2en> This decision includes an amendment to the legal framework , from a Council decision to a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Work on the creation of a common European asylum system started immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999 .
<2en> In December 2005 , with the objective of harmonising the Member States ' legal procedures , Council Directive 2005 / 85 / EC on asylum procedures was adopted , laying down the rules for granting and withdrawing ' refugee status ' .
<2en> The recent social and political upheaval in a number of countries , specifically in North Africa and the Middle East , have brought issues relating to asylum applications in the European Union onto the agenda .
<2en> In truth , when refugees cross a border , they should not be persecuted or received with mistrust .
<2en> I therefore welcome the adoption of this proposal , which has ended up with a Manichaean interpretation of this problem , acknowledging that the right to asylum is a fundamental right and must be treated fairly and equitably by the Member States .
<2en> I welcome the rapporteur 's proposals which aim to develop a legal aid system , given that these are vulnerable people who lack effective guarantees ; to improve procedures ; and to improve procedures and give applicants better rights , minors in particular .
<sp>
<2en> The proposal for a directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing international protection follows the same lines as the creation of a common European asylum system .
<2en> Nevertheless , it should be understood that the progress of this legal ' harmonisation ' goes hand-in-hand with overall foreign policy followed by the European Union , and its hypocritical positions on immigration and aid for refugees .
<2en> The situation in Lampedusa , where there are thousands of refugees without adequate protection , is a clear demonstration of this , not to mention the hundreds or thousands who have been dying in boats crossing the Mediterranean , as has just happened again , disgracefully .
<2en> We are extremely concerned with the scale of the current problem , especially given what is happening in the serious armed conflicts , in Libya in particular .
<2en> We would also stress the fact that this proposal for a directive includes aspects that will end up restricting the right to asylum and applying conditions to it , above all , limiting each Member State 's sovereign right to make its own choices and decide on its own asylum procedures .
<sp>
<2en> The proposal for a directive being voted on in the European Parliament today on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing international protection follows the same lines as the creation of a common European asylum system .
<2en> Nevertheless , it should be understood that the progress of this legal ' harmonisation ' goes hand-in-hand with overall foreign policy followed by the European Union , and its hypocritical positions on immigration and aid for refugees , such as the situation in Lampedusa , where there are thousands of refugees without adequate protection , not to mention the hundreds or thousands who have been dying in boats crossing the Mediterranean .
<2en> We are extremely concerned with the scale of the current problem , especially given what is happening in the serious armed conflicts , in Libya in particular .
<2en> We would also stress the fact that this proposal for a directive includes aspects that will end up restricting access to the right to asylum and applying conditions to it , above all , as regards each Member State 's sovereign right to make its own choices and decide on its own asylum procedures .
<2en> Hence , our critical position as regards this report .
<sp>
<2en> International protection is supposed to enable people who are truly persecuted in their own country to seek refuge under better circumstances .
<2en> However , as it is , and although some amendments have helped to improve it , the report by Mrs Guillaume is a real incentive for people to abuse this process , clogging up the relevant services and depriving those who really need their case to be reviewed quickly .
<2en> Minors , whatever their age or true circumstances , benefit from total goodwill that is entirely unjustified ; there are limited opportunities to use the accelerated procedure in order to reject manifestly unfounded applications ; appeals are systematically of a suspensive nature ; the request for a review of negative decisions has become a right ; and the necessary cooperation of the applicant for protection is hardly ever required , even when it is a matter of proving his or her identity and origin , which is nonetheless the minimum requirement for reviewing the case .
<2en> Applications for international protection cannot and should not be a means of circumventing restrictive measures against unwanted economic migration .
<2en> It is disgraceful that Parliament lends a hand to this kind of circumvention by granting inordinate rights to false asylum seekers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - With reference to the Guillaume report , although , in principle , this represents a significant step towards the realisation of a common asylum policy system for Europe , I voted against the group on a number of clauses as I felt that they did not reflect realistically the complexities and problems faced by my country , Malta , which is a regular recipient of migrants .
<en> Having said that , however , when it came to the final vote , I voted in favour of the whole report which ultimately contained a number of very good clauses addressing Member States ' needs and preoccupations .
<en> One example is the call for the immediate mobilisation of financial , administrative and technical support for Member States receiving disproportionately large numbers of asylum applications .
<en> Such an initiative is essential for all Member States , but especially so for countries like Malta - often burdened with responsibilities and complexities , due to the reception of large inflows of migrants , which it cannot shoulder on its own .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this proposal , which is a very worthy one , as it concerns whether we should fund parties using taxpayers ' money .
<en> In a case such as this , there obviously need to be clear rules that are the same for everyone .
<en> In my opinion , the parties must also have their own system of fund raising , even if it is on a small scale .
<en> In Amendment 2 , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament suggested that this share of selffunding should be just 5 % .
<en> I think that it should be at least 10 % .
<en> That is a very small amount when we consider that this is a matter of taxpayers ' money , and we should be very meticulous in these matters .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the Giannakou report paves the way to fulfilment of the provisions of Article 10 ( 4 ) of the Treaty on European Union and Article 244 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
<en> Parliament and the Council should work together to define the status of a party at European level and their foundations , and should establish rules for funding both parties and foundations .
<en> However , it is necessary to call attention to the provisions of paragraphs 10 and 11 of the report , which concern the future of transnational lists in elections to Parliament .
<en> It is , admittedly , only a proposal for the future , but at the present time , it does not have the approval of the citizens .
<en> This concerns , in particular , Member States which have had experience of national lists and have abolished them .
<en> Another important matter is the timing of these proposals - the crisis and the proposed savings are also a cause of reluctance to increasing the size of European institutions .
<en> From our point of view , I think a more important matter is the possibility of increasing the size of the European Parliament in connection with enlargement of the European Union by the accession of new Member States rather than the possibility of increasing its size on the basis of new lists .
<sp>
<en> ( DA ) Mr President , I , too , would like to see clear rules for the European parties , but I must essentially question what the point of the European parties actually is .
<en> The report states that they will create a greater understanding among European citizens for the EU 's institutions and cooperation across borders .
<en> However , what we actually see is that , as the European parties grow larger , as more money is continually used both within the parties and in the funds and all manner of other institutions relating to these , in line with these things , the European people 's support for and understanding of the EU 's institutions falls .
<en> The latest Eurobarometer survey showed support for the EU among the European people to be at an all-time low , so this is not working .
<en> I would therefore ask the fundamental question of whether there really is any point continuing to waste billions of euro on these European parties .
<en> I do not believe that there is , and therefore I voted against this report .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted against this report .
<en> You can keep your 30 pieces of silver .
<en> I will not be joining any pan-European party .
<en> I will not be selling out my principles as some in this Chamber are willing to do .
<en> It is not fair that the public , once again , have to use their resources to fund politicians .
<en> Politicians should be privately funded through donations , etc . , and that should be heavily regulated .
<en> This Chamber found out only recently how politicians do need to be regulated , but the funding of political parties for a European ideal can never be right .
<en> I will never join a pan-European party .
<en> I will stand up for my principles and to hell with the lot of you .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have voted on three own-initiative reports on the Single Market Act , which is an important mechanism for growth in the European economy , and obviously for the creation of jobs , with concrete and direct results both for European citizens and for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> There are many proposals made by the European Commission which tend towards the integration and liberalisation of European markets , resulting in measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular , to have an effect on innovation and the protection of creativity , improving the efficiency and sustainability of both material and non-material networks and infrastructure .
<en> I hope that we will confront some obstacles in this structural context of support to small and medium-sized enterprises , such as the diversity of national laws , including rules and tax systems that fragment the market resulting in higher compliance costs for businesses to shoulder .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The aim of the resolution on the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) is to recommend that the next strategic review of the ENP strengthens the differentiation between states based on their respective ambition and commitments , when followed by real progress and concrete steps .
<2en> The specificities of each partner should be taken into consideration , including its goals and potential .
<2en> Fundamental European values , including democracy , rule of law and respect for human rights and basic freedoms , the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption are the basis upon which the ENP was established , and these should be the main measure for evaluating the role of the eastern partners .
<2en> Freedom of the press and the fight against corruption should be a priority for the EU when building relations with these countries , and this should be reflected in the overall framework for institutional development .
<sp>
<2en> The EU 's goals are very broad and are based on an extension to neighbouring countries in order to create a large area for the free movement of people and goods .
<2en> In these circumstances , the EU 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) has a vital role in its strategy for development and growth .
<2en> Several instruments and resolutions have been adopted to this end , particularly the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument ( ENPI ) and the crucial choices of the common foreign and security policy .
<2en> I am therefore pleased with the adoption of this report and the proposed measures , particularly the strengthening of funding and cooperation from various sectors , along with the holding of a second summit of the Eastern Partnership during the second half of 2011 .
<2en> I would like to point out the need for the EU to step up its dialogue with civil society organisations in these countries , fostering free trade and promoting stability , encouraging the sharing of experience and mobility between the Member States and those countries , and promoting multilateral dialogue .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution , because the review of the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy includes such fundamental goals as democracy , the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , a market economy , sustainable development and good governance .
<2en> It stresses that the ENP is still a framework of strategic importance for deepening and strengthening relations with our closest partners so as to support their political , social and economic reforms , and underlines the importance of maintaining the principle of joint ownership in the design and implementation of programmes and actions .
<2en> The Eastern Partnership has been launched as a political framework for the advancement of the Eastern Dimension of the ENP , which seeks to deepen and strengthen the relations between the EU and its eastern neighbours , furthering political association , economic integration and legislative approximation , while supporting political and socio-economic reforms in the partner countries .
<2en> I would like to stress that economic reforms must go hand in hand with political reforms and that good governance can only be achieved through an open and transparent decision-making process based on democratic institutions .
<2en> It is particularly important to foster further regional cooperation in the Black Sea space and enhance EU policies towards the Black Sea region , in particular , by launching a fully-fledged EU strategy for the Black Sea and ensuring that there are the necessary financial and human resources for its effective implementation .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I have always encouraged the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union and this can be seen from my previous activities .
<en> I endorse the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy , mainly because it is needed to make a substantial contribution to ensuring that human rights and political principles are more strongly integrated into the analysis of the political situation in third countries .
<en> It underlines the positive developments concerning human rights and democratisation in some partner countries and some negative developments in others , particularly in Belarus .
<en> I also found important the fact that it pays particular attention to the mobility of students , academics , researchers and businessmen by ensuring that sufficient resources are available and by strengthening existing scholarship programmes .
<en> For all these reasons , I support the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
<sp>
<2en> The review of the neighbourhood policy must continue to resolve the specific problems which the regions located at the European Union 's border have to face .
<2en> I think that significant administrative capacity is required to be able to tackle such diverse problems .
<2en> Apart from the demographic challenges , climate change , economic competitiveness and quality of life , the regions which share borders with non-Member States have to deal with a series of consequences resulting from problems which are not being resolved properly .
<2en> This is the case with the way in which natural disasters are managed , for instance .
<2en> Interventions in emergency situations are extremely difficult if the neighbouring countries do not have the capacity to respond , and no region can respond to the whole situation on its own .
<2en> This is why I have proposed that the regions located at the EU border , which have borders with at least two non-EU states , should be regarded as ' platform ' regions and supported accordingly .
<2en> The neighbourhood policy needs to take into account the capacity of the regions located within the EU , but which have external borders , to tackle the problems which are much more complex .
<2en> Commensurate financial support must be provided for this .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Once again , I voted in favour of this report which points out that real savings could be made if Parliament only had one workplace , in the same city as the European Union 's other institutions ( in other words Brussels ) .
<2en> The report of the Secretary-General on Parliament 's preliminary draft estimates for 2011 itself draws attention to the huge annual costs arising from the geographical split of Parliament , estimated at some EUR 160 000 000 , which accounts for 9 % of Parliament 's total budget .
<2en> It is true that at present the decision to change this situation , and in doing so to make some EUR 160 000 000 of savings per year , whilst at the same time considerably lessening Parliament 's carbon footprint , lies solely with the Council .
<2en> However through this vote , I call upon Parliament 's President and the Members who are negotiating the Union budget on behalf of Parliament to suggest to the Council that it take steps to ensure that the Union can make these savings .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the report on discharge of the European Parliament budget 2009 , since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions .
<2en> I believe that it would be useful to review the European Parliament budget in the long term , in order to reduce costs and create resources for the efficient functioning of the Parliament in the context of its increased competences arising from the Treaty of Lisbon .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I would like to emphasise that , as a public institution , the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible .
<en> I also believe , particularly in view of the current economic situation , that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency .
<en> Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues , which is why I would like to provide more room for the discharge debate .
<en> I also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel .
<en> Finally , I do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes .
<en> However , I am highly critical of Parliament 's Prize for Journalism , and I do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament .
<en> I therefore believe that this prize should be abolished .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - On the discharge Report of the European Parliament for 2009 , I voted in line with my political Group against paragraph 143 on airmiles .
<en> The same concept is already covered by paragraph 199 on which I voted in favour .
<en> Paragraph 119 is more comprehensive and more practical for implementation purposes .
<sp>
<2en> We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to grant discharge to the European Parliament for the financial year 2009 .
<2en> We would like to emphasise that , as a public institution , the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible .
<2en> We therefore chose to support paragraph 5 , which calls for greater transparency with regard to Members ' expenditure allowance .
<2en> We also believe , particularly in view of the current economic situation , that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency .
<2en> Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues , which is why we would also like to provide more room for the discharge debate .
<2en> We also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel , even though we find it difficult to see how this could be implemented in practice .
<2en> Finally , we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes .
<2en> However , we are highly critical of Parliament 's Prize for Journalism , and do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament .
<2en> We therefore believe that this prize should be abolished .

<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , open borders are an important symbol for Europe .
<en> I would like to draw your attention to another problem .
<en> I come from Northern Germany , which is why the German-Danish border is of particular importance for me .
<en> The right-wing populist Danish People 's Party is trying to force the Danish Government to reintroduce border controls .
<en> What is the reason for this ?
<en> It is a fear of people from Romania and Bulgaria .
<en> This is scandalous .
<en> The right-wing populists are rapidly growing in numbers and represent a real danger for Europe .
<en> Of course we must have protections against untrammelled criminality and our security authorities have already found effective alternatives to passport controls .
<en> It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk .
<en> The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high-level attack .
<en> I would call on the Danish Government not to allow itself to be dictated to by the right-wing populists .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , freedom of movement is a cornerstone of European integration .
<en> Let us not open a Pandora 's Box by revising Schengen .
<en> Let us not go back on our principles .
<en> The possibility of introducing border controls already exists .
<en> It should be temporary , exceptional and a last resort .
<en> What is needed is a common approach , a long-term vision as called for by the Commission , to respond to citizens ' concerns on security .
<en> We need to move forward to a common asylum policy by 2012 , to have a common migration policy and to facilitate legal immigration for work while combating irregular immigration .
<en> Short-term procedures that hinder resettlement have to be removed .
<en> Yes , we have to express solidarity with the Member States that are most exposed to an influx of people , but first of all our solidarity should be with the people who are fleeing tragedy .
<en> The dignity of immigrants , of people fleeing the country , has to be put back at the centre of the European debate .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , I wonder if the demagogues of Rome and Paris and their cohorts here in the European Parliament realise what their request to reinstate internal border controls actually implies .
<en> More than one million European citizens work in countries other than their own .
<en> One hundred and fifty thousand people cross the border every day into Luxembourg .
<en> Do you want to subject them to border checks ?
<en> Tens of millions of Europeans will travel this summer .
<en> Do Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy want to subject them to border checks ?
<en> President Barroso said it himself : every year there are over 1.25 billion movements of persons within the Schengen area .
<en> Do you want to subject them to border checks ?
<en> Commissioner Malmström , leave Schengen as it is .
<en> Re-read the Treaties , re-read Articles 67 and 78 .
<en> Everything is there .
<en> There is no need to devise something new ; let us stick with Schengen and the free movement of citizens , otherwise we will have a citizens ' revolt on our hands .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , Mr Schulz has left us , but I am pleased that he and Mrs Rodust have made it clear that it was not Social Democrat policy that border controls should be reintroduced .
<en> However , two years ago , during the election campaign for the European Parliament , the key demand of the Danish Social Democrats was that the borders should be closed again .
<en> I am not talking about the right-wing populists .
<en> Mr Jørgensen and party leader Mrs Thorning-Schmidt both argued for this .
<en> You are absolutely right , this is populism .
<en> An important question for the Commission is therefore as follows : Can a country reintroduce border controls and still remain in the Schengen Union with access to the information system , etc . , or is this an either-or situation ?
<en> The question is important for the Danish debate , which is why I ask that a clear answer be given .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I note that , in order to save Schengen , many would like to offer as a solution the expulsion from Europe of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sarkozy .
<en> More simply , I think it would be enough to strengthen Frontex , which means tightening security along the EU external borders .
<en> I would like to remind everyone that right now many governments shun their duty of solidarity by not taking part in Frontex .
<en> Besides that , I feel compelled to make another crucial point : behind the humanitarian emergency and the immigration problem lurks a political problem .
<en> Indeed , while Europe has a strong humanitarian presence on immigration , I agree with Mrs Malmström that it is absent , at a political level , with regard to the tragedy behind it .
<en> More Mrs Malmström and less Baroness Ashton is what we need , and we will see that somehow we can improve the difficult conditions in which we find ourselves and will be able to ensure that the future is given a chance .

<en> ( FI ) Madam President , the events in North Africa have once again shown that the EU 's common foreign policy is behind the times and ineffective .
<en> The EU 's calls for a respect for human rights and democracy mainly look like a delusional Don Quixote in rusty armour battling with windmills , when compared to the lucrative arms trade engaged in by the Member States of the EU .
<en> Seven of the world 's ten biggest sellers of weapons are EU countries , EU Member States , and weapons have been sold to Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , Bahrain and Yemen .
<en> Baroness Ashton , might it be time to make a ban on the export of weapons a priority for EU foreign policy ?
<en> The coordination of 27 different foreign and security policies is not the easiest of tasks , and you cannot blame the captain alone for the shipwreck .
<en> Member States have a right to their own foreign policy .
<en> We could , however , expect one or two things from the skipper , namely , initiative and ideas , and we are still waiting .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , following the appalling massacre in Camp Ashraf on 8 April , the situation there remains critical .
<en> Another bloody attack could take place at any moment .
<en> I have just returned from Baghdad , where I led a small delegation of MEPs in high-level talks with the President of Iraq and senior government ministers .
<en> I have now brokered a solution to the Ashraf crisis , which you have seen , Baroness Ashton .
<en> It requires the involvement of the UN , the US and the EU and needs your active encouragement to achieve the resettlement of the 3 400 refugees from Ashraf to the US , Canada , Australia , Norway , Switzerland and the EU Member States , or wherever they have family or other connections .
<en> This is the only option that can avoid another humanitarian catastrophe , and it has been agreed by the people of Ashraf themselves .
<en> The European Parliament relies on you to seize this opportunity to save innocent lives and avoid further violence and bloodshed .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , Europe Day this week was supposed to be a celebration of European national identity .
<en> It is not .
<en> It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government , meaning above nation states .
<en> This is in contrast to intergovernmental , where nation states freely cooperate , but do not cede powers to a higher central authority .
<en> The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference .
<en> The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain , France and the United States , whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons .
<en> The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation .
<en> In contrast , the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron 's proposal for a no-fly zone .
<en> It is ironic that the Red Baroness herself , Cathy Ashton , stood against this no-fly proposal , her aide reportedly calling it ' headline grabbing desperation ' .
<en> The lesson of this is that principal nations act intergovernmentally while supranational bodies merely fiddle as Libya burns .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , High Representative , ladies and gentlemen , your job , Baroness Ashton , is a very difficult one and you carry a heavy burden on your shoulders .
<en> I hope you will take my questions not as provocation but as an aid to reflection .
<en> Baroness Ashton , at the end of our joint debate , we shall vote on the report on the European Union 's role in multilateral organisations .
<en> Two years ago , at the hearing that preceded your taking office , I asked you what your position was on the European Union having a single seat in the United Nations .
<en> You replied on that occasion that you had not had time to think about it .
<en> The Muñiz de Urquiza report contains the Millán Mon amendment defining Parliament 's position on the issue .
<en> What is yours today ?
<en> Have you had time to think about it over the last two years ?
<en> Baroness Ashton , 17 May is Europe-Iraq Day in Baghdad .
<en> The EU presence in Iraq consists of two officials and one ambassador .
<en> These three people operate in the British compound .
<en> You would rightly like to find the resources to resolve the situation .
<en> To help you , I would point out that there are seven EU officials in the Bahamas .
<en> What happens that is so infinitely more decisive for the fate of the European Union in the Bahamas compared with Baghdad ?
<en> Would it not be better to have 17 officials in Baghdad , since we are close to signing the first EU-Iraq agreement in post-Saddam history ?
<en> Might they perhaps even resolve the Camp Ashraf drama in situ , since I am sure that your personal intervention could easily lead to a positive solution to it ?
<en> Baroness Ashton , you have already intervened on the subject of the Egyptian Copts ; however , not only has the persecution continued , but today , it is a worrying element in the so-called ' Arab Spring ' .
<en> The communications from the European External Action Service still talk of it as being a conflict between extremists .
<en> However , only Christians are dying and only churches are burning in Egypt .
<en> What is preventing us from acknowledging the truth , calling it by its name and extricating the Copts from their awkward position as hostages to a fundamentalist political project ?
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the turbulent events laden with uncertainties and hopes that are changing the political geography of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are increasingly posing a challenge to Europe and its external policy .
<en> In view of what is happening , it should be increasingly important for the European Union to be able to rely on a sound , consistent external policy capable of dealing with a difficult present and planning for a problematic future , in which international relations will be altered and the world will be profoundly changed .
<en> In view of the strategic repositioning of countries such as the United States , China and Russia , and growing shortages of raw materials and energy resources , Europe should develop a crucial , decisive role , but it is quite clearly showing itself to be unprepared for such challenges .
<en> For some time now , it has been moving too slowly towards coordination of the external and domestic policies of its Member States .
<en> There has been no substantial progress .
<en> Evidence of this is , on the one hand , the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and , on the other , the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority .
<en> We need to turn over a new leaf .
<en> Baroness Ashton , you have an important role ; please fulfil it to the utmost , in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out .

<2en> The financial crisis has highlighted the lack of effectiveness of the current corporate governance principles .
<2en> It is now vital for the lessons to be learnt from what has happened to avoid a similar situation recurring in the future .
<2en> The area of corporate governance is evolving all the time and it is the financial sector which has particular responsibility for serious , sustainable economic strategies .
<2en> We must maintain the sound , stable and competitive nature of financial institutions so that they can make a contribution to economic growth .
<2en> In this regard , I think that effective corporate governance must take into account equally the interests of all the stakeholders and , at the same time , the stability of the financial system .
<2en> This will allow the market to operate at its optimum and consumers will show increased confidence in financial institutions and transactions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome this report .
<en> The aim of the Green Paper under consideration here is to draw conclusions from the global financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers bank in autumn 2008 following the inappropriate securitisation of US subprime mortgages .
<en> In the light of the development of new financial instruments in a globalised world , the Green Paper takes a critical look at the soundness of financial institutions and of the financial system as a whole , and at the regulation and supervision of the system , with a view to preventing any repeat of the crisis in the future .
<en> The Commission regards the strengthening of corporate governance as central to its financial market reform and crisis prevention programme .
<en> In that connection , the Commission notes , in particular , that in the financial services sector , corporate governance must take account of the interests of other stakeholders ( depositors , savers , life insurance policy holders , etc . ) and of the stability of the financial system , owing to the systemic nature of many of the players involved
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Poor corporate governance in financial institutions - and particularly banks ' murky pay culture - was a key factor in creating the conditions for the financial crisis .
<en> Labour Euro MPs backed this report which , thanks to amendments adopted at the committee stage , calls for Commission action to raise financial firms ' corporate governance standards .
<en> These demands include stronger oversight of risks that a firm takes on , high standards of independence and diversity for members of firms ' boards , including better gender balance and , crucially , transparency around pay , so shareholders and the public can hold banks to account .
<en> As the Conservative-led government in the United Kingdom has shelved legislation on transparency introduced by the previous Labour Government , I welcome the inclusion of my proposal to introduce such a requirement at the EU level .
<en> Labour Euro MPs opposed the rapporteur 's amendments to weaken the committee report , including a lower requirement for representation of women , a slower timetable for action on pay reform and less information on staff pay .
<en> The Commission must now complete its consultation and swiftly bring forward ambitious proposals to ensure that governance of financial firms will help prevent , not facilitate , future crises .
<sp>
<2en> The recent financial crisis reinforced the need for us to look at the moral issues relating to managing financial institutions in a more responsible way .
<2en> Issues relating to remuneration policies , and governance of the remuneration of directors and managers of financial institutions , must be governed by ethical and moral principles that do not allow situations such as those experienced in the recent past , with the awarding of management prizes in companies that immediately afterwards filed for bankruptcy or were found to be in serious difficulties .
<2en> The EU must have a productive , social and environmental model with a long-term outlook that respects everyone 's interests : companies , shareholders and workers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The aim of the resolution is to strengthen corporate governance , which is considered by the Commission to be the major element of the programme of financial market reform and crisis prevention .
<en> I disagree with that because it may lead to an increase in corruption and violations .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Youth on the Move is one of the most important initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
<en> We must promote economic growth based on modern technologies , which can only be created by educated people .
<en> We must give the right support to children and young people .
<en> Foreign language instruction , sports and cultural activities , voluntary work and youth exchanges - these are programmes which should be accessible to children and young people in all regions of the European Union .
<en> We must bring about an improvement in educational standards and reduce disparities - at all levels of education , from nursery to university - in every region of the European Union .
<en> In the opinion of Professor Jacek Kochanowicz , a lack of the ability to cooperate is one of the greatest problems for the development of Poland and the European Union - we must change this , too .
<en> Human capital comes from education , and social capital comes from trust between people .
<en> Investing in educational and cultural programmes ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , first of all , we should look at the context in which we are having this debate .
<en> We need to compare the fine words we are hearing here on the importance of culture and education with the reality .
<en> The irrefutable reality is of a sharp divestment in these areas ; a retreat of the state that threatens its social role and has the result of exacerbating inequalities in access to education , to knowledge and to culture .
<en> The result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequalities .
<en> The reality in Member States such as Portugal is the closure of thousands of schools , thousands of teachers being without a job or a secure job , and the chronic underfunding of the state higher-education system and the increased cost of attending it .
<en> The reality is that budgets for culture are being slashed to penury levels .
<en> Let us not , therefore , ignore this reality that investment is urgently needed : all the more so if the shameful and obscurantist intervention plan drawn up by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and European Commission is implemented .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I should like to express my sympathy with your compatriots ; we look on Spain as a friend and sympathise whenever anything happens there .
<en> The ' Youth on the Move ' report is one of the most important initiatives included in the EU 2020 strategy for promoting and providing more opportunities for education and training for young people and helping them to make the transition from education to the labour market .
<en> Education , lifelong learning , innovation and culture certainly lead to progress .
<en> There is a Greek proverb which says that heads make capital , not the other way round , which is why we must identify , highlight and develop the skills and abilities of our young people , which we can do if we ensure that they can find employment in keeping with their qualifications and skills .
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , these reports are at best bestrewn with paradoxes and at worst are full of hypocrisy .
<en> They talk approvingly of diversity , but welcome the eradication of diversity between nations .
<en> The diversity that they promote within Member States involves the promotion of the cultures of recent arrivals , which are anything but European .
<en> As populations change , so will their cultures .
<en> Indigenous cultures will be displaced and lost .
<en> They talk about freedom of expression but are only convincing when they express their intolerance of those with whom they disagree .
<en> They want to promote only cultural values of which they approve ; those consistent with so-called ' European ' values .
<en> In the political sphere , we saw on Tuesday this Parliament 's attitude to freedom of expression when it voted to hand over a Member of this House for a show trial in France for a thought-crime offence , without even being given the opportunity to defend himself .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , the present situation of young people in Europe is very worrying - as you are aware - since there are five million young people out of work .
<en> Today , I am delighted with the European Commission 's ambition to want to democratise young people 's access in Europe .
<en> However , I believe that we have to go beyond this ' Youth on the Move ' programme and , above all , avoid the trap of wanting every young person to go to university .
<en> We need to be relevant to all groups of young people , including those who are the furthest removed from the European Union and especially , of course , apprentices .
<en> It is with this in mind , I believe , that we should urgently introduce a genuine mobility programme for these target groups , in addition to the Leonardo programme .
<en> I think that the Erasmus name , the Erasmus hallmark , should be used for all the programmes and in a variety of forms , in particular , for apprentices , so that we have the necessary ambitions to achieve our aims .
<en> The second issue is that of funding .
<en> We must put in the resources because , as many of you have pointed out , youth and education should be the top priority for the Union 's future .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , this is an opportunity for an extraordinary commitment to the social mobility of young people and a decisive commitment to training a generation with an open worldview ; a generation with skills that , because it has global vision and thinking , is capable of contributing to its regions ' development and to Europe 's progress .
<en> This is because , if all young Europeans have the experience of study , of a work placement or of employment in a different country , they will not just acquire more skills , greater independence and better vision , but they will , above all , gain enormous added value from contact with other young Europeans and exchanging experiences with them .
<en> More than ever , Europe needs a generation of Europeans who know and trust each other , and who know and trust Europe , in order to carry the project forward .
<en> Therefore , allow everyone from Fajã Grande in the Azores , Europe 's westernmost point , to participate .
<en> We must ensure that no one be left out for financial reasons .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Mr President , the report on early years learning includes a mention of the work experience approach to education for children from poorer families .
<en> Of these , the rapporteur identifies children from Roma families , who have very little access to early years learning , as the most at-risk group .
<en> It is therefore very important for Member States to create specific conditions for access to early years learning for children whose families do not , for various reasons , provide them with the sort of material and family support that would enable them to take part in the standard education system without major problems .
<en> Special care for children from the more at-risk groups , however , must be provided in a very sensitive way , in order to avoid stigmatising these children or families , which might increase the risk of their social exclusion .
<en> We must therefore systematically modify and improve the special care mechanisms for these children , so that we can successfully integrate as many children as possible from at-risk groups into our society .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , the first three years of a child 's life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning .
<en> Without a certain level of language acquisition , further learning is scarcely possible , as the language deficits can only be overcome with great difficulty with increasing age .
<en> The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge .
<en> At the same time , it declares that migrant families and minorities such as the Roma make much less use of the early years education offered than other families .
<en> We cannot allow it to be the case that the level of our schools continues to fall and fall because so many children quite simply cannot understand the teaching .
<en> In other words , every child - migrant or not - must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the work on creating a European early years learning framework based on shared goals and values points us in the right direction for the harmonisation of our education systems .
<en> Stressing the importance of the first years of life in a person 's subsequent development and emphasising the potential inherent in early childhood is extremely important in the context of implementation of the 2020 strategy .
<en> To my mind , the subject we are discussing is exceptionally relevant to the current situation .
<en> In my country , a new law entered into force last month on forms of care for children up to three years old .
<en> The new law extends the range of childcare facilities and introduces several new forms of care : children 's clubs , day carers , legal nannies and workplace nurseries .
<en> These changes are meant to create favourable conditions for the proper development of children .
<en> The variety of educational possibilities allows this development to be assisted and stimulated in all areas while making use of the child 's own natural potential .
<en> Opening workplace nurseries will make it easier for parents to return to the labour market after a longer break .
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , when referring to Youth on the Move , we are talking about money , but first of all we are talking about the future .
<en> Innovation , creativity , employability are topics that are really important for all of us in the European Union .
<en> It is good that the Commission has focused on this crucial moment of entering into the labour market , which is exactly what I would like to focus on too .
<en> Young people are confronted with the sad reality , with the bad working conditions of internships today , even with exploitation .
<en> And , of course , there is the stigma , when entering into the labour market , of wondering ' am I really needed ? ' when there are such high unemployment rates .
<en> That really is my huge topic right now , so I urge the Commissioner to please keep on track and focus also on the future , to create something like a statute for internships which establishes rules against exploitation ...

<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this document because the recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector and left many fishermen worrying about how to offset these additional costs , as the rise in oil prices is directly affecting fishermen 's incomes .
<2en> We need to make use of all the possibilities and financial margins available under the Community fisheries budget in order to finance emergency support measures for the industry , thereby enabling it to overcome the difficulties posed by the rise in fuel prices until such time as other types of measure are implemented .
<2en> The European Fisheries Fund ( EFF ) should continue to grant aid to improve the selectivity of fishing gear and to replace engines on grounds of safety , environmental protection and / or fuel economy , above all , for small-scale coastal and traditional fishermen .
<2en> In my opinion , the Commission must urgently propose investments , at both European and national levels , in new technologies in order to increase the energy efficiency of fishing vessels and so reduce fishermen 's dependency on fossil fuels .
<sp>
<2en> The resolution is an expression of Parliament 's concern for the state of the fisheries sector , the financial condition of fishing firms and the market price of fish .
<2en> It is an important sector , and fish is an important part of our diet .
<2en> I think Article 3 of the joint motion for a resolution , which expresses the will to increase aid to fishermen , is crucially important .
<2en> It is a solution which offers more advantages than the new guarantees proposed for the sector .
<2en> I hope the Commission and the Council will give the resolution serious consideration .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted against this resolution because I do not believe the EU should increase subsidies for the European fisheries sector or any other sector on the basis of a rise in oil prices .
<sp>
<2en> The recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector and left many fishers worrying about how to offset these additional costs .
<2en> We cannot forget that the rise in oil prices is directly affecting fishers ' incomes .
<2en> The incomes and wages of people working in the fisheries industry are insecure as a result of several factors , such as the irregular nature of fishing , the marketing approaches employed , and the way in which first-sale prices are set , which means that certain forms of national and EU public aid need to be maintained .
<2en> Moreover , the financial and economic crisis is having an impact on industrial sectors and small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) in particular , and is jeopardising activity and employment in primary and secondary sectors .
<2en> As in the past , we must now adopt temporary emergency measures to overcome the difficulties faced by the fisheries sector against the backdrop of rising oil prices .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the resolution and against all the amendments which were tabled .
<2en> New support measures need to be adopted in the fisheries sector , bearing in mind the combination of two factors : on the one hand , the high price of oil and , on the other , the low price of fish at first sale .
<2en> Fishing is an important economic sector for the European Union and needs to receive support at a time when the average price of a barrel of oil will remain at USD 80-100 .

<en> ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are in the middle of a crisis and , if truth be told , we have more important things to be doing at this point in time than pointing fingers and assigning blame .
<en> When you are in the middle of a crisis , all you should be doing is making your decisions and solving the crisis before doing anything else .
<en> Everything else can be discussed later .
<en> The first priority is to find a treatment for patients for these antibiotic-resistant bacteria and to trace the source of the outbreak .
<en> In addition , we need , above all , to communicate well in order to walk the tightrope between keeping the patients , consumers and producers informed and doing right by all of them .
<en> We can then turn our attention to the question of how our crisis management is actually going .
<en> This will certainly not be the last crisis .
<en> Who is in charge ?
<en> Too many authorities are involved , and somebody needs to take the lead .
<en> That is what the conversation today with you and the Council must be about .
<en> What will be the situation with leadership in future , and who will take on the role ?
<en> The use of antibiotics is indeed a thorn in our sides , for both animals and people .
<en> There are major differences between the Member States .
<en> Last but not least , there needs to be compensation for the damage done .
<en> To sum up , there needs to be clarity and drive .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , EHEC is the term of the last week .
<en> First of all , our sympathy , clearly , goes to the victims .
<en> In the interests of public health , the authorities have the obligation to provide them with information .
<en> The well-being of the people must come first .
<en> In the United States , they have an early-warning system to that end .
<en> The fact is that there have been over 2 000 infections and more than 20 people have died .
<en> People have to be told where this bacterium is .
<en> It was on Spanish cucumbers , where it certainly should not have been , as a faecal bacterium has absolutely no place on a foodstuff .
<en> When it comes to economic compensation , those responsible must pay , certainly not everyone else .
<en> Finally , I would like to observe that the Council was absent for the whole of the debate on this issue .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak in such an important debate .
<en> The citizens of the European Union need the European institutions to be effective in many areas , including in prevention of the spread of every kind of disease in every part of the European Union , and this is understandable .
<en> However , above all else , preventative agencies working in the area of health and food safety should be ready with ways of preventing panic .
<en> These institutions should be completely independent of the administrations of Member States , and should even be empowered to act with executive authority in the event of a crisis .
<en> We did not manage to prevent panic this time .
<en> This has resulted in losses running into millions , and Polish farmers have also been affected .
<en> The price of vegetables on the Polish market fell by two thirds in the course of a week .
<en> Every day , vegetable producers incur losses of PLN 2 million .
<en> Several months ago , we raised the alarm concerning swine flu .
<en> The European institutions did not pass muster then and were not able to prevent panic from spreading across the European Union .
<en> Now , something similar has happened .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , solidarity must prevail : that is one of the European Union 's founding principles , but solidarity must not be an excuse for the various stakeholders to shirk their responsibilities .
<en> It is not right that the German authorities failed to defer , from the start , to the European Union in a tragedy that has transcended their borders ever since the end of their first press conference , when they wrongly blamed Spanish cucumbers .
<en> It is not right to make unsubstantiated accusations , to communicate uncertain information and to cause such confusion .
<en> It is not right that all the principles of crisis communication have been flouted in this way .
<en> Because of this , the crisis has turned into hysteria .
<en> These rumours and witch-hunts fuelled by those same authorities have caused enormous harm ; they indicate a lack of responsibility .
<en> The bond of trust between consumers and producers has once again been broken .
<en> Let us ensure that this tragedy is not a terrible waste , too , by learning important lessons from it : we need to decide on the best ways of implementing a robust cross-border traceability system and establish a European communication unit and a crisis management unit .
<en> If we do not learn the lessons of this failure quickly , 23 people will have died for nothing .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank you and also all the Members who contributed to this debate .
<en> I will not have time to react to every single interesting comment that was made , but I can assure you we have taken note of the feeling expressed in this House .
<en> Today , as I said , I will be attending the Council of Agriculture Ministers .
<en> Tomorrow , I will be in Berlin to participate in a coordination meeting between the food safety sector and the health sector , together with the experts we have in place there .
<en> My main preoccupation is to stop hospitalisations : that is my first and foremost objective .
<en> I am concentrating on mobilisation and on speeding up the identification of the cause of the outbreak .
<en> We set up the crisis unit on 30 May 2011 and , at Commission level , we were fully mobilised at that point .
<en> My public health department mobilised the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) and the ECDC has activated its crisis mode in order to make scientific assessments as rapidly as possible .
<en> The Commission immediately asked the ECDC to carry out a scientific assessment .
<en> In daily meetings with Member State experts , the Commission has coordinated assessment measures : the establishment of common case definitions , case reporting , patient questionnaires , sharing perspectives on treatment , and hygiene advice to the public are some of the outputs we have achieved in a very short time span .
<en> We have to be very careful and we have to keep everything in perspective .
<en> It is easy for all of us to sit in judgment with hindsight and to make statements , rather than being in the eye of the storm when a crisis is happening .
<en> We have to be careful in our statements and criticism because , while insisting - as I do - that decisions be made on the basis of well-sustained evidence , we should not terrify those who are called upon to take risky decisions , sometimes in very difficult situations , fearing that afterwards they will be put in the dock and everyone will pass judgment on their decisions .
<en> I think this aspect of situation management is very important .
<en> The same goes for checking and controlling the information that is circulating .
<en> We have a system in Europe that allows for fast communication and , in order to have fast communication , we apply the subsidiarity principle - looking to the lowest possible level as the base from which communication should start .
<en> We have to be careful because , if we begin to add layer upon layer of controls and checks to verify the information circulating , then we will defeat the purpose of speed , and in circumstances where health is concerned , and where life and death is sometimes at stake , speed is of the utmost importance .
<en> As regards information , we are supplying continuous information as we receive it .
<en> In this respect , we at the Commission agree that coordinated and rapid communication is an essential element of risk management .
<en> If you remember , in 2009-2010 , as a result of our H1N1 experience , we set up a system to coordinate public health communication , and our EU Health Security Committee has a network of communicators .
<en> We will need to involve regional actors more effectively in this process , as well as the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
<en> As recently as yesterday , I was on the phone with Margaret Chan , the Director-General of the WHO , about this aspect of coordinating information and ensuring full coordination before any communication takes place .
<en> We will study what happened , and undertake closer investigations and analyses .
<en> Once we are confident that the contamination has been stopped , we will concentrate on what happened in the information sector , with regard to investigation protocols and in terms of coordination across the board when the crisis occurred , and we will then reflect on whether we need more tools and closer European coordination .
<en> That may be part of the answer but , as you say , it is going to involve a lot of discussion both here in Parliament and also at Member State level .
<en> On the issue of compensation , this will be discussed this afternoon in the AGRI Council , and I am sure that my colleague , Commissioner Cioloş , is doing his utmost to identify and develop ways and means of compensating our farmers who have been suffering as a result of this problem .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The reason we have voted in favour is because we refuse to accept the fallacious arguments put forward by the Spanish Socialist Workers ' Party ( PSOE ) and the People 's Party ( PP ) on the industry 's competitiveness .
<2en> Any gain in competitiveness also requires generating incentives for investment in more efficient means of transport , fair rules of competition , and internalising the social and environmental costs of general economic activity .
<2en> The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has always strived for cost internalisation and for all goods to have a cost that is fair in social and environmental terms .
<2en> We are aware that the minimal proposal falls short of our aspirations by a long stretch , but our vote is also an expression of our confidence that the process will not end here and that an important step has been taken by acknowledging the need to internalise transport costs .
<2en> We also remind the Member States that they must go even further , bringing in legislation to introduce fairer and more efficient tax systems that include all the external costs mentioned , and we urge the Commission to continue to work so that its future proposal on this matter may prove more ambitious .
<sp>
<2en> The recommendation is the last stage in the procedural process of amending Directive 1999 / 62 / EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures ( Eurovignette ) .
<2en> It is the fruit of lengthy consultations and compromises with the various political groups .
<2en> Charging users for some associated external costs enables Member States to make their national road charging systems more efficient , which means they are better able to manage transport demand .
<2en> Furthermore , the ' polluter pays ' principle helps to make users in the sector more aware of their responsibilities .
<2en> To conclude , the public will be more supportive if the additional revenue generated from infrastructure and external costs is allocated transparently and effectively , and this would also serve to reduce the external costs of road transport more quickly .
<sp>
<2en> The taxation of heavy goods vehicles , which was debated today immediately prior to the vote , is another example of how what was originally a very good principle has , in the end , remained relatively weak and has lost much of its impact .
<2en> I think that the taxes collected should have been directed much more towards developing transport infrastructure , but unfortunately , as often happens , the Council really does not have any good ideas in this regard .
<2en> Many countries see in all this an opportunity to gain extra tax revenues which can be put to many other uses .
<2en> It is a very positive development that the adoption of this directive will end the situation in Estonia in which vehicles from other countries do not pay the tax in Estonia , but our vehicles pay in other countries .
<2en> Even though this report has become weaker in many respects during the proceedings , and that Parliament has had to give in on several provisions , this is still a big step forward , and I feel that I must give it my full support .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report .
<2en> It is a compromise based on the ' polluter pays ' principle , in other words , the principle of making it possible to charge for certain external costs of transport , in the form of pollution , noise and traffic congestion , for example .
<2en> Implementing the external costs of transport is a step in the right direction .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - El Khadraoui has done a great job on this report .
<en> The only way that we can make progress in fighting climate change is responsible reports such as this one which hold those accountable who cause the most pollution and which is why I was able to support it .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures , under the terms of the European Parliament document voted on in plenary today , represents an increase in costs related to the movement of this type of transport .
<2en> The Eurovignette is a measure which penalises the outlying countries of the EU at a time when those countries are undergoing a period of economic and financial difficulty , whilst , at the same time , providing additional revenue for the countries of central Europe .
<2en> The review of the directive in line with Parliament 's position will have considerable negative effects on competitiveness and economic development for several Member States , such as Portugal .
<2en> While acknowledging that the final text adopted today in Strasbourg is less negative than the text that was previously agreed in parliamentary committee , the imposition of this charge will still become a reality and will mean an increase in existing costs for the outlying countries of the EU .
<2en> For these reasons , as a matter of national interest and as a member of Parliament 's Committee on Transport and Tourism , I voted against the document tabled in plenary .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I abstained on the Eurovignette vote today .
<en> I abstained because , in the case of Catalonia , what is proposed would penalise a lot of small and medium enterprises that do not have the option of putting goods and products on trains - in particular , because of the difference of gauge , which constitutes a physical barrier to completion of the Internal Market - and would damage their business greatly .
<sp>
<2en> Any new EU rules on charging heavy goods vehicles must maintain a balance between the environmental needs and economic interests of the new Member States .
<2en> Lithuania is a valuable transit country for Europe .
<2en> Freight transportation and hard working lorry drivers have become synonymous with our country .
<2en> According to data from the Lithuanian Road Administration , the number of heavy goods vehicles on principle routes has tripled in the last decade and they are helping to form the backbone of our economy .
<2en> Lithuania has already been racked by the financial crisis and a rise in transport costs would be a heavy blow .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that the Member States should be given opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient .
<2en> I am familiar with the issues of pollution mentioned in this report and I take them very seriously , but additional charges for air and noise pollution are not the answer .
<2en> The problem is much greater than the report suggests .
<2en> In many EU Member States , road infrastructure is in need of further development .
<2en> At the same time , in Lithuania , the funding earmarked for road management and development has dropped by more than 20 % in the last few years .
<sp>
<2en> I endorsed adoption of the directive .
<2en> I think the decision to extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs , in other words , by the costs of environmental pollution and noise , is more advisable than the previous version , which was restricted only to covering the costs of road infrastructure .
<2en> The directive is favourable to transit countries , so MEPs from Poland should be particularly keen on its adoption .
<2en> It is also worth stressing the fact that the charges are to be lower the higher the ecological category of the heavy goods vehicle .
<2en> Fortunately , vehicles with a maximum permissible laden weight of 3.5-12 tonnes and car drivers will be exempt from the charges .
<2en> The structure of tolls will depend on the time of day , which , in my opinion , will help to discourage people from using sections of road which are at risk of congestion during peak periods .
<2en> Another important provision of the directive is the one which concerns the way in which income from tolls is spent .
<2en> This money is to be reinvested in transport infrastructure of any kind , while a minimum of 15 % of the revenues are to be earmarked for TEN-T projects .
<2en> I think we also need long-term measures which will bring about convergence in the methods which all charging systems of the Member States use to calculate external costs .
<2en> This could guarantee transparency in the signals given to the European road haulage sector .
<sp>
<2en> In the light of positive experiences in Switzerland since the introduction of the performance-based HGV levy in 2001 , there are no objections to the new directive .
<2en> Journey numbers have fallen by 10 % in Switzerland since 2001 , while the quantity of goods transported has risen by 60 % and it has proven possible to reduce emissions - a win-win scenario .
<2en> The earmarking of revenues is aimed at promoting acceptance by the public and reducing external road transport costs .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The recent financial crisis has drawn attention to three key problems in the area of rating agencies , which are the lack of economic competition , the excessive dependency of the regulatory framework on external rating assessments , and the fact that the rating agencies provide no guarantee for their ratings .
<2en> I am not sure whether the rapporteur 's proposal to establish a European Rating Agency is a sensible solution .
<2en> There is no guarantee that the European Rating Agency would acquire a good reputation and would become a genuine new player among rating agencies , that it would be credible , or that it would be able to convince the market of its absolute independence of any public body , whether the Member States , the European Commission or any other public entity .
<2en> The rapporteur 's proposal to establish a network of European rating agencies seems more sensible to me , since cooperation between rating agencies active at national level in making use of the available human and financial resources should encourage competition in this area by covering a broad range of activities and different markets , thereby making it possible to achieve the same level as the large rating agencies which have a global scale of operations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted against the potential adoption of EU harmonisation of credit rating agencies as the standards may vary , and necessarily so , between Member States .
<en> Without one single common currency , and in view of the volatility of markets , particularly in the failing eurozone economies , the UK faces the possibility of being tangled in a mire of harmonised credit ratings which would have to encompass all economic circumstances across the Union and could expose UK business and industry to hazardous ventures supported by EU-wide credit ratings .
<en> It is up to independent economies in independent Member States to determine their conditions and limitations concerning credit rating .
<sp>
<2en> Given the consequences that credit ratings for sovereign debt can have for the market , budgetary balances and the general welfare of the people , it is imperative that these be based on trustworthy facts and figures .
<2en> In order to preserve the truth and fairness of such ratings , there is a need to increase the transparency underlying these decisions , as well as the accountability of these agencies .
<2en> I therefore support and welcome the establishment of priorities for the regulation of credit rating agencies proposed today , which I consider essential in order to overcome the problems in this industry .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The situation with credit ratings agencies must be addressed in Europe .
<en> These private , profit-orientated organisations have far too much power over sovereign governments and I fully support plans to address this anomaly at European level .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the report on credit rating agencies .
<2en> It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies , which have played such a negative role in the present crisis , to continue to have the right , granted by the EU itself , to rate not only companies , but also the economies of the Member States .
<2en> The European Parliament should be more decisive and radical in its decisions on action by credit rating agencies , especially after the damage they have caused to European economies and European citizens .
<2en> However , the report is spineless .
<2en> The regulations it proposes are cowardly and the lack of transparency surrounding credit rating agencies basically remains as before .
<2en> By no stretch of the imagination has the problem been resolved of ratings by self-seeking private firms , be they American now or European in the future , which alone foster the speculation mafia .
<2en> The report should promote a public , democratically-controlled agency which has nothing to do with private interests and which can play a particular role within the framework of solidarity between the States and their citizens .

<en> ( EL ) Madam President , firstly , may I wish you every success at tomorrow 's summit , the agenda of which includes global governance , the global economy , the accession of Russia to the WTO and international issues , including developments in North Africa and the Middle East .
<en> Russia is the EU 's third biggest trading partner .
<en> EU exports to Russia total EUR 65.6 billion .
<en> According to official statistics , the Russian economy is growing at a rate of 4 % , despite the economic climate , and this is forecast to continue for a long time .
<en> Its accession to the World Trade Organisation will create numerous opportunities in economic relations between the European Union and Russia .
<en> At the same time , however , it will bring about innovative changes in energy , nuclear energy and international security .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , we are aware that Russia is of significance to the EU , not just where economic matters are concerned , but also as a strategic partner .
<en> The ban on imports of EU vegetables that has been imposed by Moscow is undoubtedly problematic in the run-up to the negotiations on Russia 's accession to the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , and we should make sure that Russia does not come into conflict with the WTO rules in future .
<en> There are also problems , however , in the area of the still unimplemented agreement from 2006 in respect of EU airlines .
<en> Relations between the EU and Russia are further strained by the planned US missile defences in Romania .
<en> If the EU is serious about its strategies for improving relations with Russia , then it must firstly resolve these problems and secondly , give consideration to Russian sensitivities relating to an historical sphere of influence that undoubtedly exists , or which exists as far as Russia is concerned .
<en> That is the only way we will make any progress .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , the partnership between the European Union and Russia entails responsibility , including towards third countries .
<en> I would like to draw the Commission 's attention to the paragraph of the resolution which calls on Russia not to use the supply of energy resources as a tool for influencing its neighbours ' policies .
<en> This is what has happened in the case of Ukraine , where Mr Putin , the Russian Prime Minister , said quite openly during his last meeting with Mr Azarov , the Ukrainian Prime Minister , that lower prices would only be offered and the gas contract renegotiated if Ukraine entered into a customs union with Russia , Belarus and Kazakhstan , which would mean abandoning its European plans and aspirations .
<en> This is nothing short of blackmail .
<en> If the contract is not renegotiated , gas prices on the Russia-Ukraine border may reach EUR 500 per 1 000 m3 .
<en> Ukraine is already paying the highest prices in Europe for Russian gas , although it is closest to the sources of this gas .
<en> This situation may result in a very serious economic and social crisis in Ukraine .
<en> I would like to make it clear that the European Union has obligations towards Ukraine , given that we are currently successfully negotiating the country 's entry into a free trade area or the creation of such an area , and will , in the near future , engage in relations with it as an ally of the European Union .
<en> I would call on the Commission to demand quite plainly that Russia ceases all such practices and puts a stop to them .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , yet another EU-Russia Summit is taking place this week .
<en> Major changes have occurred in the world since the last one .
<en> Let me mention among them , firstly , the Arab revolutions , a process of deep transformation which affects virtually the whole Arab world .
<en> The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant reshaped the future of nuclear power , especially with regard to safety .
<en> Climate change has brought more and more dangerous consequences .
<en> Osama is dead but terrorism is alive and has targeted innocent people all over the world .
<en> The list of events is long and all of them concern both the EU and Russia , two neighbouring global players with predominantly similar or complementary long-term interests .
<en> Their relations can only be further developed if they are based on mutual respect , openness and transparency .
<en> Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort , if not destroy , these relations .
<en> The EU and Parliament have always been clear about the expectations of European citizens .
<en> Now , with regard to the upcoming summit , I would like to highlight four issues .
<en> First of all , the summit should bring decisive progress on all the remaining obstacles related to Russia 's accession to the WTO .
<en> This important step will create better opportunities for the business communities on both sides and will further liberalise trade and economic relations globally .
<en> In this respect , the application of protectionist measures is counterproductive and we hope they will not be hidden behind overplayed health threats , which is , in our opinion , the recent case with the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU .
<en> We hope that the road map for visa-free travelling announced in May will accelerate further visa facilitation and will bring closer the moment when the visa regime between the EU and Russia will be fully liberalised .
<en> To this end , Parliament expects that some politically sensitive issues will be properly addressed by the Russian authorities , in particular , by stopping the issuing of Russian passports to the residents of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
<en> I would like to see a more constructive engagement of Russia in our efforts to support democratisation , economic and social progress and stability in the six countries in the Eastern Partnership .
<en> The last two years have clearly shown that this EU initiative is not aimed at competition , but rather at cooperation with Russia , since the stable and self-confident common neighbourhood is in the interests of both the EU and Russia .
<en> In this respect , we urge Russia to intensify its efforts in facilitating the peaceful resolution of the conflicts in Transnistria and in the more and more worrying Nagorno-Karabakh region .
<en> Finally , I would like to mention that the EU and Russia should fully cooperate in the revision and elaboration of higher standards for nuclear power safety , following the events in Japan .
<en> We expect that higher standards are kept , not only in the newly built , but also in the already operational , nuclear power plants .
<en> I hope that this issue can be part of the discussions in Nizhny Novgorod .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , Canada 's Prime Minister , Pierre Trudeau , likened sharing a border with the USA to sharing a bed with an elephant .
<en> Our Union must share its bed with a bear .
<en> We must continue to try to develop relations in the context of the four common spaces and on the basis of last year 's Partnership for Modernisation .
<en> As the Commissioner said , the last two years have seen improvements .
<en> The agreement on a gas advisory forum and the improved early warning mechanism are among these .
<en> Progress this month in solving the Transnistria conflict would be another positive step .
<en> However , as Baroness Ashton said last month after the Khodorkovsky / Lebedev judgment , and as the European Court on Human Rights has concluded on many occasions , real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business , which are too often absent in Russia .
<en> A structured civil society dialogue would help ; common action to fight climate change would help to build trust .
<en> But the Russian bear still has a sore head and I advise the Commission to carry to Nizhny Novgorod not only a jar of honey but also a large net .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted against this report as I strongly oppose the programme of crippling austerity measures which is being driven through the European Union by the centre-right .
<en> This package of economic governance reforms will stifle growth in the EU at the very time we need investment for growth , for research and development and for jobs , to secure the economic future of Europe .
<en> This financial reform package will hit the poorest in Europe the hardest , while leaving the cause of the crisis - the financial sector - untouched .
<en> I welcome improved coordination of economic and fiscal policy in Europe , but strongly oppose the short-term vision under which this is being imposed .
<en> Long-term investment in the green economy , in scientific research and in infrastructure is absolutely crucial to economic stability , job creation and growth , and I cannot support this package of reforms which seeks crippling austerity across Europe .
<sp>
<2en> This opinion relates to the proposal for a regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area .
<2en> We believe that the enforcement of budgetary surveillance should always be subject to overarching objectives of the EU and , in particular , to the requirements of Article 9 TFEU relating to the promotion of a high level of employment , the guarantee of adequate social protection and the fight against social exclusion .
<2en> It is equally important for the enhanced surveillance framework to be established in the context of the European Semester of policy coordination .
<2en> In order to enhance budgetary surveillance , an enforcement system should be composed not only of fines ( sanctions ) but also incentives , thereby strengthening the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments alike .
<2en> Lastly , we maintain that the fines collected from the Member States which fail to comply with their respective recommendations should be used in support of the EU 's long-term investment and job targets .
<sp>
<2en> This report makes it clear what kind of sanctions await Member States which do not bend to the commands of the European Commission .
<2en> It shows no concern at all about the consequences that such sanctions will have on the people , nor about the legitimacy of the Commission imposing sanctions on elected governments .
<2en> The only concession that is made is on public debates , which cannot take place in the Member State affected by the sanction .
<2en> In other words , the people should not interfere in the machinations of a process of which they are the victims .
<2en> I will never allow the Commission to attack France .
<2en> I am voting against this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The stability criteria were not respected in the past .
<en> It is to be assumed that incentives will not help in the future either .
<en> It is open to question whether the European Parliament and the national parliaments will be able to play a substantial role in any monitoring process .
<en> I believe that macroeconomic imbalances in the EU and in the euro area can only be effectively redressed by splitting the euro into two currency zones .
<en> Further planned rescue packages are not required merely out of a sense of fairness and will lead to major difficulties in the northern EU Member States in the future .
<en> Although I essentially agree with the report , I reject its approach , which is why I am voting against it .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I seriously doubt that the Stability and Growth Pact , which has failed to work so far , will suddenly become a panacea in one of the most difficult economic phases in the history of the EU .
<en> Although this would be desirable , in view of the current crisis , it remains a chimera .
<en> We have reached a stage where we can no longer afford further rescue packages .
<en> Moreover , dipping into national treasuries and using taxpayers ' money to save budgetary delinquents is very unfair .
<en> I therefore voted against this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mrs Izquierdo , but I have to inform you , in the kindest possible way , that you have used almost double your time allowance .
<en> When in the Chair , I never cut speakers off .
<en> I believe you should regulate yourselves , and I would ask other Members of Parliament not to follow Mrs Izquierdo 's example in terms of time , although the content of her speech was very valuable .
<en> Mrs Fraga has the floor for two minutes .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , whilst I do not intend to disregard other reports , I shall concentrate on the monitoring report , which the rapporteur , Mrs McKenna , has tackled in a very realistic manner .
<2en> We are not here just to say what the fishermen wish to hear .
<2en> In a period of crisis such as we are now experiencing in the fisheries sector the temptation to flout the rules obviously increases , and this simply further emphasizes the fact that monitoring is one of the major failures of the common fisheries policy .
<2en> We must stress that whilst monitoring of their own fishermen is exclusively in the hands of Member States it is virtually certain to be ineffective .
<2en> Requests for control measures double in lean periods , but always for other people , and this is certainly one of the reasons for the current problem of over-fishing .
<2en> Member States cannot be deprived of their powers , but the Commission must strengthen its own control and monitor that of Member States , beyond the reach of partisan pressure and also of isolated and opportunistic moves which in fact solve little or nothing , such as the obsession over the control of distant-water fleets .
<2en> This is undoubtedly needed , Mr Lannoye , but anyone familiar with these fisheries knows that the Community 's fleets in external waters are , for the most part , among the best supervised in the world ( as in the NAFO case ) , whereas internally nothing is done .
<2en> Instead of lavishing so much attention on fleets which are already under control , we should reinforce the supervisory measures on the European Union 's roads , which are undoubtedly carrying a fluctuating traffic in prohibited species which is absolutely disgraceful .
<2en> I believe effective control over compliance with MAGPs is also needed , as well as the introduction of a system of genuinely deterrent penalties .
<2en> As for the proposals for cutbacks ....
<sp>
<en> Mrs Fraga , you should not take the sound of the gavel as a call to halt , merely as a warning that you have used up your own time allocation and now have Parliament 's time available at your discretion .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I have noted your comment and I shall comply with the instructions of those presiding over this Assembly .
<2en> I therefore believe that I have now said enough .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , in isolated coastal communities such as my own constituency , there are very limited possibilities for locally-based economic development initiatives .
<en> One success story in recent years has been the growth of the salmon production sector .
<en> It is a sector with considerable potential but like any other business it needs some reasonable stability in terms of its business conditions .
<en> People involved in it need some predictability for their business margins .
<en> This Parliament and the European institutions need no explanation about the importance of stability for mediumterm policy .
<en> We certainly know it in macro-economic terms with regard to EMU .
<en> But in micro-economic terms at the level of the salmon industry consider the implications of Norway , a state outside the Union which produces a massive surplus for export - and has the potential to produce much more in the immediate future - and floods our market to such an extent that the anti-dumping case when it is examined will hold .
<en> That is better late than never .
<en> It has totally destabilized the prices and on four occasions since 1989 we have tried the minimum import price response and it has not worked .
<en> Frankly , if we are to give these coastal communities a chance to survive , there is only one probable long-term answer : get tough , bring in quantitative restrictions .
<en> The Council dodged the issue ; we should not .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I have great respect for the Swedish people 's desire for freedom , but I should like to ask whether the fact that Sweden remained so free and independent in the post-war period as is described in the question is not connected with the fact that many NATO and European Union states contributed to preserving peace in the Western hemisphere in the face of communism , at great sacrifice .
<2en> Do you not take the view that peace and freedom will also only be preserved in future if all states are equally prepared to assume their share of the burden and do not , so to speak , shirk their responsibilities and leave the others to shoulder the burden alone ?
<sp>
<2en> Thank you very much .
<2en> May I just say that Sweden has been free of military alliances and has remained neutral for 200 years !
<2en> It is not just a question of neutrality during the Second World War .
<2en> Seventy per cent of the Swedish people insist that this neutrality be preserved .
<2en> The Swedish and the Finnish foreign ministers have made it clear that we are prepared to participate in peace keeping operations , though not in anything to do with military intervention .
<2en> The distinction between peace keeping and the promotion of peace , or enforcing the peace , is very important and I believe that Commissioner van den Broek is very well aware of this .
<2en> Sweden does not take part in any active military operations whatsoever , and will not do so either before or after the government conference .
<sp>
<en> That is noted .
<sp>
<en> I call Mr Smith on a point of order .
<sp>
<en> Can you explain to me why , when Commissioners are designated 20 minutes each , Commissioner Van den Broek gets twice as long as any other Commissioner ?
<en> I know he is very talented , but is he twice as good ?
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I too wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council very warmly for his detailed evaluation of the situation .
<2en> I would like to ask him whether any special measures are envisaged for the Kosovo region .
<2en> After all , a few days ago we heard from the Serbian foreign minister that this region is now fully incorporated in the territory of the present Yugoslavia and that no special status can therefore be envisaged for this oppressed region .
<2en> I would like to know whether the Council can take can take special measures in this regard .
<sp>
<en> I am afraid I do not have such information in my brief but I realize that it is a matter of great concern .
<en> I will look into the matter and will communicate directly with the honourable Member .
<sp>
<en> I should just like to thank Mr Mitchell for the way he has conducted the questions .
<en> We have appreciated your company very much and the answers you have given both personally and on behalf of the Council .
<en> That concludes Question Time .
<en> Questions not taken for lack of time will be answered in writing .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I refer to page 1 of yesterday 's Minutes .
<en> Both Mr Smith and I raised the question of the list for Question Time and the fact that the questions we had tabled to Commissioner Kinnock on transport were not included in the transport section .
<en> We wondered whether there had been a simple administrative blunder or whether there had been some political manoeuvre to prevent embarrassment for the United Kingdom Government .
<en> The President in the chair , Mr Imbeni , said he would report the matter to the Commission .
<en> Has the presidency had any news from the Commission about what happened to these questions ?
<sp>
<en> Mr McMahon , the matter is being dealt with , and the Commission will decide which Commissioner is to answer your question .
<en> That will certainly be discussed , and the Commission is free to decide which of the Commissioners will answer it .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I was well aware who the Commissioner would be : I tabled the question on transport to Commissioner Kinnock , who is the Transport Commissioner .
<en> Now someone in this institution - or in one of the two institutions - decided not to refer it to Commissioner Kinnock .
<en> I want to know whether the failure is in Parliament 's or the Commission 's services , and I want to know whether it is a simple administrative blunder or a political manoeuvre !
<en> Only the President can find that out !
<sp>
<en> No , Mr McMahon , it is neither of those things .
<en> I can only repeat what I have just said .
<en> The questions are submitted to the Commission as a collegial body , and the Commission itself then decides who will answer a particular question .
<en> In other words , neither we nor you can decide in this case that Mr Kinnock will answer your question .

<en> The week before last three Members of this Parliament - Angela Billingham , Edward McMillan-Scott and myself - wrote to the President 's Office to ask for urgent action to be taken on behalf of a number of citizens whose properties in Spain have been wrongly seized by banks - one of those citizens being my own constituent , Mr Frank Clark .
<en> We have had no reply as such from your office - no doubt due to an oversight .
<en> I would ask that your office help us to urgently respond and to show how this institution can be a defender and fighter for our citizens ' rights where wrongs have taken place , particularly in an area which is part of the single market and European citizenship .
<en> We ask for your assistance on that case .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I rise to confirm what has just been said by Mr Teverson .
<en> I am sorry that Edward McMillan-Scott is not in the Hemicycle this morning because he has been dealing with this matter for over 15 years .
<en> A bad situation is now a desperate situation , with properties actually being sold as we speak .
<en> We have asked for intervention .
<en> It would appear that the Spanish authorities are running rings around the European laws and this is a quite disgraceful state of affairs .
<en> I seek the assistance of the President and of all our colleagues in this Hemicycle .
<sp>
<en> I will ask the President to draw this matter to the attention of the Spanish authorities .

<en> Question No 3 by María Izquierdo Rojo ( H-0384 / 97 )
<en> Subject : Job protection under the proposal for a regulation on the COM in raw tobacco
<en> Will the Council give priority to job protection in the new regulation on the COM in raw tobacco ?
<en> What specific improvements has it in mind for the benefit of producers in Granada , Extremadura and other highly disadvantaged Objective 1 regions ?
<en> Notwithstanding the clear concern with tobacco-growing in Austria , on which the attention of certain EU institutions is so intensely focused , will the Mediterranean countries be treated fairly ?
<sp>
<en> In response to the question on the raw tobacco COM , I would like to recall that the Council discussed the Commission report on the matter at the beginning of the year .
<en> That report includes an analysis of the social and economic situation of the market in question and the outcome of the reform of this regulation which took place in 1992 .
<en> It also contains a certain number of possible scenarios for a new Community policy in this sector .
<en> In the light of the debate held in the Council of Ministers , I would principally point out the following points : first of all , all delegations expressed considerable respect for the Commission report and the analysis of the situation on the tobacco market contained in it .
<en> As far as the approach to be taken , the objectives and main elements of a reform of the raw tobacco COM , it was virtually unanimous even if some different points of view did emerge , concerning the extent of the reform and the nature of specific measures to be taken .
<en> Finally , Mr President , the Commission has shown considerable consideration for the comment on the basis by the delegation .
<en> It declared that it would study these remarks with all the necessary attention in the framework of preparations for its formal proposal .
<en> To conclude , the Council urged the Commission to introduce these proposals as quickly as possible , as soon as it had all of the necessary information and data , including the European Parliament 's point of view on the report .
<en> Once these proposals have been made , the Council would obviously then have to take due account of the European Parliament 's opinion on this matter .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President-in-Office , your answer was most improper .
<2en> It is improper for the Council to answer in this bureaucratic , descriptive way to a question not referring to the report presented by the Commission but a question about jobs .
<2en> I want to ask the Council : What are we going to do with the southern farmers , if they can grow neither tobacco nor oliveoil ?
<2en> My question is about jobs : what you in your speeches call ' the first priority of our policies ' : jobs .
<2en> Yet , when you are asked about a huge reform of tobacco-growing , your answer is just ' bla , bla , bla ... ' .
<2en> Do you not think that preserving jobs has to be the condition , the basic premise of any actions provided for by the Regulation to be approved by the Council ?
<2en> Please answer that question .
<2en> What impact is it going to have ?
<2en> Do you have studies ?
<2en> Have you conducted them ?
<2en> What will the social and economic consequences be ?
<2en> I can tell you that in Granada over 2000 families live off this crop .
<2en> They do not live in luxury but this is their mainstay .
<2en> How can you just answer by saying that the Commission report is ' bla , bla , bla ' ?
<2en> You are in charge of the European Union and you are stopping the European Parliament from having any further powers .
<sp>
<2en> I appreciate the member 's heartfelt arguments in favour of this cause , which does indeed deserve all of the European Union 's attention and I hope that the European Union will recognize this later on , when the IGC discusses the matter .
<2en> But I will only answer the subject contained in the question .
<2en> It is obvious that employment is on the agenda of everything that we undertake .
<2en> I think that an employment policy does not always have to be approached as an item in itself but should also be dealt with as a whole - otherwise , arguments are always put forward when we are dealing with the agricultural policy , to examine the available resources but also the corresponding market and labour possibilities , in the limited framework of the local and current causes of a strong competitive position and the difficult position of competitors on the market in terms of prices .
<2en> I go along with your insistence that the Union take measures in favour of employment , but I do not agree when you say that all we do is speak and do nothing .
<2en> That is unfair to the way in which this subject has been dealt with , and at the same time you are not doing justice to the information that I gave you in my answer .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President-in-Office , the subject of the importance of jobs in relation with the future of tobacco-growing in the Mediterranean countries of the European Union is a recurring theme in the European Parliament - I myself have already asked questions about it to the Commission and the Council .
<2en> Today I wish to raise this matter again , since we now have the opportunity to discuss the COM on raw tobacco .
<2en> This is a worrying matter for many modest families , for example in the Spanish provinces of Granada and Cáceres , we are waiting for the decisions to be taken by the European institutions .
<2en> We think that the solution is to reject measures to abandon tobacco-growing , for the simple reason that it would not lead to a drop in tobacco consumption but an increase in tobacco imports , with perverse consequences and increased joblessness in European tobacco producing areas .
<2en> We think it unwise to change the premium or take similar measures .
<2en> However , it would be more proper to increase the percentage for research funds from 1 to 2 % .
<2en> You mentioned measures to be taken by the Council .
<2en> What can you tell us , Mrs Van Dok , about those measures ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I am afraid I cannot accept that , because it does not actually remove the real problem .
<en> So I would propose - and I hope the House will follow me - that we vote in favour of my amendment .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the motion for a resolution )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , as regards paragraph 8 of Amendment No 6 , I should like to ask whether the rapporteur agrees to take it as an addition to rather than a substitution for paragraph 8 .
<sp>
<en> Mr Fantuzzi , it is Mr Collins who should ask for that .
<sp>
<en> I would be nearly happy if it was taken as an addition .
<en> It would be very gracious of the rapporteur if he would accept that .
<sp>
<en> It is a bit difficult , because we have voted already so it is too late .
<en> I do not agree with that , but I will leave it to my colleagues to decide .

<en> I believe that this Parliament has rarely made such an exhibition of itself or shown itself to be so completely powerless as yesterday during the debate on the situation in Algeria .
<en> The meeting between Algerian and European Parliaments that was so heatedly argued for by almost all the speakers will of course not solve anything at all and was merely non-committal " show politics ' which sensible people can only treat with contempt .
<en> Nobody could accuse me of having the slightest sympathy for the murderers who are carrying out the Islamic reign of terror in Algeria .
<en> We can , of course , ask ourselves what the difference is between a possible ISF regime in Algeria , on the one hand , and the Islamic terror regimes supported so keenly by the West in countries such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait , on the other hand .
<en> However , I still remember that the misery begun in January 1992 , when the first democratic elections in Algeria - still in the name of democracy - were prevented by a military coup .
<en> I also remember that the Socialist NLF dictatorship in Algeria after decolonization was literally swamped by French and European support and by expressions of praise from the so-called intelligentsia in Europe .
<en> It is these socialists who have changed Algeria in less than thirty years from a relatively rich and prosperous country into a backward developing country with great poverty , where millions of people see the only way out through Islamic fundamentalism .
<en> As things are at the moment , I do not believe that Europe has a big part to play in that country .
<en> As European politicians , we have no lessons to teach the Algerians .
<en> We must , on the contrary , ensure that the Islamic advance does not strike our own continent .
<en> I wish my fellow Members of Parliament were as motivated about that as they are about possible trips to Algeria .
<en> Moorhouse report ( A4-259 / 97 )
<sp>
<en> Faced with the problems raised by the creation of balanced economic relations between the European Union and Japan , it was desirable to evaluate these ties .
<en> Regarding the current state of these relations , I share the opinion of the committee 's rapporteur .
<en> Having said that , while I approve the moves which ultimately should strengthen and balance our trade relations with Japan , I am worried about one of the points that affect deregulation .
<en> I fear that the latter is decidedly against our Community interests .
<en> I refer to the textile industry in which firms must apply existing legislation - often ignored by the competition that is slow to enforce it .
<en> The automotive sector would probably be one of the first to suffer the effects of deregulation applied rigorously by the European Union .
<en> The automotive industry - one of Europe 's industrial mainstays - will have to undergo restructuring in the next ten years .
<en> We should be mindful of the consequences that may prove disastrous for jobs in this sector , indeed for its very future .
<en> I approve this communication but I will remain vigilant over the enactment of this new approach towards Japan by opposing any hasty move , any unbridled liberalism and above all any step taken to impose rules and constraints upon us which will be ignored by the competition .
<sp>
<en> We have abstained from voting on the report on ' Europe and Japan : the next steps ' by Mr Moorhouse .
<en> We are in favour of developing and improving relations between the EU and Japan .
<en> However , we believe that the report only concentrates on economics and trade without showing any interest at all in important areas such as culture and the environment .
<en> As far as the trade issues are concerned , we are critical of many of Japan 's technical trade barriers , but we can sympathise with the existence of state monopolies .
<en> We do not share the report 's positive view of Japan 's participation in UN forces , but instead share the critical view of the Japanese peace movement .
<en> For these reasons we have chosen to abstain .
<sp>
<en> A rapprochement between the EU and Japan is positive .
<en> Human rights , international peace , relations with China , Russia and Korea , questions of nuclear weapons , the environment , trade , deregulation and the WTO are important areas of cooperation .
<en> I have also voted yes to the report in the hope that the endless talk of competition between the EU , the USA and Japan can be toned down in favour of cooperation and dialogue .
<en> Garosci report ( A4-254 / 97 )
<sp>
<en> The Commission Green Paper and the rapporteur recognize that the commercial sector is the second largest employer in the European Union , since it employs more than 22 million people and concerns 35 % of the total number of businesses , most of which are small and medium-sized businesses .
<en> Anyone considering the general orientational framework of the Commission may realise that the general trend in the restructuring of the sector forebodes negative developments , chiefly for small businesses , whilst at the same time speeding up already existing processes of consolidation and thus paving the way for the creation and domination of oligopolies and the control of commerce by certain large groups of multinational companies .
<en> This will turn out to be disastrous both for employment , since it will mean a significant loss of jobs and the imposition of part time employment , and for the protection of consumers who , once again , will become the victims of unrestrained competition and of the laws of a notorious free market .
<en> Nor is the widespread expansion of new technology for the modernisation of the provision of services and for the facilitation of new forms of direct transactions a panacea .
<en> The appearance and expansion of electronic distance selling could lead to the exclusion of large sections of the population and chiefly in remote , disadvantaged island and mountain regions where the levels of development are low and where , of course , there is no access to such networks of communication .
<en> The development of such networks without appropriate planning , without the development of appropriate infrastructures and without the most effective safety measures could irreparably damage the social and economic fabric of these regions , condemning them to lasting decline and underdevelopment and excluding them from the marketplace .
<en> Neither the consumer nor the person employed in the sector , neither the self-employed person nor the small businessperson can gain from competition between commercial monopolies and from the abolition of any form of control .
<en> What is needed is a joint plan of economic action for the common interest of both working people and consumers .
<en> We need to institute measures of labour control in the commercial sector .
<en> There need to be in operation , both at the grass-roots level and in large commercial enterprises of the European Union , workers ' supervisory councils for issues relating to pricing , expansion , labour relations and wages , and for issues relating to environmental and consumer protection .
<en> At the same time rules and regulations need to be laid down to prevent the unchecked activity of large multinational companies , large-scale mergers , buy outs , and the creation of monopolies in the commercial sector .
<en> Regulations need to be instituted that serve working people and consumers on issues of working hours and quality standards .
<en> In this regard there needs to be a fundamental debate and an exchange of views with the masses of working people and of small and medium-sized companies .

<sp>
<2en> Mr Commissioner , I am having some difficulty with what you are telling us .
<2en> Toy safety is regulated by a guideline from 1988 , in which it is stipulated that the Commission shall ensure by 1989 that the appropriate technical standards shall be enacted to guarantee this safety .
<2en> I ask you why it was only two years ago that the Commission applied to the CEN to set legal limits for organic chemical substances and plasticizers , which we are debating now .
<2en> And why , after two years , has this still not been done ?
<sp>
<en> There was a misunderstanding here , I feel , because what we are talking about here ...
<sp>
<en> Mr Flynn , it is not that I want to give permission to speak .
<en> But when you can understand the language in which the question is asked , you answer straight away , while I - being no polyglot - am still listening to the skilful work of the interpreters .
<en> That is why there has to be a short pause between the end of the question and your reply .
<en> The floor is yours .
<sp>
<en> I appreciate your point , Mr President .
<en> There must be no misunderstanding .
<en> What we are talking about here is the question about plasticizers in PVC toys .
<en> As far as the note I have here is concerned , we are talking about the fact that this group has been set up to deal specifically with the complaints that have been received .
<en> As soon as the opinion has been received the matter will be addressed .
<en> But the complaints have been dealt with in so far as the importer or the distributor has withdrawn the product , so there is no danger consequently .
<en> Concerning the Member States where it has been contested , you are quite right , because there are differences in testing procedures .
<en> It is precisely to do that and to harmonize the testing procedures that the working group is sitting to deal with the matter .
<sp>
<en> Mr Flynn , I think Mr Martin wants to put a supplementary question .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I do not doubt that the Council will be able to act in the way indicated by the honourable gentleman .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , thank you for your clear statement .
<2en> We have not always heard such clear statements in this Chamber on this subject , and I also thank you for what the Council has defined not long ago as the common attitude on this question .
<2en> But I wanted to ask additionally , what about efforts to form treaty relationships with Cuba - even membership of the ACP has been mentioned - and what part is played by questions of human rights and freedom of belief and conscience in this context .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Posselt .
<en> I am sure you realize that your supplementary question is well outside the scope of Mr Robles Piquer 's original question .
<en> Therefore , it is up to Mr Juncker whether he replies or not .
<en> Mr Juncker , the floor is yours , to use as you see fit .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the Council defined its Cuba policy in the common statement of 2 December 1996 .
<2en> The questions which you have raised will have to be answered in the context of the implementation of what was said there .

<en> According to information from the French Association of Language Teachers , the National Union of Secondary School Teachers and the Toulouse Regional Classics Teaching Association , moves are being made by the French Minister of Education , Claude Allegre , to abolish the teaching of ancient Greek as part of the educational reforms scheduled for the beginning of 1998 .
<en> Ancient Greek is currently taught to 1.9 % of pupils in certain secondary school classes while Latin is taught to 25.4 % .
<en> Despite reassurances from the Minister of Education , these rumours are still giving cause for concern .
<en> While educational curricula are the responsibility of the Member States , action to improve the teaching of European languages is one of the priorities of the European Union .

<en> Mr Falconer , I understand that the President in the Chair yesterday did not give you the floor every time you asked for it .
<en> But it has been noted in the Minutes that you did not participate in the vote every time .
<en> So , in practice , the result was exactly the same .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I just wish to state that I was here yesterday but did not vote .
<en> On page 22 , Mr Cassidy pointed out that the members of this group would not be voting in the final vote .
<en> My name is not included in the list of Members in the Minutes .
<en> I would ask you to correct that , please .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , one of the troubles with this procedure is that it draws attention to the fact that Members attend the votes because they are paid for it but they do not attend the debates .
<en> I refer to the Minutes last night .
<en> If Members had attended the debate last night on the final report , which was my report on landfill , they would have heard the Commissioner say that she was reluctant to give in full her speech with all the opinions of the Commission on the amendments tabled by Members of this House because it was late and she was rather tired .
<en> That is not good enough .
<en> Mr President , I would like you , if you could , to communicate with the Commissioner this morning to say that before we vote at 12.00 noon , it is essential that the Commission makes known to me , as rapporteur , to the committee chairmen and to all Members of this House exactly what its view was on the amendments tabled by Parliament .
<en> It is not enough that the Commissioner should say that she was tired and therefore unable to speak to us .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Jackson , I take note of your comment .
<en> You are of course aware - and there is no need for me to remind you , since you are an old and experienced colleague - that if we cannot have that explanation , it is open to you , as rapporteur , to react .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , on the same point in the Minutes .
<en> As somebody who was there throughout the debate on Mrs Jackson 's report last night and who was the last person to leave the Chamber , I do not recall those words from the Commissioner .
<en> I suggest to Mrs Jackson that if she is really doing her job as rapporteur , all she has to do is to ask for the Commissioner 's speaking note .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I asked a very specific question .
<en> I asked Sir Leon Brittan to shed some light on the procedure because there might be a conflict of interest between the European Communities and the Member States that want to become partners .
<en> I would like to know about a decision procedure .
<en> Will there be unanimity in the Council on this before signing , or is it possible that there is ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> I thought I had answered the question .
<en> There has to be unanimous support of the Member States and there has to be assent given by this Parliament , as I said in my speech .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.

<sp>
<en> It is widely recognized that the move towards a single market is something which should be unstoppable and is certainly desirable within the Union .
<en> We all have an obligation to try to do what we can to remove obstacles .
<en> But the tax regimes are quite different in every Member State .
<en> In the perception of moves which can be made toward a single market , at the moment those regimes are outside of that .
<en> That is a political reality .
<en> I am sure the honourable Member will recognize there is not any great prospect of any major change in the immediate political future .
<en> One can never talk about the very long term .
<en> I would be very stupid to try to predict the way in which opinion will move .

<en> Question No 11 by Liam Hyland ( H-0202 / 98 )
<en> Subject : Wool
<en> In April 1996 , the European Parliament unanimously adopted a motion calling for the development of a European wool industry .
<en> Has the Council now had an opportunity to examine the proposals contained in this motion and , if so , will the Council now initiate discussions with the Commission with a view to taking practical steps to realize the potential which exists for the development of a European wool industry ?
<sp>
<en> First of all , the answer is no .
<en> But the honourable Member will be aware that wool is not included in Annex II of the Treaty of Rome and is therefore not considered as an agricultural product .
<en> Consequently there are no direct European Union support systems for wool and no common organization of the market .
<en> Any amendment to the Treaty to designate wool as an agricultural product would be difficult to achieve and would require the agreement of all Member States .
<en> Assistance is already available for wool producers from the Union 's Structural Funds programmes .
<en> This assistance is conditional on the project meeting the aims and objective of the relevant programme , on its not duplicating funding already available from European Union sources , and on conformity with the state aid rules .
<sp>
<en> Is the President-in-Office aware that failure to address the issue of promoting a quality sustainable EU wool sector is to concede the European wool industry to our competitors , New Zealand and Australia ?
<en> Is he aware that his colleague , Mr Cunningham , gave an undertaking to Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that he was prepared to have the matter re-examined ?
<en> Is the President-in-Office aware that the Council can change the designation of wool as an agricultural product ?
<en> I am asking him today if he is prepared to at least put that item on the agenda for consideration by the Council so that the matter can be progressed .
<sp>
<en> At the moment this is not on the agenda of the Council .
<en> Any change would require unanimity .
<en> It would be up to a Member of the Council to make representations to the Presidency to ask that a matter like this be placed on the agenda so that a discussion can take place on the way forward and whether any changes should be introduced .
<en> At the moment I have not had that approach .
<en> If I did receive that approach then the matter would be given consideration .
<en> But at the moment there are no plans for any change in current regulations .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would only like to focus on the fact that in the speeches that related to the subject of copper there was no intention of changing the limit value of copper , but its classification , from B to C. We all fully agree on its limit value .
<sp>
<en> That , Mrs Matikainen-Kallström , seems to me to be more of a comment than a question .
<en> I therefore think we must let it pass , but Mrs Baldi also has a question she would like to put .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to know whether the Commission believes it is right to include copper among the chemical products , or rather the poisons , such as arsenic , cyanide , mercury and lead , despite the fact that the WHO has declared that a level of 2 milligrams of copper per litre of drinking water provides an adequate level of safety .
<sp>
<2en> I would simply like to ask the Commissioner if she realizes the impact her decision may have with regard to copper .
<2en> In very many countries , we currently have water mains pipes made from copper .
<2en> By classifying these pipes in the same way as arsenic , you could mislead people into thinking that they are dangerous .
<2en> I think this is particularly serious .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , on the basis of what the Commissioner has said , I have a written text from competent organizations to the effect that the 1997 revision of the WTO accepted that there was no scientific basis for the rumoured acute effects on health of copper in drinking water and described the recommendation which it had made at that time as provisional .
<2en> And , to finish my question , that same Commission , in document COM ( 94 ) 612 , accepted that the use of materials from copper in the water distribution system was not in itself harmful to the public health .
<2en> I would therefore like to know , since , from what the Commissioner said , she gave different answers without answering my question : is what I gathered from the documents wrong ?
<2en> Does it not stand up to scrutiny ?
<2en> Or perhaps the Commissioner was not fully informed and answered in that way in order to stick to the fact that she did not accept the amendments , in other words to transfer copper from 1B to 1C , and remained silent with regard to the failure to mention asbestos as one of the dangerous materials .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Madam President-in-Office of the Council , I still have three further supplementary questions on this issue , which will bring us to the end of Question Time .
<en> However , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , as you will see , when we give the floor to the Habsburgs in this House , we do so in chronological order , that is , to the eldest first and then the youngest .
<en> So Mr von Habsburg now has the floor for a supplementary question .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , allow me to say how heartening it is to see you in this position .
<2en> My question is as follows : do you not agree that it would be intrinsically more correct if we were also to address the issue of political representation when dealing with problems of nationality and language , because without the political representation , no regulation will ever be fully effective ?
<2en> And do you not agree that when it comes to the rights of these ethnic minorities , there should be a special focus on the political representation of these groups , because - the way I see it - the system which has been adopted in Belgium constitutes the best solution .
<2en> If we look at the German Cantons of Mr Grosch , who was elected with 16 000 votes , while I - as has been pointed out to me - needed 980 , 000 votes to get elected , then I consider it quite fair and equitable that we should ultimately recognize that there is more to this than counting heads .
<2en> I shall finish in a moment ; just a few more words , Mr President .
<2en> I just want to say that groups really are as important as individuals as regards rights within the Community .
<2en> Thank you very much , Mr President .
<2en> ( Laughter )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mr von Habsburg , I too am delighted to be addressing you in your new capacity .
<2en> Perhaps in this instance I can make an exception and give a personal answer .
<2en> Personally , I think you are quite right .
<2en> Of course this matter is something which we should look into further , and we can get our cue from Article 128 - which I cited earlier - namely the first section , which states that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore .
<2en> As I indicated earlier , however , it is up to the Commission to table a proposal here .
<2en> Then the Council can become involved too .
<sp>
<en> The President-in-Office has dealt very fully and sympathetically with this question .
<en> I come from a part of the Community where we have an ancient and very rich living language but it is at some risk .
<en> The European Union 's efforts to support this minority language are immensely appreciated .
<en> In the past the European Union has been criticized on the grounds that it is going to be a great melting pot in which small communities and minorities will all be lost .
<en> I would point out that , in the past , the individual states and kingdoms which now compose the European Union persecuted and tried to stamp out these minorities , but the European Union now supports them and gives them practical assistance in the form of a budget and , in the case of Ireland , a minority language office in Dublin .
<en> Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it is very appropriate that the European Union should engage in this political activity in order to make the point that we do not want to destroy but to support and maintain minority cultures and languages ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Mr McCartin , allow me to repeat that the European Union naturally seeks to protect all particularist and minority groups and takes an interest in all the various languages .
<2en> It is incorrect to say that support is given to groups which seek to exert a negative influence here .
<2en> As I have already pointed out , the starting point is the aforesaid Article 128 of the Treaty , which states quite clearly that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore .
<2en> I believe that is the correct intention and that is how we shall be proceeding in future .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I agree with Mr De Coene and Mrs Green that Amendment No 18 is actually an addition , and I would like the House to have a chance to vote on it .
<sp>
<en> Let us be quite clear .
<en> This is a compromise which covers all Members ' entitlements with regard to travel .
<en> There is even a paragraph referring to Annex 2 , which has been adopted , stating all this and calling on the Bureau to take a decision on this basis .
<en> We cannot add something to it which did not form part of the compromise .
<en> I am not going to put the text to the vote , because I believe it conflicts with the compromise .
<en> When a compromise is put forward , it has to be respected , and the amendment would add a new element to the calculation of journeys .
<en> I do not know whether or not it conflicts with Article 1 of Annex 2 , which governs the reimbursement of duly substantiated expenses , but in any event it deals with the same subject .
<en> I am very sorry , but that is my interpretation of the Rules of Procedure , Mrs Green , and I cannot allow this amendment .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , when my group presented that compromise text to you , on behalf of ourselves and the Liberals , we sent your services a letter which I am sure is there on your table .
<en> It listed all the amendments that the compromise was intended to replace .
<en> There is a sentence at the end which says it does not replace Amendment No 18 from the PSE , which should be voted separately .
<en> It has always been clear that was to be a separate vote , and I would ask you , please , to put it to the vote .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Green , the compromise amendment covers all the aspects raised .
<en> I stand by my interpretation .
<en> If you table a compromise amendment we cannot take an amendment which overlaps with this compromise .
<en> I am sorry , but that is my opinion .
<en> If you want , I can submit that to the Rules Committee but I am not going to put it to the vote
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to comment briefly on the fact that Mrs Green has just praised the President .
<2en> I do not believe we have any cause to praise either the President or ourselves after three hours of voting .
<2en> I think we have delivered a miserable example of the way in which the European Parliament goes about its legislative work : three hours of bartering with amendments across the floor of the House .
<2en> That is the quality we are providing .
<2en> I find it sad to see what is happening here this morning .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I would like to remind you that in its sitting on 16 September , Parliament postponed the final vote on Mrs Pack ' s report on this matter .
<2en> Pack ( PPE ) , rapporteur .
<2en> ( DE ) Madam President , I should like to ask that we reject the request for urgent debate .
<2en> During the last part-session of Parliament , we did not see any requests for urgent debate because we still wanted to give the Council and the Commission the opportunity to have a proper look at our amendments and to also evaluate them and perhaps even comply with them .
<2en> It is not acceptable that , during the summer recess , we should , in no time at all , have responded to the Council ' s request by producing a report , and that the Council should then not even have taken note of what we had proposed by way of amendments , let alone thought of complying with them .
<2en> We expect that , by the time of the next part-session in October , the Council will have told us which of our amendments it has accepted and which it has not .
<2en> At the last part-session in Brussels , Chris Patten told us that he too would examine these proposals and would then present one of his own .
<2en> I believe that if , by means of its proposals , Parliament is speaking up for more efficiency in spending tax revenue , the Council should not do the opposite .
<2en> If , in fact , money ever disappears or gets lost in the wheels of administration , then it is always the Commission which is to blame and never the Council .
<2en> We should like , as this agency gets off the ground , for everything really to be perfectly clear , for the administration to be stringent , for the headquarters of the Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki to be closely linked to the headquarters of the Stability Pact ( also in Thessaloniki ) and for the Kosovo Agency to be an operational component of this in Kosovo .
<2en> We also want the administrative structures to be so strict that the processes through which money is spent are precisely visible .
<2en> I should like here to contradict anyone who maintains that reconstruction in Kosovo will not be possible if we do not take a vote here today .
<2en> That is nonsense .
<2en> The EU Commission ' s Task Force is already working in the area itself .
<2en> It is doing this and , ladies and gentlemen , you all know very well that the Commission never pays up very quickly and that we cannot therefore say : today it issues its instructions and tomorrow it pays .
<2en> It can confer the assignment today , and when , in October , the amount required has been estimated , it will then pay , perhaps in November or December at the earliest - as always , unfortunately , very belatedly .
<2en> We are not the ones who are impeding the reconstruction of Kosovo .
<2en> It is the Council which will be doing this if it does not soon follow us on the path that we have embarked upon here .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee agrees with Mrs Pack ' s remarks .
<2en> The Council ' s decision is also not anticipated for this week , so that no delay is to be expected .
<2en> What is more , neither the Committee nor Parliament has yet received an official response from the Council to our representations .
<2en> For this reason , I would ask that the request for urgent debate be rejected .
<2en> ( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The article of the previous directive still applies here , according to which self-employed share fishermen are subject to national legislation as regards their licences and choice of working conditions .
<2en> The directive concerns only fishermen in an employer-employee relationship .
<sp>
<en> I was just saying that the issue is whether fishermen of that kind are regarded as employed or not .
<en> This is critical to us and the Commission has still omitted to answer the question .
<sp>
<2en> I shall repeat , although I feel I was quite clear : the working practices of self-employed share fishermen are defined by national legislation .
<2en> We are talking here of a specific employer-employee relationship .
<2en> I do not believe I can provide further clarification .
<sp>
<en> I would just like clarification as to when the Commissioner believes the conciliation process on the junior doctors will commence .
<en> Obviously , this is of great concern .
<en> I accept her point that there will probably have to be compromise on all sides but I would be interested to know when she anticipates conciliation starting .
<sp>
<2en> The conciliation process will begin over the next four months .
<2en> It will certainly depend on the Council and on the developments following on from the discussion in Council .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Madam President , yesterday 's Minutes in the English also seem to indicate that they were the Minutes of Thursday 17 December .
<en> I am sure that Parliament would not be writing today 's Minutes before we have actually had our debates and votes .
<en> I hope that will be corrected .
<sp>
<en> No , of course , I can assure you immediately that that is not the case .
<en> It is indeed an error .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I want to refer to your expression of sympathy with the people of France who are affected by severe flooding .
<en> It was very appropriate that you should raise this matter yesterday morning .
<en> But you not only expressed sympathy , you also requested the Commission to provide some assistance .
<en> Sometimes in Parliament the right hand does not know what the left one is doing .
<en> A couple of years ago we took away the possibility of extending assistance to people in such instances in the European Union .
<en> We expressed the same sympathy with the Greeks and requested the same assistance , but there is no money available .
<en> We ought therefore in future to either provide the money and the conditions under which it is paid or cease to ask the Commission to give assistance .
<en> What we gave the Greeks was an empty cup .
<en> We are offering the same thing to the people of France .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr McCartin .
<en> Indeed , I had to mention the same problem when opening yesterday ' s sitting .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would like to table a procedural motion .
<2en> I failed to notice that we had moved on from the procedural motions to the report .
<2en> I would like to raise a minor motion on something that could be deemed insignificant , but as each day passes , I get increasingly frustrated at the crazy amounts of paper being wasted in this establishment .
<2en> It is not just a lot of energy on words that is being wasted here , there is an incredible amount of paper wasted and there is no sign of any kind of recycling scheme .
<2en> At the other Parliament based in Brussels , we at least have cardboard boxes where we can deposit the massive amounts of paper which we no longer need .
<2en> At this end , despite the ultra-modern and sophisticated design of this building , I have as yet been unable to detect the existence of such practical , inexpensive cardboard boxes which can play a key role in the recycling of paper .
<2en> I would like to ask you to make a little effort here .
<2en> Surely , the budget could stretch to a few cardboard boxes for the Members where we can stock paper for recycling purposes .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Vander Taelen , for this contribution which is indeed not strictly relevant to the Minutes .
<en> But that does not matter .
<en> It is a perfectly valid point which I shall pass on to the College of Quaestors this very day to see if we can find appropriate solutions to the problem you have brought up .
<en> ( The Minutes were adopted )
