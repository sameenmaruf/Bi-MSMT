<2en> Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
<2en> The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
<2en> Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
<2en> The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
<2en> I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations , although I would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and modules had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .
<2en> This , however , does not seem feasible .
<2en> Finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
<2en> I should like to make just a few comments .
<2en> Firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .
<2en> Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
<2en> This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
<2en> My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
<2en> In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules .
<2en> However , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
<2en> I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
<2en> Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
<2en> My third point has also been mentioned already .
<2en> As you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
<2en> We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .
<2en> But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .
<2en> We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .
<2en> The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .
<2en> Very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .
<2en> As Mr Simpson has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .
<2en> The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
<2en> In this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels , which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of Austria , is doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .
<2en> In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
<2en> Margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
<2en> Therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
<2en> Finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
<2en> This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .
<2en> But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
<2en> As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
<2en> I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I had not expected to speak today because I represent the south-east of England which is one of the more prosperous regions of England and of Europe .
<en> We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive .
<en> We have no Objective 1 funding .
<en> What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out .
<en> So , why do I speak ?
<en> Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation .
<en> In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight , a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68 % GDP per head of the European average - a very poor region .
<en> It gets no support from Europe .
<en> Why not ?
<en> It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire .
<en> Hampshire is a prosperous county - 100 % of European average so , no money for the Isle of Wight .
<en> Yet , it has a population of 130 000 , a bigger population than the Åland Islands which are NUTS II and do get grants from the European Union .
<en> The island has taken its case against the British Government that it feels is treating it unfairly , to the High Court in London .
<en> I think they might win that case .
<en> As far as Europe is concerned , on my advice , they took their case to the Ombudsman because we believed that EUROSTAT , by refusing to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , was treating the island unfairly .
<en> This week , in what I would say is a landmark ruling by the European Ombudsman , he has said that constitutes maladministration by EUROSTAT and by the European Commission .
<en> Let me read out his ruling : " In the present case the Commission has not provided the Ombudsman with elements which show that EUROSTAT , when deciding not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , has taken into account all relevant factors including Article 158 of the Treaty and the Viola report of the European Parliament " .
<en> He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem .
<en> I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again , that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island .
<en> Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union .
<sp>
<en> - Mr President , Tony Blair and Donald Dewar will not have slept well last night !
<en> Their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality .
<en> The Labour Party heartlands of Scotland have sent them an unmistakable message .
<en> The Scottish Labour voter - for so long taken for granted - has spoken .
<en> The Scottish Conservative Party candidate in Ayr , John Scott , has humiliated Labour into third place - 5 000 or more votes behind .
<en> This will only get worse for Labour when the truth about their incompetent and cynical administration of the European Union 's Structural Funds becomes better known and better understood .
<en> Because of the Labour Government 's tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year , it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects .
<en> Scottish local authorities are left not knowing whether or not the projects which they are having to underwrite will indeed obtain Structural Fund support .
<en> Commissioner : three questions :
<en> When do you expect to be able to provide certainty for the Scottish regions and the badly needed projects which are looking for EU support ?
<en> Are you satisfied with the preparedness of the Scottish Executive to provide the necessary matching funding and to assure you that it is truly additional ?
<en> Or is it all just the usual Labour / Liberal coalition hot air , all mouth , while feet drag along the cobbled streets of Edinburgh and European money is hijacked by the Treasury in London ?
<sp>
<en> I have listened carefully to this interesting debate and I will transmit all the questions which were raised here to my colleague , Mr Barnier , and he will respond accordingly .
<en> I am sure he will send you his replies at least to all those issues which concern Structural Funds and additionality .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , inevitably Commissioner Liikanen was not in a position other than to reply formally to the debate and say that he had heard what had been said and would pass it on .
<en> That is not very satisfactory from the point of view of the many Members of this House who made important points .
<en> I request that Mr Barnier gives a written summary of his response to these points .
<sp>
<en> I am sure that Commissioner Barnier will be willing to follow up on this interesting debate .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on 11 April .

<en> I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 30 March 2000 .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , for the past six months to a year , the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been calling on the Commission to do something about the drought in Ethiopia .
<en> Nothing has been done although there was an instant reaction from the Commission when the fact that 12 million people are under threat of famine in Ethiopia came to public attention .
<en> I suggest that this week , as a matter of urgency , Commissioner Nielson be called to this House to explain the delay by the European Union in responding to a drought that has been continuing for the past three years .
<en> We seem to be able to get weapons there for the Eritreans and Ethiopians to continue the war of aggression against each other over nonsensical issues and , at the same time , while the European Union and the Western World export weapons to Ethiopia and to Eritrea , the famine continues and the lives of millions and millions of people are threatened .
<en> I have been in this House since 1984 , and rarely have I seen such neglect - such wilful neglect - by the European Union in dealing with a famine of this kind that we knew was on our doorstep .
<en> It is a great shame that every time an issue like this is raised with Commissioner Nielson , or raised with the Commission , he passes it off as if it did not matter - as if he did not believe this was happening .
<en> Commissioner Nielson must come to this House and explain his use of PR men and spin doctors in this disgraceful display of neglect .
<en> Despite statements to the contrary , they can most certainly get two billion dollars ' worth of weapons into the conflict in Ethiopia and Eritrea .
<en> The whole issue is a reflection on the inability of this House to act .
<sp>
<en> Mr Andrews , there is of course no need to start a debate on the subject .
<en> I should just like to point out that in a few moments the House will be voting on whether to add another item to the ' Human Rights ' section and one of the proposals made by two groups is specifically to do with the problem of the famine in Ethiopia .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , as many of us know , last Friday saw the inauguration in Vienna of the Monitoring Centre for Racism , Xenophobia and Antisemitism .
<2en> I would like to thank you for your forceful intervention .
<2en> At this very important juncture , you said that racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are totally incompatible with the defence of human rights and the dignity of the human person .
<2en> You stated this very clearly and powerfully and thus sent a message of confidence to the people of Austria and to all the other peoples of Europe .
<2en> Many MEPs , representing almost all the Parliamentary groups and many of the Member States , were present , as of course were many Austrian MEPs and the President of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights , Graham Watson .
<2en> They all asked me - and I am very willing to act as their messenger - to thank you for your speech , which made us proud to be Members of this House .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Imbeni , for your extremely kind words .
<en> I would like to tell all the Members of Parliament who attended this moving and very important ceremony how well I believe we all represented the European Parliament , and I know that none of the participants failed to notice our attendance in large numbers .
<en> I believe it was very important for this House .
<en> Thank you , Mr Imbeni , for your comments .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr Gollnisch , You have exceeded your allocated speaking time .
<en> You yourself said that you were asking for a minute and a half in which to make your point of order .
<en> Mr Le Pen , who will be heard tomorrow in the Committee on Legal Affairs , will explain the whole case and we will do things in complete accordance with the regulations .
<en> I really cannot let you speak any longer .
<en> It is quite out of the question .
<en> This is not the time to debate this matter , Mr Gollnisch .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , you have given the floor three times to Mr Barón Crespo , although these interventions were not tabled on the agenda .
<2en> I ask you to give me a few seconds in which to finish what I have to say .
<2en> ( Mixed reactions )
<2en> If you have any respect for your position and for the rights of Members ...
<sp>
<en> I have the greatest respect for my position .
<en> You yourself said that you were requesting a minute and a half in order to make your point of order .
<en> That time is up .
<en> Mr Le Pen will explain the entire matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs tomorrow .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , before you take the final vote , Amendment No 3 to paragraph 28 is on the voting list as by the TDI Group .
<en> I should like to make it absolutely clear that is not the case because our group would certainly not want to be seen to be supporting an amendment by the TDI Group .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , first of all , this technical amendment has been voted upon , and I do not see why we have to come back to it .
<en> Let me point out that the rapporteur belongs to the TDI group and that consequently the honourable Member cannot complain .
<sp>
<en> That is exactly what was on my list .
<en> The amendment has been voted upon as I announced it .
<en> We now come to the final vote .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am merely trying to clarify - and this does not have to be done now , it can be done later - whether the amendment was tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members or by the rapporteur .
<2en> This makes a difference and affects the way we vote .
<2en> I would be grateful if this could be clarified afterwards , because we voted on the assumption that this was not a TDI amendment , but an amendment tabled by the rapporteur .
<sp>
<en> I would like to make it quite clear that this amendment was tabled by the TDI group , and was voted by plenary .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Is that what you said yesterday , Mr Berthu ?
<sp>
<2en> Absolutely , Madam President , those were the remarks I made yesterday and they do not appear in the Minutes .
<sp>
<en> Very well , we shall amend the Minutes so that your remarks are properly reported .
<en> You have jumped ahead rather , but we are still on the Minutes .
<en> That being the case , we will be able to save time later on .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , with a view to clarifying the situation , allow me to say the following : yesterday , as we all know , there was great confusion here in the Chamber , and I do not wish to reopen the debate on the issue itself at this stage .
<2en> However , the reason why it was suggested that we should not debate this report on the status of political parties was in fact that it was said that it did not have a legal base .
<2en> In this respect it is right , however - as you said - that the relevant provision is Rule 143 of our Rules of Procedure .
<2en> Now the impression has been given that I and my colleagues thought that the report ought to be referred back to the committee ; this has arisen from the fact that we mistook the number of the rule in the Rules of Procedure , and after all to err is human .
<2en> The relevant provision was Rule 143 .
<2en> That is why there can be a vote straight away on whether we address this report or not .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I have since read up on exactly what was written in the Minutes about the incident involving the demonstrators .
<2en> I would like to make something clear .
<2en> During the sitting , three demonstrators carrying banners entered the Chamber .
<2en> That is what it says .
<2en> I have to tell you that these three people did not make their way into the Chamber calmly , but sneaked in quickly , and they had not unfurled the banners at that stage .
<2en> They did not do this until they were in the Chamber , and our staff were unable to see them .
<2en> I simply wanted to say this , because as it is minuted here , one could assume that the staff should have noticed the fact that they were carrying banners .
<2en> That was not the case .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , from what I have heard , there have been two interventions against and none in favour .
<sp>
<en> The comments made by Mrs Maes strongly reinforce the fact that the two items could both be dealt with , as I myself also said .
<en> The situation of the Afghan refugees requesting asylum in Australia is already on the agenda , under ' Human Rights ' .
<en> So , we will certainly be holding a debate on this issue , in any event .
<en> So , how shall we deal with this ?
<en> I think that we must take clear action and withdraw the item on foot-and-mouth disease from the agenda .
<en> Fine .
<en> I shall put to the vote the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
<en> ( Parliament rejected the request )
<en> Regarding the sittings of 19 and 20 September in Brussels : There are no amendments .
<en> Speeches relating to procedure
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , on behalf of our group , I should like to ask you personally a question .
<2en> In connection with the Macedonian peace proposal , the Macedonian parliament must hold a debate as a matter of urgency .
<2en> Would you address the president of that parliament ?
<2en> We are all hoping for broad parliamentary support for the peace proposals , but this will not happen without any effort .
<2en> Parliament has a major role to play .
<2en> Hence our request to you to ask the president of the parliament , in a letter or message , to discuss this peace proposal as a matter of urgency .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Maes , the response that I am going to give you will , I believe , exceed your expectations .
<en> I am in fact going to visit Macedonia in a few days ' time , at the very request of all those people who are involved in this matter and who hoped that the President of the European Parliament would go to Macedonia , because this Parliament , I think it is true to say , is very well regarded and this certainly is a most encouraging sign .
<en> Naturally , as soon as I can , I shall give you further details about this invitation , which I have only just received .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , on Wednesday of last week an aircraft of the Binter Mediterranean company , which flies between Málaga and Melilla , crashed near Málaga airport killing four and injuring seventeen .
<2en> It is the second time in two years that the city of Melilla has suffered a tragedy of this nature .
<2en> On this occasion , thanks to the skill and professionalism of the pilots - one of whom died - almost all the passengers survived .
<2en> Madam President , I would ask you to communicate our feelings and our solidarity to the families of the victims and the injured , with the conviction that the European Commission and this Parliament are demonstrating their concern for the quality and maintenance of the safety of air transport , as the debate we are holding this very Tuesday will show , when the European Commission presents its reports on this subject .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place today , at 6.30 p.m.
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 6.05 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m. )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we have heard on the news that a Russian commercial airliner has crashed into the Black Sea .
<2en> It is not clear whether it was an explosion or whether the aeroplane was accidentally shot down by the Ukrainian army .
<2en> I think that before the start of this vote - regardless of what caused this tragic accident - we should briefly remember those who have lost their lives in this tragedy .
<sp>
<en> If you would be so kind , ladies and gentlemen , we will now observe a minute ' s silence for the victims .
<en> ( Parliament observed a minute ' s silence while remaining standing )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would first like to strike a critical note , because although the rapporteur explained the need for haste to the committee and I also understand that , I believe that there should not be fast-track procedures of this kind , because they can lead to botch-ups .
<2en> However , I would like to specifically exclude the rapporteur 's report from that comment .
<2en> I am totally in agreement with the content of the report , because approximation of Community law as it applies to SMEs is also absolutely necessary if we are to increase legal certainty for cross-border contracts , especially in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union .
<2en> It would be irresponsible to create free trade areas without making provision for the necessary instruments to keep commercial trade on track .
<2en> However , it is my belief , and this is something that Mr MacCormick just touched upon , that the mature traditions underpinning the legal systems of the Member States impose certain limitations on the approximation of civil and commercial law , and that a failure to respect those traditions would inevitably lead to the opposite of what we are trying to achieve .
<2en> However , I believe that these problems have been adequately addressed and that it is also possible to achieve this objective , which we will therefore be supporting .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Lehne , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to know how many legal transactions have taken place in the European Union during the last 15 minutes , while we have been debating .
<2en> Would it be a million , 10 million or even 100 million ?
<2en> Whatever , I believe that it must be a large figure .
<2en> We are in a world of what in German we call " Massengeschäfte " a term that is not perhaps particularly easy to translate into other languages - bread-and-butter transactions , perhaps .
<2en> I am sure that only a fraction of these legal transactions will have been cross-border , and I am equally sure that these transactions , ranging from Lapland to Sicily , from Scotland to Bavaria , will have been conducted according to totally different traditions and customs .
<2en> That is why we need to be clear that this is a very sensitive area and however ambitious we may be , we still need to proceed very carefully and prudently .
<2en> Mrs Wallis has already referred to the reaction in the United Kingdom , for example .
<2en> So I think it is reasonable for the Commission to propose in its Option II that we should initially work out some general legal principles .
<2en> One expert very appositely said that the problem with legal convergence is not so much the rules as the exceptions .
<2en> We have discovered precisely that through our own work , in the case of warranty periods on purchases , interest on arrears , money laundering and also the takeover directive .
<2en> General principles can be agreed quickly , but in contrast it is very difficult to harmonise which groups should be given special treatment and who qualifies for special protection .
<2en> That is why we also need to set reasonable priorities for our work .
<2en> The cross-border aspects should be prioritised in the first place .
<2en> We need to achieve compatibility between European legislation and national legislation , but national legislative provisions also need to be made compatible with each other .
<2en> Courts need to cooperate more effectively and mutual legal assistance needs to be guaranteed .
<2en> I believe that these are concrete , practical steps that we can implement from one day to the next , which would assist legal transactions between our citizens within the single market .
<2en> I think that in considering these matters , we should also deal with the concept of working towards a European law as an option for parties entering into contracts .
<2en> They could therefore choose either to opt for a legal system created in Europe or else continue to use national law .
<2en> As I see it , this would be a kind of soft harmonisation , setting in train a process of convergence which , Mr MacCormick , would be better than regulations adopted as an abrupt event , as Mrs Wallis put it .
<2en> Against this background I would also like to say that Mr Lehne 's draft does not , of course , reiterate the demands that we made in 1989 and 1994 .
<2en> At that time we demanded that a European Civil Code should be drawn up , but as far as I can see , that proposal has not been incorporated in the texts adopted in committee nor in the amendments .
<2en> We have adopted a good , reasonable and cautious approach here .
<2en> I would like to thank both the rapporteur and all those who helped with the hearing for their assistance .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , by and large I agree with the rapporteur , and in the limited time I have available I can only mention one or two rather unrelated points .
<2en> What we need to start with at EU level is coherent and homogeneous legislation .
<2en> That is very often not the case , because terms are used which have a different meaning in other legal texts .
<2en> Scarcely any academic research has been done into this aspect of Community law .
<2en> So the first thing we should do is to ensure coherence and homogeneity in our own legal texts , and I would urge you to set up an expert committee to do this .
<2en> That is one point .
<2en> The other point that I would like to address is how this relates to international civil law .
<2en> It seems to me that Mr Lehne has rather neglected this aspect in his report .
<2en> International civil law can make an important contribution to overcoming the difficulties involved in cross-border legal disputes , and as a rule , and I am choosing my words very carefully now , international civil law is certainly not inferior to Community law , certainly as far as legal culture and the quality of legal texts are concerned .
<2en> So if , as in the case of the directive on electronic commerce , you take issue with international civil law , the situation becomes very difficult indeed .
<2en> We therefore need to examine once more to what extent we can retain international civil law .
<2en> My final point concerns national regulations .
<2en> I think this is an area where we should not overreach ourselves .
<2en> That will be very difficult .
<2en> I believe that it would be best for us to have convincing law making in the European Union .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to congratulate Parliament and especially the Committee on Legal Affairs and its rapporteur , Mr Lehne , on its timely report on the approximation of the civil and commercial laws of the Member States .
<en> Given the forthcoming European Council in December in Laeken , for which this report will be of relevance , I am particularly pleased that the European Parliament is discussing this report here today .
<en> The European Council will therefore have at its disposal not only the Commission 's communication and the Council 's report , but also the report by the European Parliament , which handles this important issue in the necessary depth .
<en> The Commission also very much welcomes the report as Parliament 's response to the Commission 's consultation process , launched by the communication on European contract law .
<en> It is absolutely essential that the Commission should get as much feedback and input as possible from the other EC institutions so that it can establish its future approach in the area of contract law .
<en> One fundamental question confronts the Commission , as well as Parliament and the Council as the two branches of the European legislature .
<en> Should we continue with the existing piecemeal approach of harmonising European contract law in a very sector-specific way , as has been done for the past 20 years , or should we adopt a new approach ?
<en> It is obvious that if the existing approach corresponds to the needs of the European Union then we should continue it .
<en> If , however , there are problems despite , or possibly even because of , the existing approach , then we should be brave enough to change it .
<en> It was in order to get a reply to this fundamental question that the Commission adopted its communication on European contract law .
<en> The choice of our future approach is highly important for the smooth functioning of the internal market and the participation of consumers , small- and medium-sized enterprises and all other economic operators , as well as for the uniform application of Community law .
<en> We have already received a large number of constructive comments and reactions which confirm that the Commission 's initiative is of great interest to all stakeholders .
<en> Of course not all the reactions point in the same direction , but this is inevitable with such a complex subject where so many issues are raised and different options need to be considered .
<en> The reactions will be examined in depth by the Commission .
<en> Obviously the Commission will attach great importance to Parliament 's response to our communication which , once you have adopted it , will be very carefully analysed .
<en> The Commission will decide what suggestions it will make in the light of the reports from Parliament and the Council , the possible reaction from the European Council and the responses to our consultation process .
<en> I understand that the Council may ask the Commission to report to the Community institutions and the public on the consultation process , together with any observations and recommendations if necessary in the form of a Green or White Paper , not later than 31 December 2002 .
<en> The European Parliament 's proposal for an action plan is particularly relevant in this context .
<en> The Commission has taken due note of the ambitious deadlines for specific steps to be taken .
<en> In conclusion , I would like to express the Commission 's thanks for the careful analysis that has gone into this report .
<en> If there are problems for the internal market and the uniform application of Community law which need to be tackled , it is obvious that whatever line we take this will be a longer term project of considerable importance .
<en> So , this is certainly not the last time that we will debate questions of European contract law in this House .
<en> I submitted the Commission communication to the college , together with my colleagues Mr Vitorino , Mr Bolkestein and Mr Liikanen .
<en> At the last Council meeting on the internal market and consumer affairs , I emphasised my strong personal interest in this matter , not only because I am convinced of its value but also because of my own professional background as a practising barrister and as international commercial arbitrator .
<en> For those who have expressed concern about the survival of the common law system : that is the system that I have worked in myself for 27 years and I have some attachment to it .
<en> Perhaps with that background it will be able to make sure that these issues and sensitivities are taken fully into account .
<en> This is an ambitious project but it is a feasible project .
<en> When I worked on contracts where arbitration was needed or on dispute had to be resolved , the " applicable law " was - lex mercatoria .
<en> What is that ?
<en> Those who have to enter into contracts with a term like that will feel perfectly comfortable with something a bit more rigid and rigorous , which is what all of us in this House are aiming at .
<en> My colleagues and I are therefore looking forward to constructive dialogue with Parliament and the other EC institutions in the future .

<2en> Madam President , on Wednesday , we are going to debate an item on cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism .
<2en> However , we discovered - on the Internet , in fact - that this debate is going to be based on an exchange of letters between a representative of Mr Bush - a Mr Forster , I believe - and Mr Prodi .
<2en> Parliament does not have a copy of these letters , although we can read them on the Internet , in which the United States government demands Europe take forty or so measures to cooperate with the fight against terrorism .
<2en> It also appears - we can only say ' it appears ' as we have no documents to refer to - that Mr Prodi sent a reply to the United States government at the end of November .
<2en> I think that , for this slightly rushed debate to be held in more favourable conditions - the debate is , however , scheduled for Wednesday - it would be helpful for Parliament to obtain a copy of the letter that the United States government sent to Mr Prodi and Mr Prodi ' s reply .
<2en> That is the request I would like to make .
<sp>
<en> Of course , Mr Krivine , we shall try to follow this up as soon as possible .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , this point may be of some interest to the House .
<en> Honourable Members may recall voting in the mini-part-session on the Foster report on common rules in the field of civil aviation security .
<en> This report had to be brought forward very quickly in the light of the events of 11 September .
<en> We were then awaiting the response from the Transport Council meeting last Friday and everyone hoped that a common position would be reached .
<en> I should like to inform the House that the Transport Council and Member States did not reach a common position , despite urgent appeals from all sides on the desperate need for these measures and despite the fact that this Parliament had bent over backwards to do its very best in a very short period of time .
<en> The behaviour of the Member States and the Council in all of this has been quite appalling .
<en> This is probably one of the most important measures that has come through since 11 September and it would have affected 38 European countries .
<en> I will keep this House informed as to progress but I would like you , Madam President , to pass on our comments to the presidency .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to draw your attention , Madam President , and that of Parliament , to the unacceptable and discriminatory behaviour of the Albanian authorities towards the Greek minority in the town of Chimara particularly , where , last week , special police forces demolished buildings , physically abused members of that minority , to whom the buildings belonged , even women and children .
<2en> The buildings included the minority ' s administrative headquarters , the infants ' school and several shops , which , on the pretext that they had been poorly constructed , were destroyed by bulldozers on the instructions of the town ' s mayor , whose election , it must be stressed , was not recognised as legitimate by Council of Europe observers .
<2en> Madam President , I think that Parliament should take on board these extremely regrettable actions when preparing for the forthcoming negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Albania .
<2en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , are we , the Members of the European Parliament , all fraudsters ?
<2en> Are we all thieves ?
<2en> Are we all idlers ?
<2en> Are we timewasters who do nothing from morning to night and spend our time enjoying ourselves and getting rich ?
<2en> I do not think so .
<2en> Yet that is what is stated in a book by an Italian journalist , Mario Giordano , entitled ' L ' Unione fa la truffa ' [ The Union is a swindler ] .
<2en> The title says it all .
<2en> This journalist is also , I regret to say , the director of a major Italian television company .
<2en> The book , which I found in a bookshop in Rome - where I had gone to meet my mother and sister as I often do - filled me with horror and sent shivers down my spine , for it describes all of us Members of Parliament as idlers who do nothing but plot frauds and robberies .
<2en> Madam President , please would you examine this book and instigate legal proceedings for libel against Mario Giordano , who , it pains me to admit , is Italian .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the launch of the notes and coins has finally made the euro a political reality for the 300 million people of Euroland .
<en> Coming from a country which is out , and a party which opposes joining , I was half expecting more glitches and popular resentment at the imposition of an unfamiliar currency .
<en> So far so good , with little inflationary rounding-up .
<en> I congratulate the ECB , the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting , although I still question the need for a EUR 500 note which can only facilitate criminality .
<en> The naturally cautious British Conservative position is that , although the euro may be an added convenience to travellers and improve price transparency in the single market , it is undoubtedly intended primarily to bolster pan-European identity as a stepping stone to further political integration - something admitted to by everybody bar Mr Blair and our Labour Government - and to control not only of monetary policy , but also of taxation .
<en> The " one size fits all " monetary policy , as the Commission 's pessimistic 2001 economic report admits , cannot be right for all of the countries all of the time and , coupled with the fiscal restraints of the Stability and Growth Pact , imposes severe destabilising problems and a lack of flexibility on certain economies , as we have already seen in the artificial boom scenario of Ireland .
<en> The risks of an asymmetric shock developing will only get bigger after enlargement as European labour markets remain unreformed and largely immobile .
<en> President Prodi has admitted this inherent risk and the call will come very shortly for a much bigger EU budget and direct EU taxes to set up bail-out funds to compensate affected countries for their loss of rights to devalue their currencies or lower their interest rates .
<en> Nevertheless , I wish the euro well as the currency of our major trading partners , since UK prosperity is also affected by its stability .
<en> I hope that my pessimistic prognosis , which echoes that of the Commission 's own , proves to be wrong over time .
<en> I would also like confirmation from Commissioner Solbes that , in his opinion , for the UK to join the euro it will have to spend at least two years locked into the ERM II phase first before proceeding .
<en> Finally , I should like to congratulate you , Mr President , on your election .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , first of all , I should like to thank all the speakers for their comments .
<en> I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years .
<en> We are sorry to see him leave the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , but we know that his skills will continue to help Parliament and the process of European integration in the Committee of Foreign Affairs .
<en> Karl von Wogau said , in a reference to Jacques Delors , that it is impossible to fall in love with the euro , and yet Christa Randzio-Plath said that Europe ' s citizens are happy .
<en> Both comments might be linked to one fundamental factor : the euro is the first aspect of European identity to affect all citizens of the Member States of the Monetary Union .
<en> The euro is extremely important , as were the removal of borders or the internal market , which , nevertheless , only affect goods and citizens crossing the border at a given time , but it is also a piece of our European identity , which we use every day from morning till night , in all the countries of the Monetary Union and exactly in the same conditions .
<en> Because there are clearly also striking differences between us , this aspect , out of all our common aspects , must be highlighted as a very positive one , as the others have nothing to do with any form of unification .
<en> From now on , the euro will give us notes and coins and a slight increase in economic growth , as a consequence of uncertainties being eliminated .
<en> It is true , however , and I am in agreement on this with some of the speakers , that the fundamental elements will emerge as a result of our potential capacity for growth or , to put it another way , as a result of implementing the Lisbon process in a more ambitious way than we have done so far .
<en> We will be able to break free from the United States , as Mr Ruffolo suggests we would want to do .
<en> Nevertheless , experience and the year 2001 have shown us that being relatively independent in terms of trade does not protect us from the effects of a crisis in the United States as a consequence of the course which takes place due to the economic effects arising from the relationships between companies and between financial markets .
<en> The exchange rate will be the real test of the euro .
<en> I have always said that the exchange rate was never an objective of the Union ' s policy .
<en> Our objective for monetary policy is to maintain low inflation and we are convinced that a currency with low inflation is , in the long term , a stable currency , a popular currency , a currency that will provide refuge and is a currency that will have an important role to play in the economic world .
<en> Apart from the purely economic aspects , however , what is happening with our institutional structure ?
<en> Is the euro the beginning of economic government ?
<en> I would say that the model we put together in Maastricht was based on a single monetary policy and on coordinated national economic policies .
<en> This is our model .
<en> And we have to work on ensuring that the euro is a success on this basis .
<en> I am not going to prejudge whether we should make more or less progress in the processes of political integration .
<en> It could be done according to the wishes of those that favour greater political integration , but I also realise that this is a decision to be taken by the fifteen Member States in other bodies , in other forums and following a different debate .
<en> Nevertheless , I am convinced that we can move ahead with the process of greater coordination between economic policies , which certainly does not mean the unification of our economic policies , because our situations are different and , consequently , policies must be applied consistently .
<en> Today , like so often before , we have tended to confuse stability pacts with economic policy guidelines .
<en> Is the Stability Pact the problem for the Union ' s economic policy ?
<en> This is something we have discussed on more than one occasion in this House .
<en> I repeat what I have always said : the Stability Pact is nothing more and nothing less than a necessary factor which allows us to maintain a policy mix between budgetary policy and monetary policy , which facilitates a monetary policy with low rates of interest .
<en> Structural changes to our economies and the move towards growth , coherence between our national economic policies and Union policy as a whole with monetary policy must be managed by means of these broad economic policy guidelines .
<en> We have the necessary instruments ; we have to perfect and improve them , but I think that the system is a good one .
<en> The policy mix will be one of the key elements of the Spanish Presidency , as the chairman of Ecofin stressed and I am sure we will have the opportunity in this House to debate this fundamental point .
<en> Of course , the structural reforms , as I said earlier , are still the key to the future .
<en> I wish to make a comment on enlargement of the euro zone .
<en> We have noted greater interest in the ' pre-in ' countries in what is happening in our experience in the euro zone .
<en> Or rather , I would say that in the three ' pre-in ' countries , considerable further interest has been aroused , which is reflected in some political attitudes that have been communicated or which we have seen in recent days .
<en> Admittedly , there are still some who criticise the euro and what some people in the Eurosceptic world are afraid of , since the short term problems have not occurred , is what will happen in ten or fifteen years ' time .
<en> Obviously , there is nothing we can say on this point .
<en> It is difficult to control what will happen in ten or fifteen years ' time , but I personally am convinced that by then we will have far fewer problems than we do at the moment in this regard .
<en> What conditions will be imposed on the ' pre-in ' countries in order for them to join the Union ?
<en> Exactly the same as those imposed on the other countries , no more and no less .
<en> Compliance with the Maastricht criteria , with the additional factor of the opt-out clause to which Denmark and the United Kingdom have the right .
<en> There will be no change either for the ' pre-in ' or for the candidate countries .
<en> We take the view that the equal treatment of all Member States of the Union is a fundamental principle , which we should not alter under any circumstances .
<en> A last comment on an issue that might be a minor one but which is , to a certain extent , the issue that has concerned us today : the practical problems involved in the introduction of the euro .
<en> Have businesses played the role of the bankers ?
<en> No , they have not .
<en> Through the system of frontloading , businesses have acted as an incentive for the rapid take-up of the single currency .
<en> It is true that some practical problems have occurred , due more to pressure by some citizens to use businesses as a bank , when they have tried to change high denominations of national currency in businesses and not in the banks , as should have been predicted .
<en> Have there been serious problems of counterfeiting ?
<en> There have been neither serious nor less serious problems in this area .
<en> So far , we have not seen counterfeits that could technically be called ' counterfeit euros ' .
<en> There have been photocopies .
<en> There have been euros produced with scanners , but which are enormously different from the real euro and , consequently , these concerns , which are occasionally expressed , should no longer be an issue .
<en> The euro has an extremely high security factor , unlike some of the world ' s other national high circulation currencies , and this should guarantee that this type of situation is not going to occur .
<en> I would also deny the truth of some of the assertions made about the functioning of ATMs .
<en> There have indeed been practical problems .
<en> Anyone who goes to automated toll booths machines not far from here will see that some machines do not work with the currencies of every Union country .
<en> These are practical problems , whose importance we should not exaggerate : they are merely anecdotes within an enormously important and complex process .
<en> Nor do I feel that there are major pricing problems or that prices in the sales will influence prices in January , as they have not done in the past , since they have never been taken into account .
<en> Last week , speaking with the former chairman of Ecofin , Mr Reynders , we said that the clear lesson we have learned from this process is that the next time we change currency we must not do it on the first of January .
<en> But since I am sure that this situation will not arise , I would say that we have no need to worry about this problem either .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for your immense cooperation during this period .
<en> It has been crucial to helping the good work of the Member States , to ensuring that the public has been better informed and also to providing encouragement for the Commission ' s work .

<en> Madam President , there were a couple of dissenting voices in the Committee on Agriculture about a subsidy for tobacco and I was one of them .
<en> I make no apology for that .
<en> I support the Commission very much on what they are trying to do in phasing out tobacco subsidies and I would encourage them to continue at a faster pace , rather than a slower one .
<en> We cannot justify European taxpayers ' money being spent on tobacco production .
<en> One of the key objectives of the common agricultural policy is to produce good , wholesome food for the consumers of Europe .
<en> I cannot quite see how tobacco fits into this scenario .
<en> I have a great deal of respect for Mr Cunha , the rapporteur , but on this occasion he has got it wrong .
<en> He is a little like King Canute , who wanted to stop the tide coming in but was unsuccessful .
<en> The Committee on Agriculture did not face up to the realities .
<en> Over the past ten years we in Europe have spent GBP 6.5 billion or EUR 10 billion - GBP 2 for every citizen in Europe - to subsidise tobacco .
<en> One third of this tobacco is of very low quality and is seldom smoked at all .
<en> Another third is dumped on Developing World markets which then destroys their markets for tobacco .
<en> Is this a role of the common agricultural policy ?
<en> It is a role we have tried to avoid .
<en> Only one third of this tobacco is smoked in Europe .
<en> We cannot , therefore , justify the support that we are giving .
<en> We all accept the need to support farming in rural communities , but we have to find different crops and different ways of supporting them in the future .
<en> The final point I wish to make is that , of all the areas of this support that I dislike , the continuation in Amendment No 17 of the support for very low-quality tobacco is the most wrong .
<en> If anything should be corrected it is this .
<en> I urge the Commission to phase out the growing of this very low-quality tobacco immediately .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I have one very brief question to ask Commissioner Fischler .
<2en> Today we received the opinion of the Council 's legal services , questioning whether recital 5 of the Commission proposal is legal .
<2en> The Council 's legal services question whether recital 5 is legal .
<2en> My question to Mr Fischler is this ; does he intend to withdraw recital 5 ?
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by thanking you , Mr Cunha for your excellent report , which is obviously based on an in-depth analysis of the Commission proposal .
<2en> This proposal fixes the premiums and guarantee thresholds for the next three years , changes the scope of the Tobacco Fund and slightly simplifies the common organisation of the market .
<2en> As far as premiums are concerned , the Commission proposal is that the current amounts should remain unchanged , with the exception of variety group 5 , which Mr Parish referred to earlier , where we propose a 10 % reduction .
<2en> This being the case , we cannot accept Amendment No 17 ; the reduction in premiums for this variety group has only been proposed because the market situation is now totally untenable , with prices in free fall and very high stock levels which will affect future developments on this market .
<2en> As far as guarantee thresholds are concerned , the Commission proposal is that they should gradually be reduced by 2.6 % to 334 000 tonnes by 2004 .
<2en> This figure more or less corresponds to quantities produced in the 1999 and 2000 financial years .
<2en> Amendments Nos 18 and 19 are not acceptable to the Commission because the suggested guarantee thresholds and the way in which they are broken down bears no relation to current production demands and efforts to encourage varieties for which there is greater demand .
<2en> Recital 5 , which the honourable Member referred to earlier , reflects the political framework underlying the proposal as regards the Tobacco Fund .
<2en> This proposal is a twofold proposal .
<2en> First it amends the scope of the Fund , by dispensing with funding for agronomic research in order to support producers switching to other crops and , secondly , it gradually increases the amount retained to 5 % .
<2en> The Commission has created a new political framework in its communication on a strategy for sustainable development .
<2en> We are working towards phasing out aid for the tobacco sector because we are required under Article 152 of the Treaty to guarantee a high level of human health protection in all Community policies .
<2en> We too are aware of the fact that there is no direct relation between tobacco production and smoking levels , that is , people will not stop smoking because we provide less support for tobacco growing .
<2en> The political question lies in Article 152 , which quite clearly states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in all Community policies , that is , including all aid policies .
<2en> Which means that the other question no longer applies .
<2en> The deletion of this recital suggested in Amendment No 2 is therefore unacceptable .
<2en> Nor is the suggested reference to the European Parliament 's resolution in Amendment No 3 acceptable because it has nothing to do with the proposed regulation .
<2en> Amendments Nos 4 to 6 , calling for an assessment of the social and economic impact have already been overtaken by events .
<2en> We are already carrying out a comprehensive assessment which also deals with these aspects .
<2en> The Commission cannot therefore decide on a timetable for abolishing aid here and now , as called for in Amendments Nos 25 and 26 .
<2en> The Commission is aware of the potential impact of phasing out aid to tobacco growing , especially in various production areas such as Greece , Spain and Italy , where the social and economic structure is particularly fragile .
<2en> The Commission communication therefore makes provision for measures designed to create alternative jobs and profitable economic activity under rural development plans to support producers switching to other crops .
<2en> Amendments Nos 7 and 11 calling for continuing aid for agronomic research are unacceptable because promoting measures to switch into other crops is now a strategic priority and we must move decisively in this direction .
<2en> The Commission takes the view that tobacco producers must be offered new ways of diversifying into other crops or other sectors .
<2en> Funding can be provided for research under the Community research policy .
<2en> Information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco consumption need to be extended and new information campaigns need to contain more comprehensive information on the harmful effects of smoking .
<2en> That is why we propose gradually increasing the amount retained to 5 % by 2004 and why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 or 9 .
<2en> Amendments Nos 22 and 23 calling for an additional 5 % to be retained are unacceptable because they will overstretch a great many enterprises financially .
<2en> Amendments Nos 7 and 16 are unacceptable ; they are superfluous because the assessment due for completion by 2002 also deals with these aspects .
<2en> The same applies to Amendments Nos 10 and 24 .
<2en> Amendments Nos 1 and 8 are unacceptable because the derogation for cooperative undertakings is difficult to justify .
<2en> However , may I remind you that the auction procedure is optional for producer Member States and they are free to decide whether or not they consider it advisable to introduce this procedure .
<2en> Finally , I should like to point out that the individual components of this proposal , by which I mean maintaining premiums at current levels , adjusting thresholds to current production levels , the three-year period of validity and promoting diversification , form a balanced entity which is tailored to producers ' requirements and takes account of new prospects .
<2en> In the first quarter of 2003 , the Commission will present new proposals to the European Parliament and the Council for the future of the sector thereafter , based on the results of the assessment , which should be available by the end of this year .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify what he just said .
<en> Commissioner , you stated that the Commission is proposing certain measures and alternative employment opportunities in the context of rural development .
<en> That at least is what I understood you to have said .
<en> May I therefore enquire , Commissioner , whether you could provide tobacco farmers with assurances on alternative employment ?
<en> Are you in fact guaranteeing jobs ?
<en> I would be grateful for clarification .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , it all depends on what the honourable Member understands by the term guarantee .
<2en> What we are doing in this proposal is as follows , as I have already explained : in order to be able to take account of the Commission communication to the European Council , we must develop alternative forms of employment for people at the same time as phasing out tobacco subsidies .
<2en> We do not just want to apply a wait and see policy here ; we want to test out various alternatives in a sort of pilot stage and see what the best and most promising alternatives are .
<2en> Some of the 5 % funds which I referred to will be used for this .
<2en> If you take a close look at the Commission communication on sustainable development , you will see that what we are starting to do is to phase out tobacco subsidies and develop suitable alternatives in the areas affected at one and the same time .
<2en> That is what I explained and that is exactly what we want to do .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Commissioner .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<sp>
<2en> ( NL ) I should like to ask the Commissioner a question .
<2en> I gather from the committee meetings that it actually would be possible for the European Commission to accept all the adopted amendments .
<2en> I should like to find out from the European Commission tomorrow morning why it does not in fact adopt certain elements .
<sp>
<en> This marks a slight departure from the usual procedure , but since the question is interesting and if the Commissioner would like to give an answer , I shall give him the floor .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I could specifically mention each of the amendments that the Commission cannot accept , but if the honourable Member agrees , I will give her in writing the reasons why we cannot accept the list of amendments I have just read out .
<en> There is at least one amendment for which this is easy to understand : Amendment No 28 .
<en> It rejects the Commission 's proposal in its entirety .
<en> This is one which , I am sure , the Commission will never accept !
<sp>
<en> There is your answer .
<en> Thank you , Commissioner .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in the end I voted in favour of Mr Fatuzzo 's report , despite the fact that some of the amendments that I had tabled with Mr Brok , on behalf of my group , had been rejected .
<2en> It is a pity , because they clarified the aspects of pension policy for which the Member States are responsible and the - very few - aspects for which the European Union is competent .
<2en> The oral amendment tabled by Mr Fatuzzo to our Amendment No 16 talks about the Commission 's support for guaranteeing the right to a pension .
<2en> The word ' support ' may cause confusion .
<2en> It must be clear that there can be no question of the Commission providing funding to enable the objectives laid down in this paragraph to be met , objectives with which all of us agree .
<2en> The Commission cannot provide financial assistance : all it can do is support a process , as it does with open coordination .
<2en> Moreover , we welcome the Commission 's initiative , in the same paragraph , seeking to guarantee safe and sustainable pensions .
<2en> This would have been more than enough .
<2en> I had not realised that our Socialist colleagues - who are after all quite vigilant when it comes to social security - thought that they had caused confusion here between Community competences and the sacrosanct principle of subsidiarity .
<2en> Yesterday the entire Left in this House violently opposed the Barcelona proposal that it would be worthwhile and necessary for many more people over the age of 50 to work .
<2en> In this case , we are in favour of subsidiarity , all the more so when we are talking about something for which the Member States have full - and not shared - responsibility , which is the case for the three pillars of our pension systems .
<sp>
<2en> The Fatuzzo report on the sustainability of pension systems in the European Union offers a fascinating insight into how Brussels manages to take over an issue , as if it went without saying that it was competent to do so , when there is not a single word in the Treaty on pensions , which are legally - there is no doubt about it - the sole responsibility of the Member States .
<2en> It all starts , as usual , with cautious Commission communications , seeking to show that the sustainability of pensions has a more or less direct influence on certain European competences .
<2en> Similarly , in the conclusions of various European Councils ( Lisbon , Stockholm , Gothenburg , Laeken ) ' brief phrases ' are slipped in to legitimise what the Commission is doing .
<2en> Then one day the idea has taken sufficient hold for the Barcelona Council in March 2002 to call - to general amazement - for the average retirement age to be increased by five years .
<2en> This is bordering on Europe interfering , pure and simple , without any democratic debate having been held .
<2en> Admittedly , most of the ideas expressed are more or less along the right lines .
<2en> But this is an essential tactic in this method of competence creep : for the transfer of competence to be invisible or painless , the policy line expressed must , first , be indisputable .
<sp>
<2en> Our pay-as-you-go pension systems are under threat .
<2en> For clearly identified demographic and economic reasons .
<2en> Everyone is aware of this .
<2en> In France , a white paper raised the alarm more than ten years ago .
<2en> But since then nothing , or nearly nothing , has been done apart from a few reports here and there whose conclusions basically reflected the ideological sympathies of those who had commissioned them .
<2en> The only thing that has really changed is the imminence of the predicted financial catastrophe .
<2en> The French presidential candidates , Chirac and Jospin , have not made any real proposals to save our pensions , which will no doubt save them breaking their promises .
<2en> And in Barcelona , without the electorate 's knowledge , they , along with the rest , opposed the idea of the French having the right to retire at 60 .
<2en> What this government lacks - like those which preceded it and most probably those which will succeed it - is determination and political courage .
<2en> But their salvation will not come from Brussels .
<2en> It cannot come from the European Union with its free-trade , ultra-liberal ideology , which dreams of allowing private insurance companies to make profits from billions of euro of social security , but which has still not been able to solve the problems of pension rights ?
<2en> ( Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<2en> - ( NL ) As social security , public services and the level of prosperity improve , and the environment becomes cleaner , people 's life expectancy grows .
<2en> And with it the group that is dependent on a pension .
<2en> While pensions are crucial for older workers , there are young people for whom retirement is a long way off and rich people who do not need a pension scheme .
<2en> If you deem pensions unimportant , then you will consider them to be a liability which leads to higher taxes and premiums .
<2en> Some politicians will seize this as an opportunity to call for freedom of choice , commercialisation and state withdrawal .
<2en> Governments look into options for cutting costs or have saved insufficiently for sustainable pension provision .
<2en> On this basis , an agreement was reached in Barcelona to increase the pensionable age by an average of five years by 2010 .
<2en> At the same time , workers are fighting to have the pensionable age reduced to 60 or 55 .
<2en> As was the case here in Strasbourg on 7 February , when public transport ground to a halt for the entire day .
<2en> As long as pressure of work continues to rise because the working population is required to deliver maximum productivity , we should not be surprised if people burn out at an increasingly younger age .
<2en> This is why I opt for the variant of a guaranteed pension for everyone , so that people can retire at a reasonable age without being condemned to a life of poverty .
<sp>
<2en> The Commission deserves credit for having appropriately addressed an issue which is crucial to social cohesion in a 15-Member State Europe , soon to be a 27-Member State Europe .
<2en> It must also be complimented on having done so adopting a line and principles which , preserving the subsidiarity criterion , facilitate the creation and development of common guidelines and goals through the open method of coordination and the national action plans on pensions .
<2en> However , we believe that , although the Commission communication covers a wide range of aspects , it fails to give adequate consideration to the scale of the issue or , therefore , to its future assessment .
<2en> Mr Fatuzzo , whose work I support , has stressed a large number of specific points , starting with the need to codify in future indicators what is actually pension provision and what , on the other hand , is welfare provision although , by mere political whim , a burden on pensions saving and therefore on the resources of the underwriters .
<2en> Two further points deserve a mention : the first concerns the removal of taxation on pension schemes , the second essentially social cohesion within the individual States .
<2en> With regard to the first point , it would , in fact , be absurd to consider , as happens in some States , the gross amount of pension expenditure when we know that that amount is subject to taxation in any case , irrespective of the different levels applied .
<2en> With regard to the other point , cohesion , there is no doubt that the disadvantaged territories of the Member States can and must benefit from incentives for the development of local economies and therefore of employment .

<en> Madam President , the twin bodies of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman form a key plank in bringing the European Union closer to its people .
<en> Much has been written about the democratic deficit and voter alienation in the European Union .
<en> As a directly elected representative of the people , I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents .
<en> Much has been achieved over the past year through the close cooperation of the Ombudsman and the committee .
<en> I would like to offer Mr Söderman my fullest congratulations on an outstanding tenure of office .
<en> He came to Strasbourg with already considerable experience in defending citizens ' rights in his own country .
<en> Indeed the notion of an ombudsman is originally a Nordic one .
<en> There is no doubt that in areas such as openness , transparency and creating a public service that really serves the people , the European Union has benefited greatly from the Nordic perspective .
<en> Mr Söderman indicated to us some time ago that he would be stepping down early next year .
<en> He has done an outstanding job in establishing the role and function of the Ombudsman as the first person to hold this important post .
<en> Informing citizens about this important office naturally requires time and resources , and it is true that work remains to be done in increasing the profile of the European Ombudsman .
<en> Whoever Mr Söderman 's replacement might be , and we are all aware that the selection process is already under way , he will have a lot to live up to .
<en> Mr Söderman has been most assiduous in executing his brief on behalf of the citizens of Europe .
<en> He has not hesitated to tackle the European Union institutions head on at the highest level if he felt it right to overturn the decision resulting from bad administration .
<en> I wish him well in his retirement and would like to assure him that if he is ever feeling depressed during the long , cold Finnish winters he would be most welcome to visit sunny Ireland .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , great praise has been showered on Mr Söderman and also on the two rapporteurs , Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis .
<2en> It is as a matter of principle that I wish to reiterate this , having read this great tome that comes out every year and found that he has achieved an enormous amount .
<2en> It is lamentable that the Committee on Petitions is prevented from playing the part to which it might do justice by the excessive inadequacy of the resources with which it is equipped .
<2en> The Committee on Petitions must be a real point of contact for citizens , but the Council should also take even more account of it .
<2en> The Nice Treaty states that the European Union must be brought closer to its citizens .
<2en> This might present an opportunity to do this at this level , and it is enormously important that the Ombudsman has offered to develop joint activities with local and regional ombudsmen and with committees on petitions .
<2en> The European Union will always find it difficult to be recognised in the Member States as the servant of the people that it is meant to be .
<2en> In particular , more attention needs to be paid to Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<2en> This is where it is enormously important that the Charter should become legally binding and be incorporated into the Treaties .
<2en> If we do not manage to force this through , we will find the European Union 's credibility hard to defend .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I am going to comment on the Koukiadis report .
<2en> Hardly a year has passed since we debated the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions for 2001 - for which I was rapporteur - and I am pleased to note that the right of petition is increasingly strengthening the political control that the European Parliament can exercise in relation to excessive violations of Community law .
<2en> This also allows us to assess the state of the application of that law within the Union and the degree of satisfaction amongst the citizens with the Community institutions , which are absolutely essential in a Union which is so large , so multi-faceted and sometimes so disconnected from those institutions .
<2en> All of this is taken up superbly in the report by Mr Koukiadis which , furthermore , comes at an historic moment for the Convention , which should not sidestep - this would be a great mistake - the strengthening of the right to petition and the enlargement of a uniform administrative code of conduct .
<2en> For all these reasons , we congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Koukiadis .
<2en> However , we once again regret - and this aspect is also taken up in the report we are debating - the lack of attention the Council is paying to this inalienable right of the European citizens , since the Council is still absent throughout the process , and this at a time when it is trying to gain more power for itself , to the detriment of Parliament and the Commission .
<2en> Furthermore , we are delighted at the intention to introduce preventive measures to prevent abuses of cultural and environmental heritage - which , by the way , are issues which are at the forefront of the European citizens ' concerns .
<2en> I will end by insisting also that we should investigate procedures aimed at effectively remedying the national authorities ' lack of willingness to cooperate with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament .
<2en> We must study them and implement them as soon as possible .
<2en> We have had enough of the lukewarm positions of the Council and the national governments .
<2en> As the rapporteur suggests and as has been proposed in corresponding reports in previous years , we should even go as far as to renounce , in press conferences , the obstructive and reticent attitudes of the governments to the resolutions of Parliament 's Committee on Petitions .
<2en> And I would also like to wish Jacob Söderman all the best for his Iberian retirement .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the report submitted by the Ombudsman demonstrates that this is an important and necessary post .
<en> We must safeguard the financial resources of the Ombudsman 's office .
<en> This is something that is not always taken sufficiently seriously in Parliament 's Committee on Budgets .
<en> I will use the same figure of speech the former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the former Soviet Union used referring to the present Chairman of the Russian Social Democratic People 's Party , Mikhail Gorbachov : the Ombudsman must have iron teeth .
<en> With regard to human resources management in the EU the Members of the Commission act as both prosecutors and judges .
<en> This is shown once again in the case of Martha Andreasen .
<en> It would be appropriate if the impartial Ombudsman were also to look into that person 's punishment .
<en> The present system does not provide legal protection .
<en> It would also certainly be worth the Ombudsman 's while to undertake an own-initiative enquiry and report with regard to the administrative practices of the European Central Bank .
<en> The bank 's openness and the transparency of its administration represent the worst standards in the EU .
<en> It is regrettable that the Ombudsman in his annual report should have to state that the EU institutions have failed both to put the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice and implement the decision on the European Parliament 's good administrative behaviour .
<en> The remarks about administrative discrimination on the grounds of age or gender are particularly regrettable .
<en> In the annual report there are 21 photographs of the Ombudsman , and in most of them he has a gentle expression on his face .
<en> When it is a matter of a departure from good administrative practice the friendly exterior should deceive nobody .
<en> Our Ombudsman acts fearlessly , like Jaakko Ilkka in the Finnish Cudgel War , against the tyranny of the administrative nobility .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I will not use up my two minutes to thank the Ombudsman - because it would be quite possible to do so - but instead I will focus attention on a matter raised in Mr Wynn 's report .
<en> The Ombudsman has appealed to the Convention proposing that he should in some cases be able to refer violations of fundamental rights to the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
<en> This is a notion that should be taken seriously , because the Ombudsman seems to be the sole European institution that is really founded on the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<en> All the other institutions seem instead to be backsliding with regard to its demands , although it is the very institutions themselves these demands should be binding on .
<en> Secondly , I would like to raise a point made in the report drawn up by my colleague , Mr Koukiadis , which is absolutely crucial with regard to what Mr Kronberger said about strengthening the powers of the Committee on Petitions so that it could represent and defend the rights of citizens .
<en> Point 5 of Mr Koukiadis 's report states the notion that the Treaties should provide the possibility for citizens to initiate reform of Community law by petitioning the European Parliament .
<en> I ardently support this view and believe that , as we are discussing opportunities for citizens to have an influence , we should at long last include citizens as participants in the decision-making process and not just as the subjects of that process .
<en> We might take an example from a country like Switzerland , where the people can indeed initiate the legislative process .
<en> I believe we need such initiatives if we want the public to accept that the European Union has jurisdiction over their lives .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> ( FR ) I am glad that the Kreissl-Dörfler report has been adopted by a large majority , including the important section devoted to the need to greatly increase controls on imported animals and animal products from vulnerable countries and their neighbours , which led to the disease that struck Europe in 2001 .
<2en> No control on imported products , however , could ever be as comprehensive , precise and rigorous as those applied by Member States and professional bodies themselves .
<2en> Controls on imports will never provide the same safety guarantees as regular controls and traceability applied to national production and localised production in Europe .
<2en> This should further encourage us to apply Community preference effectively and keep as much of our agricultural production as possible within the European Union .
<2en> Community preference , which is laid down at the heart of our Treaties , must , in future , be our favoured means of satisfying new consumer requirements in Europe in the area of food safety .
<2en> This is yet another reason to defend it vehemently to the WTO and ensure that our right to make imported products bear the cost of the controls we need to carry out on them is respected .
<sp>
<en> That concludes the explanations of vote .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed- at 3 p.m. )
<sp>
<en> The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , item 11 of yesterday 's Minutes refers to a speech I made under Rule 121 ( a ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<2en> Apart from the fact that I would like to ask the Secretariat why there is no written summary of what I said , I would like to remind the House that I asked the Presidency to make firm representations to Belgian Railways on behalf of Parliament , calling upon them to reverse their worrying unilateral decision to withdraw night train No 299 , that legendary train that used to connect the European Parliament 's three places of work - Brussels , Luxembourg and Strasbourg - before , crossing Switzerland and arriving in Milan .
<2en> This train has been withdrawn by a unilateral decision .
<2en> Apart from the serious inconvenience this represents for the employees of the European Parliament , this makes things very difficult for the thousands of others travellers who often do that journey , particularly now with the approach of the end-of-year festivities .
<2en> Since the Presidency of Parliament , responding to a similar speech by Mrs Ghilardotti at the start of the sitting of 5 September , said that they would make representations to Belgian Railways , I would like to know what was done , following both my and my fellow Member 's requests , to obtain the response of Belgian Railways .
<2en> Is there a follow-up to this type of request ?
<2en> I would also like to know what happened to the speech I made yesterday , for I would like a written summary to be included in tomorrow 's publication .
<sp>
<en> Mr Santini , I would point out that your comments do not count as comments on the Minutes , because comments on the Minutes deal with what has been said during the sitting .
<en> You are repeating a request , and there is another procedure in our Rules of Procedure for obtaining this information .
<en> However , I myself can tell you - although I am stretching the Rules of Procedure - that Mrs Ghilardotti 's request was duly communicated to the Office of the President , who will communicate it to the competent Belgian authorities .
<en> ( The Minutes were approved )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> ( IT ) I am certainly aware of this , within the confines I stated at the start ; that is , it is not within the competences of the European Union to adopt normative actions directly affecting this area .
<2en> Clearly , I will - as I told you , Mr Liese - following thorough examination , put forward a strong , political action for consideration by the Council .
<sp>
<2en> I would thank you very much for your answer .
<2en> Through the Italian Prime Minister , the Italian Presidency has today emphasised the importance of close cooperation with the United States , constituting a North Atlantic alliance on a variety of global issues .
<2en> In what way can the European Union use the good relationship between the Italian Prime Minister , that is to say the new President of the European Union , and the US President to promote joint action by the United States and the European Union to bring about a ban on cloning within the UN system ?
<sp>
<en> The Council has taken note but is not going to reply to this question .
<en> Question No 10 by Linda McAvan ( H-0381 / 03 ) :
<en> Subject : Human rights workers in Indonesia
<en> The recent abductions and murder of human rights workers in Aceh are a cause of great concern .
<en> According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , five of the six international NGOs and four UN agencies operating in Aceh have been advised by the Indonesian Government to cease their activities for their own safety .
<en> It is the responsibility of the Indonesian Government to ensure the safety of its citizens and human rights workers on its territory .
<en> What action is the Council prepared to take in light of this rapidly deteriorating situation ?
<sp>
<2en> ( IT ) The Council is following the human rights situation in Indonesia , particularly in Aceh , very closely .
<2en> Since the breakdown in peace talks and the subsequent declaration of martial law in this province in May 2003 , the Indonesian security forces have launched a significant joint operation against the Free Aceh Movement .
<2en> Military police operations are being carried out in this province on a vast scale which could effectively endanger the safety of personnel of international NGOs and UN agencies .
<2en> The European Union has urged the Indonesian Government on various occasions , both in public and in private , to protect civilians during the ongoing battles , to safeguard the human rights of the population of that province and to seek a peaceful , negotiated solution .
<2en> The Union would remind you of the recent Resolution on Human Rights Defenders , adopted by consensus at the 59th Commission on Human Rights in Geneva .
<2en> This resolution calls on all the States to adopt the necessary measures to protect human rights defenders and in this regard , I can assure you that the European Union will urge the Indonesian Government to allow Hina Hilani , Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations on Human Rights Defenders , to visit that province .
<2en> Moreover , the Union will continue to closely follow developments there and to express its serious concerns , in an appropriate way , to the Indonesian Government .
<sp>
<en> Is the Council aware that only in the last few days there has been a further crackdown on the activities of human rights organisations in Aceh .
<en> For example , they are now forbidden to talk to the press and to make statements .
<en> If the Council is aware of this , what will it be doing about it ?
<en> Will the Council make contact with the Indonesian authorities ?
<en> Effectively it is becoming more and more difficult to find out what is happening and whether human rights are being abused as we sit here today in this Chamber .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , you cited a Rule that I did not know existed when you made your ruling on the points of order by Mr Wieland and Mr Van Orden .
<en> Rule 138 ( 3 ) mentions that points of order concerning the validity of a vote may be raised after the President has declared it closed .
<en> Thus Mr Wieland had the right to do what he did .
<en> Rule 138 ( 4 ) provides that ' after the result of a vote by show of hands has been announced , a Member may request that this result be checked using the electronic voting system ' .
<en> You did not do that Mr President .
<en> I know the final decision on all this is yours , but it was a legitimate call by a host of Members of this House .
<en> You said at the very beginning of this voting session that your eyes were playing you up .
<en> I would humbly ask that you take a check on Amendment No 16 .
<en> ( Applause from the right )
<sp>
<en> I am going to apply Rule 138 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure , which gives that final responsibility to the President , and I therefore consider the result I declared previously to be valid .
<sp>
<2en> ( NL ) Mr President , as rapporteur , I would not like to see any ambiguity left about one section in the decision-making process .
<2en> I should therefore like to urge you to consider complying with the EPP 's request and permitting , at this stage , an oral vote on point 16 .
<2en> I appreciate that you would then have to go back on a decision , but I should nevertheless like to urge you to treat this report in such a way as to leave no misunderstanding or uncertainty on this matter at all .
<2en> I would therefore make an urgent appeal to you now to honour the request .
<sp>
<en> I am sorry but I am not changing my opinion .
<en> We shall proceed to the vote on the whole of the motion for a resolution thus modified .
<en> ( Parliament approved the resolution )
<en> Report ( A5-0281 / 2003 ) by Mr Fodé Sylla , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights and Freedoms , Justice and Home Affairs , on the situation concerning fundamental rights in the European Union ( 2002 ) ( 2002 / 2013 ( INI ) )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to present an oral amendment to the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 135 , which says the following : ' calls on the institutions to provide access to opinions of the Legal Services , respecting the principles established by the Court of Justice ' .
<2en> I believe that this amendment would resolve the small problem which had arisen .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , in his speech Mr Cashman made various quite serious allegations .
<en> I concede that he has been consistent throughout in seeking to block this report by every means and at every turn .
<en> I would simply ask you to confirm that the action of the House in receiving this report is fully in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and that it is acceptable .
<en> As regards paragraph 5 concerning the accompanying explanatory statement , I am more than ready to make an oral amendment to my report that the explanatory statement , in accord with our usual practice , should not be included with the report .
<en> It is the report that is important , but I would welcome your confirmation on that point .
<sp>
<en> Mr Perry , I can confirm that Parliament 's services have carried out careful checks as to whether this report is acceptable , and have come to the conclusion that it is indeed acceptable .
<en> Mr Cashman has the floor .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I agree that the report as it stands is now admissible , but that is because changes were made that I and Parliament 's services asked for and which the services upheld .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 11.59 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
<sp>
<en> The next item is the vote .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> – Very well , you will have all the explanations you require .
<2en> For the moment I shall suspend the sitting for a few minutes pending the formal sitting .
<2en> ( 1 )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we now come to the vote on Amendment 24 , the famous Nisticò compromise .
<2en> There are some translation problems here .
<2en> I would like to point out that the English version is the correct one .
<sp>
<2en> – We have taken note of your comment , even though I am not sure that the language of the sitting is English .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , unfortunately I have to report that my efforts to reach a compromise that might also have met with agreement in the Council have failed .
<2en> I must therefore unfortunately distance myself from the outcome of the vote and ask my fellow Members to vote against the report .
<sp>
<2en> – Very good , we will take note of your declaration , Mr Liese .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> . – A sound argument in favour of maintaining European agricultural subsidies is that they enable small farmers to survive falls in their products ’ prices and to contribute to preserving a viable countryside .
<2en> This argument is cancelled out if tax money is misused to line the pockets of rich farmers and agricultural multinationals .
<2en> A recent study by the development organisation Oxfam shows that EU agricultural subsidies in Great Britain mainly benefit large landowners .
<2en> For example , it is estimated that the richest of them , the Duke of Westminster , receives some GBP 38 per hour in agricultural subsidies .
<2en> Even the rapporteur , Mr Garot , who , as a Social Democrat , unfortunately considers the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon , now observes that something is amiss where agricultural subsidies are concerned .
<2en> Between 1995 and 2002 , agricultural incomes rose by 7 % , but at the same time , the number of farms fell by 15.7 % .
<2en> The remaining farms increased in size and became more intensive .
<2en> Agricultural support is being distributed unevenly : 20 % of the farms receive 73 % of the direct support for 59 % of the acreage and only 25 % of the jobs .
<2en> The rapporteur is , above all , anxious about farms that produce little but do receive support .
<2en> I would be more in favour of a ceiling , a maximum limit of support for each farm .
<2en> Without such a measure , the agricultural funds would become a source of useless bureaucracy and an unjust form of redistribution .
<sp>
<2en> . – I abstained during the vote on Mr Garot 's report , despite the fact that it backs development and reform in the direction of agricultural policy with decoupled premiums and strengthened rural policy .
<2en> The report does not , however , take sufficient account of the restrictions that govern the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy .
<2en> Even the financial leeway available impacts on the policy to be adopted .
<2en> I should particularly like to draw your attention to paragraph 25 , in which cofinancing for agricultural and rural policy is rejected .
<2en> In my view , compulsory cofinancing is precisely one of the key instruments that can help adopt a common agricultural policy in the future .
<sp>
<2en> This report focuses on the current crisis in agricultural incomes in a number of Member States .
<2en> The crucial issue here is the extent to which the common agricultural policy is fulfilling the aims established by the Treaty in terms of ensuring a decent standard of living for farmers and inhabitants of rural areas .
<2en> While overall agricultural income increased by 7 % between 1995 and 2002 , this result was obtained at the cost of an 18 % reduction in the number of farms .
<2en> We have seen the social costs of this phenomenon for Portuguese farmers , who have been forced to abandon or to modify the activities that they have always carried out .
<2en> The truth of the matter is that in comparison with other sectors of the economy , agriculture has been lagging behind .
<2en> The overall figures also hide major disparities , such as the fact that 20 % of farms receive 73 % of CAP aid .
<2en> These farms only account for 59 % of the land and 25 % of jobs in the sector .
<2en> The situation is politically and socially unacceptable and explains the behaviour of some Member States wishing to maintain their privileges under the CAP .
<2en> By voting in favour , we endorse the wording in the report of the recommendations with regard to the recently strengthened pillar of rural development of the CAP , promoted ...
<sp>
<2en> Within the framework of the CAP , the number of farms fell sharply – by 15.7 % – between 1995 and 2002 , which led to a rise in agricultural incomes across the whole of the EU .
<2en> This rise was in fact due both to this reduction in the number of farms and to the increase in farm size .
<2en> Pluriactivity and diversification have also helped to maintain agricultural incomes .
<2en> Examination of the reality of rural life in Member States , however , reveals , in many cases , that farmers are dependent either on public aid or on the fluctuations of prices and markets , leading to a feeling of insecurity , and , in turn , to low levels of investment in modernisation and in crop diversification .
<2en> Farms are becoming increasingly concentrated , and , unless this trend is combated , it will result in the depopulation of the countryside , thereby endangering all of the external factors supported by the countryside , not all of which are quantifiable .
<2en> The aims of ‘ competitiveness ’ and ‘ multifunctionality ’ must be made compatible , thereby ensuring a minimum level of security for those involved in farming , as well as confidence in a fair standard of living and in the stability of income .
<2en> The outcome of this would be viable Community agriculture that is capable of supporting the highest possible number of farms and jobs throughout the EU .
<2en> I voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> . – I voted in favour of the Garot report in recognition of the merits of an initiative which for once has enabled us to debate one of the fundamental questions affecting the preservation of our agricultural model : our farmers ’ incomes .
<2en> This debate has enabled us to break with the fragmentary and technical approaches normally forced on us when examining the flood of legislative proposals emanating from the Commission .
<2en> I also wanted to mark my full agreement with the review of the fundamental aims of the CAP , the relevance of which the report reaffirms : ‘ to promote a territorial approach to agriculture capable of preserving as many farms and jobs as possible throughout the EU ’ and ‘ to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and stabilise incomes with a view to maintaining farming activity throughout the European Union ’ .
<2en> I can only express my amazement , however , at the contradictory reasoning which , on the one hand , always approves the Commission ’ s proposals , be they for decoupling or for lowering external protection , while on the other denouncing the risks of total adulteration of the European agricultural model that those same proposals entail .
<2en> My approval therefore clearly does not apply to the references to decoupling and to rural development contained in the Garot report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , excuse me for laughing but we are not alone anymore , Mr Monti !
<2en> I can see two other Members arriving !
<2en> I thought we could have been alone , but another time maybe !
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , unfortunately I have to say that it was I who asked to have this point debated , and for one simple reason .
<2en> I find it difficult to understand why a temporary – and , I repeat , a temporary – subsidy arrangement must now suddenly be extended .
<2en> As rapporteur for Parliament ’ s statement on the original regulation , it is fairly clear to me that I asked the Commission for a guarantee that this arrangement would only be temporary .
<2en> The Commission assured me of this , as did you too , Mr Monti .
<2en> For the same reason , the regulation was also limited in time .
<2en> The regulation contained , moreover , a mousetrap clause whereby the regulation would cease immediately in the event of the dispute with South Korea being resolved .
<2en> When an expiry date was placed on the regulation , it was precisely because there was no wish to see this arrangement become permanent , regardless of whether or not the dispute with South Korea was resolved .
<2en> For me , this was a mitigating circumstance , since at no time have I been convinced that South Korea does in actual fact compete on unequal terms .
<2en> On the contrary , I am afraid that this regulation has only helped to distort competition internally within the EU .
<2en> I would therefore take the liberty of asking you , Mr Monti , whether the regulation is , in reality , on its way to becoming permanent , and whether you do not see this as a backward step in the fight against direct production subsidies .
<2en> Could it perhaps be said that a promise has been broken in this case ?
<2en> I am therefore rather tired of the matter this evening .
<sp>
<2en> You are no longer my favourite Commissioner , Mr Monti , but you can change that if you give me the right answer tonight !
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we are talking about temporary events and I know that being the favourite Commissioner of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen is at most a temporary situation – it may imply an in and out evolution in this lucky status .
<2en> I believe I continue to deserve that status , not only because of the inherent generosity of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , but also because I believe – and I say this in front of witnesses ! – we are sticking exactly to the promise made to you and to others in Parliament .
<2en> Why was this mechanism adopted as temporary ?
<2en> First because the Commission – and I in particular – was totally against the re-introduction of an unlimited , permanent mechanism on operating state aid for shipbuilding .
<2en> It therefore had to be temporary .
<2en> Temporary means two things ; it is not permanent and it must have a logical criterion to define how temporary it is .
<2en> The logical criterion there was the reasonable expectation about the duration of the procedure before the WTO .
<2en> We might be accused of logical incoherence if , after having proposed this – it was also decided by Council and Parliament – we were now to depart from that logical criterion .
<2en> To be more direct , I confirm that this is not by any means meant to be the re-introduction of a permanent mechanism .
<2en> It continues to be strictly related in time to the conclusion of the WTO procedure .
<2en> I should like to further clarify – and I am sure Riis-Jørgensen will appreciated this – that in spite of other views , no extension of the scope of application to other market segments has been introduced .
<sp>
<2en> The debate is closed .
<2en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. ( 1 )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I have nothing against developing vocational training by harmonising it at European level .
<2en> However , that vocational training must include a large portion of general knowledge , language learning and so on , which means that the big employers must not be involved in the running , management or even the inspiration of that training .
<2en> Otherwise , we will simply be manufacturing labour to meet the changing needs of the bosses and not to serve the interests of young people .
<sp>
<2en> I am pleased to support this report , which recognises that Cedefop 's achievements to date demonstrate its ability to make a valuable contribution to the development of the Community 's vocational training policy .
<2en> The Agency , created in 1975 , provides excellent services for the European Commission , the European Union Member States and the social partners , as well as for the associated countries of Norway and Iceland .
<2en> Cedefop provides policy makers , researchers and practitioners with information to promote a clearer understanding of developments in vocational training and thus enable them to take informed decisions for future action .
<2en> I believe the proposed amendments will improve the efficiency of Cedefop 's administrative procedures , and am particularly glad to see that they will lead to a balanced representation of men and women by addressing this issue in the whole chain of the nomination and election procedure .
<sp>
<2en> As successive external evaluations have shown , the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training ( Cedefop ) , an EU Agency that was created in 1975 , has , over the course of the years , made a vital contribution towards developing the Community ’ s vocational training policy .
<2en> The tripartite composition of its Board is reflected in the participation of government representatives , employers ’ organisations and employees ’ organisations , with the Commission as the fourth participant on the Board , which gives its opinions greater legitimacy and enables it to make better-informed and more effective decisions on the ground .
<2en> The proposed amendments to the basic Regulation of Cedefop are intended to increase its ability to respond , in view of the impending enlargement , and to provide an institutional framework that is more efficient , more flexible and more effective .
<2en> I wholeheartedly welcome the fact that all of the social partners will be involved in consultations on a social project that will lead to an increase in professional qualification and jobs , and will , in turn , lead to improved quality of work .
<2en> For this to happen , I feel that greater emphasis must be placed on informing the citizens of Europe about the work of this and other agencies , in order to raise awareness of the enrichment , both individual and collective , that can be derived from ongoing vocational qualifications .
<sp>
<2en> The Moderate Party delegation has opted to abstain from voting on the above matter .
<2en> The fight against terrorism and the protection of privacy are not opposed to each other .
<2en> A far-reaching , effective fight against terrorism requires respect for fundamental rights .
<2en> The United States ’ requirements have put airlines in an impossible situation , as the requirements infringe EU privacy protection , or obstruct air transport .
<2en> The Commission has tried in an exemplary way to find a solution .
<2en> We do not , therefore , support the resolution ’ s call for the Commission to withdraw the draft .
<2en> The draft improves the present situation , but still has serious shortcomings .
<2en> The data-protection commissioners in the Member States and the EU , the Article 29 Committee , point out the worrying lack of data protection .
<2en> The draft necessitates a thorough legal revision , and consequently we support an examination by the Court of Justice of the European Communities .
<2en> A prompt changeover from the ‘ pull ’ to the ‘ push ’ system is necessary in order to remedy the lack of data protection .
<2en> Preconditions for a satisfactory agreement are that passengers be guaranteed information on which data is transferred to the US authorities , and that passengers have the option in practice of giving voluntary consent to such a transfer of personal and economic data , and to inspect the data recorded .
<sp>
<2en> Conservative MEPs fully support the fight against terrorism and all the means which can be deployed to meet this end .
<2en> We are aware of the fact that considerable negotiations have been underway between the European Commission and the US authorities regarding passenger information .
<2en> We are satisfied that the agreement which has been reached provides the right balance between privacy and the means of protecting our lives and liberties .
<2en> Whilst we understand that passengers may find this inconvenient from time to time , recent events have shown that we must all remain alert and vigilant .
<2en> We are all in this fight together .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> We are giving this explanation of vote in connection with the following items .
<2en> Item 13 : We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguard services when it comes to joint operations , planning and the development of competence .
<2en> We do not therefore believe that there is a need to develop a new , parallel organisation in the form of a European coastguard service .
<2en> Item 17 : We are doubtful about European funding of places of refuge .
<2en> We believe that those countries that have accepted their responsibility and funded places of refuge along their coasts should not be forced by other states ’ negligence to create places of refuge .
<sp>
<2en> . – The report by the temporary committee is yet another attempt to conceal the anti-labour policy in shipping and defuse reactions by the grass-roots and labour movement to crimes at sea in which dozens of seafarers lose their lives every year and which have grievous consequences on the environment .
<2en> The allegation in the report , that 80 % of accidents are due to human error , is erroneous , unscientific and suspicious , in that it endeavours to cover up the responsibility of the shipping companies and government authorities by concealing the deterioration in naval training and glossing over the consequences of an obsolete fleet , defective surveys , inadequate crew compositions and intensification of the work of seafarers .
<2en> The accidents are directly linked to the unaccountability which prevails , especially in the second registers of the Members States of the EU and on ships sailing under flags of convenience .
<2en> It has been proven that the shipping registers operate as mechanisms to cover up infringements of legislation and perpetuate the unaccountability of shipowners , by issuing certificates which , on most occasions , do not reflect the actual state of the vessel .
<2en> The proposals by the Commission and by Parliament conceal the responsibilities and promote the behaviour of the big shipping and shore monopolies and , on the pretext of combating terrorism , promote measures which strike at fundamental democratic rights of seafarers .
<2en> We demand the immediate release of the master of the tanker and his return to Greece .
<sp>
<2en> . – To widespread indifference , eighteen people died in January 2004 in the wreck of the freighter off the coast of Norway .
<2en> Maritime transport is still subject to the laws of the ‘ crooks of the seas ’ and the European Union does nothing !
<2en> Three years since the adoption of the ‘ Erika ’ legislative packages , seven Member States ( Italy , Greece , Finland , Belgium , Luxembourg , Austria and the Netherlands ) have still not incorporated Community decisions into their national legislation .
<2en> There is a pressing need to put an end to the system of convenience in maritime transport .
<2en> We must do away with flags of convenience , starting with those in the EU .
<2en> We must guarantee a high level of training and remuneration for seafarers .
<2en> We must provide ourselves with the means of enforcing the legislation , strengthening the ranks of the inspectors or establishing a European coastguard force .
<2en> Finally , we must turn the spotlight on the responsibilities involved in the sinking of the , especially those of the Aznar Government .
<2en> With the accession of Cyprus and Malta , the EU will become the number one maritime power in the world .
<2en> It will have the ability to change the IMO rules in a sector affected by capitalist globalisation .
<2en> Without this commitment , we shall continue to be powerless to stop the human , social and environmental destruction .
<2en> The Sterckx report is broadly inadequate in this respect .
<sp>
<2en> I congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report on maritime safety , which I fully support .
<2en> I share the concerns about maritime safety expressed by the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea and by the rapporteur himself , reminding all parties involved that maritime safety is an issue that still requires substantial and lasting political attention .
<2en> This will determine the quality and safety of vessels navigating European waters and European vessels throughout the world as well as protection of the coasts and of the European public .
<2en> I firmly support the measures that have been adopted in this field , particularly those banning single-hulled tankers transporting heavy oils from European waters and those conferring further powers on the European Maritime Safety Agency .
<2en> I shall conclude by reaffirming something to which I have referred on several occasions during my term of office : safety is everyone ’ s responsibility and requires everyone ’ s commitment !
<sp>
<2en> The Spanish Government , which was responsible for the disaster involving the tanker and the fuel oil on the coasts of Spain , France and Portugal , has now been voted out by the electorate .
<2en> In order to ward off possible oil pollution in one Spanish port , the captain of this ship was instructed to leave the coast and eventually to sink in open sea , as a result of which the disaster became much greater .
<2en> Of the 77 000 tonnes of crude oil on board , 43 000 tonnes have been salvaged , and it is estimated that 14 000 tonnes are still on board .
<2en> This means that 20 000 tonnes disappeared into the sea and that the coast of Galicia remains polluted long term .
<2en> The report is right to criticise the Netherlands and Belgium for not , apparently , regarding the application of port state control and vessel inspection by classification bureaus as an urgent matter .
<2en> Proposals have been made for the designation of ports of refuge , compulsory insurance cover to be able to recoup damage and costs from shipowners , the use of transmitters to trace lost containers and the stricter observation of existing environmental and safety rules ; these receive my support .
<2en> It is unfortunate that the European coastguard service , which it is apparently planned to set up , is not only intended for the joint protection of the environment , safety and compliance with fishery restrictions , but is also directly linked to the hunt for immigrants and possible terrorists and the further construction of a European superstate .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Jensen ( A6-0020 / 2004 ) – draft general budget 2005 ( other sections ) – along with amendments that strike me as more useful , because I feel that , in fact , the Community institutions are provided with the funding that they require for developing their activities , particularly given the requirements of the enlargement process , the major impact of which will be felt in the financial year 2006 .
<2en> I should like to add one note of caution .
<2en> I believe that it is the institutions ’ duty to manage public money – taxpayers ’ money – carefully and sensibly .
<sp>
<2en> The 2005 budget will be the first to cover the 25 Member States for a full year and the last before the next Financial Perspectives are presented .
<2en> It is therefore important to promote the fast and effective integration of the new Member States in all fields .
<2en> I regret the fact that some funding has been cut and that there is little ambition in this financial year , particularly at a time of plummeting public confidence in the ability of Community and national institutions to deliver wealth and well-being , at a time of dwindling expectations of economic upturn and at a time of increasing outcry over the mirage of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy .
<2en> As I have written on many occasions , the Europe of which the founding countries dreamed – and the Europe to which our citizens aspire – is a Europe of peace and prosperity , the key feature of which is that we share both values and interests ; an internal market that genuinely fosters prosperity ; an ambitious Europe geared towards people ’ s well-being , and not some all-powerful , distant or self-sufficient super-structure .
<2en> I expect much more from the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013 .
<sp>
<2en> We do not believe that the EU should grant economic resources to Bosnia and Herzegovina to ease the transition to market economies .
<2en> Our view is that the EU should have limited competence and that this is not an issue for the EU .
<2en> We are not opposed to economic aid to other countries , but believe that this type of decision should be made at national level or within the framework of the UN .
<2en> We particularly question why the EU should support a reform of the financial sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report on additional macrofinancial aid to Bosnia Herzegovina , because I believe that in order to press ahead with its moves towards economic stabilisation and reform , Bosnia Herzegovina still needs further financial aid from the Community and from other bilateral and multilateral donors .
<2en> Bosnia Herzegovina is committed to moving forward along the road to economic stabilisation reforms .
<2en> I feel that the EU must press ahead with its objective to assist in supporting the balance of payments , to help to reduce the country ’ s external financial constraints , to offset the effects of reforms already carried out and to lay the foundations for joint institutions and policies , pursuant to the Dayton peace agreement .
<sp>
<2en> The terrible civil war on Bosnian territory has left marks that are still in evidence today .
<2en> Nevertheless , the country is enjoying a degree of social peace and institutional normality , something that the EU should be encouraging and supporting .
<2en> Given that the implementation of political reforms in Bosnia Herzegovina took longer than was provided for by Council Decision 2002 / 883 / EC , I believe that the process must be applied to this case as a matter of urgency .
<2en> This Decision must , indeed , be amended so that , extending its period of validity , the third instalment of additional macrofinancial aid can be paid to the country , thereby strengthening the economic sustainability and institutional reforms underway .
<2en> I voted in favour .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , honourable Members , I am pleased that it appears that the draft regulation on pesticide residues in food and feed can be adopted at second reading .
<2en> The negotiations between Council presidency , the European Parliament rapporteurs and the Commission have recently gained momentum and last week the final obstacles were cleared .
<2en> Allow me to underline the significance of these regulations for food safety .
<2en> It will enable us to set harmonised maximum residue levels in the EU for all pesticides and all agricultural products in one piece of legislation directly applicable to all EU citizens .
<2en> All situations will be covered , including a list of pesticides for which no maximum residue levels are required and the low level that will apply systematically to all pesticides for which we have no information .
<2en> There will be clarity about how and to whom an MRL application should be made , and on the procedure to be followed .
<2en> The European Food Safety Authority will carry out the risk assessment for consumers with the best available methodology .
<2en> Control and enforcement by the Member States will be reinforced and improved .
<2en> Coordination of monitoring by the Commission will have a more obligatory nature .
<2en> This legislation will benefit all parties .
<2en> Consumers will profit from better protection and more transparency about which pesticides could be present in food and their potential effects .
<2en> Food producers will benefit because there will be more clarity as to what specifications the products have to comply with .
<2en> Control and enforcement bodies will be able to refer to one single Community list of maximum residue levels .
<2en> Member State legislators will no longer need to transpose the provisions into national legislation .
<2en> Before I finish , I would like to make a few comments on the finer points resolved in the negotiations .
<2en> The European Parliament 's insistence on taking cumulative and synergistic effects into account may lead to a breakthrough in the development and application of the necessary methodology .
<2en> I am pleased that this is now explicitly mentioned in the draft legislation .
<2en> I welcome Parliament 's determination to make an explicit link between the setting of maximum residue levels and good agricultural practice , integrated pest management and the use of the lowest amounts of pesticides necessary .
<2en> The clear requirement to take into account vulnerable groups of the population , including children and unborn children , is also a useful step forward .
<2en> These issues make a positive contribution to this regulation .
<2en> The final phase of the negotiations saw an increasing mutual trust among the parties .
<2en> I am happy to confirm that the Commission can agree to and accept the compromise package worked out between the three institutions .
<2en> I trust that you will confirm Parliament 's acceptance at the vote tomorrow .
<2en> We are now approaching the conclusion of this project .
<2en> It is time to acknowledge the efforts of all parties and in particular to thank the rapporteur , Mr Sturdy , for his handling of this dossier and for the time and effort he has put into his report .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what we are aiming at includes less bureaucracy and greater simplicity ; this single Regulation is meant to replace four basic directives on pesticide residues .
<2en> This is not just about food safety and health , but also about equal opportunities in competing in the internal market and – let us not forget – on the global market .
<2en> Producers and processors must operate under identical conditions , and all consumers are entitled to safe food .
<2en> The European Food Safety Authority has great responsibility where risk management is concerned .
<2en> It is no use whatever to consumers to get , week in and week out , one new warning after another , sometimes petering out into such generalisations as the statement that , for example , apples from a particular Member State are exceeding the maximum permitted levels , when such announcements are helpful only if they include the name of the company whose products contain excessive residues of pesticides .
<2en> We are setting very high standards right across the EU , particularly where health is concerned , and quite rightly too .
<2en> Equally , though , we have to look more closely at imports into the European Union .
<2en> There is no room for double standards here , and what that means – as I see it – is tighter controls on imported goods .
<2en> We cannot intervene in their production processes in the way we can with the food produced here , and that makes it all the more important that the end market be checked and monitored .
<2en> I am glad that the committee was able to come up with a compromise on the definition of ‘ good agricultural practice ’ .
<2en> Europe ’ s farmers produce in accordance with the most stringent legal requirements , as is best known in the case of the rules on cross-compliance .
<2en> Those who farm in accordance with the law must also be certain that their products pose no health hazard .
<2en> I am grateful to Mr Sturdy for the work he has done over many months , and for the good compromise that we have been able to reach .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Sturdy .
<2en> I think that our cooperation has been constructive and has proceeded in a pleasant and open atmosphere .
<2en> I should like to thank the other ‘ shadow rapporteurs ’ , and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound guidance and advice we have received .
<2en> I am pleased that I have been allowed to deliver my first speech here in plenary on a matter as important as this .
<2en> In actual fact , I see this draft Act or legislation as an example of the EU at its best .
<2en> We shall secure a number of things with this draft Act if it is adopted in the form in which we should like to have it adopted .
<2en> Firstly , cross-border trade is of course ensured .
<2en> A variety of foods is guaranteed , as is their presence on the shelves at lower prices .
<2en> Other , still more important , things are , however , also ensured , namely consumers ’ health , safety and security in connection with the foods they buy .
<2en> I come from a very cold country up in the north , so I am pleased to be able to buy fruit and vegetables in the winter too .
<2en> I am only pleased , however , if I can be sure that the apple I eat is also healthy , and this is something that this legislation can help ensure .
<2en> I shall mention a couple of the areas it has been especially important for us Social Democrats to see successfully dealt with and in which I think we have achieved compromises with which everyone can be satisfied .
<2en> Firstly , I want to mention the consideration given to especially vulnerable groups .
<2en> It is one thing to devise legislation with a view to robust , healthy and vigorous men such as Mr Sturdy and myself .
<2en> That is fine , of course .
<2en> There also needs , however , to be legislation with a view to more vulnerable groups such as children , born and as yet unborn .
<2en> That too is something , I am pleased to say , that we have obtained .
<2en> Another thing I would emphasise – and I would now apologise to the interpreters for they are about to be confronted by difficult expressions again – is that we have incorporated cumulative effects that are the result of synergy .
<2en> That is extremely important .
<2en> It sounds a little technical , but in reality it is quite simple .
<2en> The fact is , it is not enough only to take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous a pesticide is .
<2en> We must also take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous two or three or four pesticides are when they interact , that is to say when they react to each other in a particular food .
<2en> That is something it is incredibly important to take account of .
<2en> It is an area about which we do not know much at present , but one about which we need to know more in the future and of which we must take more account .
<2en> Otherwise , there may be major consequences in terms of health .
<2en> I fear that that is already now the case .
<2en> My third point is that it is all well and good to have controls and legislation , but we also need to ensure that there are sanctions .
<2en> I think that naming and shaming is a sensible idea .
<2en> I think it is sensible of us now to oblige the Member States to publish their control results on the Internet .
<2en> It also brings about openness , which in turn produces security .
<2en> The consumer must have peace of mind , and that is something we are in this way guaranteeing .
<2en> Fourthly and finally , I think it encouraging that we have obtained some clear and constructive definitions , including definitions of good agricultural practice and an actual definition of maximum limit values .
<2en> These were not easy things to negotiate successfully but , especially through sound guidance from the Council and the Commission , we obtained a compromise with which everyone can be pleased and which will help secure our objectives .
<2en> I would say that , all in all , this is a proposal that may make a positive difference to the everyday life of Europeans , and that is something I am pleased about and proud to be associated with .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the draft law we are debating in this House today will be of great significance for public health in Europe and for Europeans ’ confidence in food safety .
<2en> It is incredibly important for all our voters in our various constituencies , but it is particularly important perhaps for parents with allergic children .
<2en> Our amendments are in line with what I and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe think is reasonable for bringing about a proposal that is effective from the points of view both of competition and of consumer protection .
<2en> I should like to emphasise a few things .
<2en> The internal market is incredibly important .
<2en> In this internal market , we wish to protect our citizens and , at the same time , set standards for testing and treating food at those links in the chain where the food concerned first comes into contact with the consumer and first enters the distribution chain .
<2en> In this respect , this proposal is sound .
<2en> It is also sound inasmuch as it protects important and vulnerable high-risk groups such as women , infants and unborn children .
<2en> We are also adopting a position on a standard for good agricultural practice .
<2en> In this , we have taken account both of integrated pest control and of climate variations in order to bring about a fairer proposal .
<2en> It is incredibly important that these options for taking account of local or regional variations should not reduce the proposal ’ s level of ambition .
<2en> This is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal , once it has properly entered into force .
<2en> It is good that there have been improvements to the Food Safety Authority in terms of both time and resources .
<2en> I also think that the rapporteur has done a very good job .
<2en> I am pleased that we have been able to make it easier for civil society and the non-governmental organisations to participate in the discussion and handling of these issues .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , it is very late now and very few of us are left but nevertheless we are dealing with a very important issue .
<2en> It is a pity that once again in this Parliament legislation is left until the end of the day .
<2en> In a recent opinion poll 77 per cent of British people said that they are concerned about pesticides in food so , as everyone has said , what we are doing here resonates with public opinion .
<2en> I am very pleased that we have a compromise and that we agree on the main things .
<2en> There are two issues which particularly concern me and I am very pleased that we have secured a deal on them .
<2en> The first is cumulative and synergistic effects : cocktail effects .
<2en> We were told that there is no methodology at present to measure this effect but this is an effect which research suggests is at the root of our problems .
<2en> I am very pleased to hear the Commissioner say that he is going to take this research forward and support Parliament in making sure that we get more research into the cumulative effects .
<2en> That is why I tabled the amendment to recital 5 .
<2en> One problem is that a lot of experts say that these cumulative effects are unfounded , but we have nothing to prove or disprove this .
<2en> We must get this research , it is very important .
<2en> The second issue mentioned by Mr Jørgensen is about the effects on children and the unborn .
<2en> A lot of research suggests that children and the unborn have in some way been affected by either pesticides or chemicals in our environment .
<2en> In a recent radio programme about chemicals they did a series of tests on a grandmother , a mother , and a granddaughter .
<2en> These tests showed that the highest level of chemicals was found not in the grandmother – who had lived through the highest levels of pollution in our streets in the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s – but in the granddaughter who was 15 years old .
<2en> They found in her blood chemicals that had been taken off our shelves many years beforehand .
<2en> We know that some of these substances come in through pesticides .
<2en> It is extremely important that we start looking not just at testing on adults but at testing on children and looking at the effects on babies in the womb .
<2en> Public confidence in food safety and food standards is very low .
<2en> In the survey that I referred to earlier , over 50 % of British people said they did not believe that government reassurances about pesticides were accurate .
<2en> Consequently we need to get it right .
<2en> Scientific research shows that imported products have more pesticides than products grown within the EU .
<2en> This is extremely important legislation .
<2en> I am very grateful to Mr Sturdy , Mr Jørgensen and all those within the Commission and the Council who worked very hard to achieve a compromise that we can all support tomorrow .
<sp>
<2en> Thank you very much .
<2en> That concludes the list of speakers .
<2en> I understand the Commissioner does not wish to take the floor , so the debate is closed .
<2en> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> If there are no objections , Mr Garriga Polledo ’ s technical amendments are accepted .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , there is nothing secret about the statement I now make on the basis of Rule 157 ; on the contrary , I make it openly .
<2en> Our group has had a discussion about the amount to be approved under item 3 .
<2en> This has to do with a great gathering in the Rhineland , from which I come , where the Catholic Church , among other bodies , is organising a great gathering of young people .
<2en> I myself am familiar with this meeting , having once been able , in another capacity , to take part in it .
<2en> It is a good thing .
<2en> This meeting is to include a state visit by the Pope .
<2en> His Holiness will be attending this meeting , and what we would like to be certain of is that the gathering ’ s organisers are asked to provide the EU institutions with documentary confirmation that none of this money will be used to fund the Pope ’ s state visit .
<2en> The Vatican itself will have to pay for that .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , this is a point of order under the same Rule under which you allowed Mr Schulz to speak .
<2en> I should like to note that this is a clear violation of the Rules of Procedure , as well as of the principles of good taste .
<2en> Mr Schulz appears not to understand that the spirit and ethical and moral principles exist alongside the law .
<2en> I should like to remind Mr Schulz of this fact .
<sp>
<2en> The budget is approved .
<2en> Does the Council wish to comment , or is it satisfied with Parliament ’ s approval ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , you have proceeded to your second reading on the 2005 budget – the first full budgetary year of the European Union of 25 Member States and of the implementation of the new Staff Regulations .
<2en> I am pleased to note that the agreement reached between our two institutions during the conciliation meeting on 25 November 2004 has now been included in the 2005 budget .
<2en> It is very important that for the first year of the new term of this Parliament the two arms of the budgetary authority were able to reach global agreement last November .
<2en> It is a positive signal for the future , both for interinstitutional cooperation and for a good budget for the European Union .
<2en> That is why I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Lewandowski , and the two rapporteurs , Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Jensen .
<2en> I would also like to thank the Commissioner , Mrs Grybauskaitė , whose role I have appreciated very much .
<2en> The Council can accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> . – The tsunami disaster is a major international tragedy requiring global solidarity and generosity .
<2en> We have chosen to vote in favour of the proposal .
<2en> In our opinion , however , the UN is the international body best suited to providing humanitarian aid in connection with international disasters .
<2en> The UN has broader international support and greater experience in handling crisis situations than the EU .
<2en> We disapprove of the EU taking every opportunity to promote and strengthen its own position and influence .
<2en> In addition , there is good cause to question whether sending vessels from EU Member States to the countries hit by the tsunami is the most appropriate way of helping .
<2en> An alternative contribution would be to buy the vessels locally .
<2en> This would simplify the relief effort and contribute to the development of the local economies of the countries hit by the tsunami .
<sp>
<2en> The tsunami disaster had an enormous impact on the fisheries sector in India , Indonesia , Myanmar , the Maldives , Somalia , Sri Lanka and Thailand .
<2en> Figures show that thousands of fishermen died , 110 000 vessels were destroyed , with the costs in the sector rising to around EUR 400 million , more than EUR 450 million if one includes repairing damaged port facilities .
<2en> The scale of the disaster means that a major effort is required on the part of the international community to support the rebuilding of this key sector
<2en> Unfortunately , the proposal to transfer vessels to these countries that were destined for the scrapheap in the various Member States illustrates the hypocrisy of nominal and barely practicable aid that does not address the needs on the ground .
<2en> We have arrived at the unheard-of situation of there having been no request from the countries affected .
<2en> According to the figures , with the money spent on sending out these vessels , 9 600 new ones suited to the fishing methods used in those countries could be built .
<2en> We therefore support the amendments aimed at turning this Commission proposal into humanitarian aid and financial and technical aid to develop the fisheries sector in the countries affected .
<2en> We must ensure compliance with the concept of transferring boats if requested and with the criteria laid down by the Food and Agriculture Organisation .
<2en> We voted in favour , in order to rectify a mistake .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the proposal as amended , substantially improved , by the European Parliament .
<2en> In particular , my own amendments , which were supported by a large majority make it clear that this should be only part of a wide range of necessary measures to aid the fishing communities around the Indian Ocean .
<2en> The challenge laid down by the European Parliament is to the European Commission to change its mind and accept our amended proposal , and to the Council of Ministers to follow the strong lead which we have given in this matter .
<sp>
<2en> Despite my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of this unimaginable tragedy , I voted against the Council regulation , for the reasons I shall now explain .
<2en> No estimates have been made of the costs this measure will incur , although preliminary analyses indicate that they could be enormous .
<2en> The fishing boats sent out will be old ones that would otherwise have been scrapped .
<2en> In other words , they no longer meet basic safety requirements .
<2en> This is essentially the same as what happened in Poland during the 1997 floods , when flood victims were sometimes sent completely worn out clothes that were not fit to wear .
<2en> The European fishing boats in question were built to operate in conditions that are entirely different from those prevailing in the countries affected by the tsunami .
<2en> It has become very clear from what we have heard that countries such as Sri Lanka and the Philippines have absolutely no desire to be helped in this way .
<2en> For these and other reasons , I am inclined to believe that the sending of around 150 fishing boats is intended to appease European consciences and to be a symbolic gesture .
<2en> Genuine assistance is what is needed , however , not symbols .
<2en> Seen in this light , it must unfortunately be concluded that the Council regulation does not make sense .
<sp>
<2en> . – The European Parliament voted today on a proposal whereby small fishing vessels no longer used in the EU would be transferred to fishing communities hit by the tsunami .
<2en> I fully agree about how important it is for the fishing industries of the countries hit to recover .
<2en> On the other hand , I do not believe that transferring fishing boats , as put forward in the proposal for a regulation , is the right way to proceed .
<2en> Transferring a number of fishing boats will not meet existing needs .
<2en> In addition , support for the fishing industries of the countries hit should be adapted to local needs and local demand .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Very well , Mr Posselt , you may rest assured that we shall do that .
<2en> I believe we should vote on an amendment to the agenda to the effect that tomorrow , from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m. , the Commission should make a statement on the two items proposed , that is to say , on services in the internal market and on the Directive on the patentability of computer software , for which there are currently more requests in favour .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I beg leave to make a comment on the procedure .
<2en> I would ask you first to have a vote on the services directive , for which there may or may not be a majority .
<2en> We can then – still in a split vote – move on to the software business .
<2en> If you have them both voted on together , you may well end up with a result that this House does not want in the least , and so I ask that we vote item by item .
<sp>
<2en> This is a complicated issue .
<2en> We shall proceed as follows , and this is a decision by the Presidency that I will carry out next .
<2en> We shall vote on the request for the Commission to make a statement tomorrow on services in the internal market and then , regardless of the result of that vote , we shall vote on the proposal that the Commission make a statement tomorrow on the patentability of computer software .
<2en> If both are approved , they will take place jointly from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m.
<2en> We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal that the Commission make a statement on services in the internal market :
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , I am really sorry but I do not understand what we are voting on at the moment .
<2en> Are we voting on replacing the debate on the services directive with the debate on the software patents directive ?
<sp>
<2en> Mrs Frassoni , we have voted on a proposal that tomorrow there should be a Commission communication .
<2en> Now we are going to vote on another proposal that there should be a Commission communication tomorrow on the patentability of computer software .
<2en> We shall proceed to the vote .
<2en> Tomorrow , therefore , from 6.00 p.m. to 6.45 p.m. , there will be a Commission statement on the two issues we have dealt with .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the Commission takes note of the position taken by Parliament and will not hesitate to draw all the necessary conclusions from a possible rejection by your Assembly , taking account of the Council ’ s position as well .
<2en> The Commission will have to reflect on the best way to move forward in this area .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to request a fresh vote , since most of those voting clearly supported the proposal .
<2en> You , however , concluded that the report was rejected .
<2en> I hereby request an individual vote .
<sp>
<2en> No , Mr Baco , there has been a very clear majority of votes against .
<2en> We have therefore taken the correct decision .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to express one regret : since we were dealing with a report assessing the actions of the Council , it would have been very worthwhile and important for the Council to have been present last night .
<2en> It is true that it was an inconvenient time , but it could have attended the debate .
<2en> I believe that this is something that should be provided for in the future , in order to ensure that the Council is here to listen to Parliament ’ s views in relation to this kind of report .
<sp>
<2en> . – Ladies and gentlemen , late yesterday evening there were also wide-ranging debates on the issues of weapons and the arms problem and , in view of the fact that it was necessary to dispel a few concerns in connection with my report , I have carried on working at this time , with the result that two oral amendments are necessary .
<2en> So , after paragraph 33 there is a new section and , in order to dispel concerns and to ensure the full support of the socialists , I fully confirm that the title of the section has been changed , and is [ in English ] ‘ Strengthening effective multilateralism ’ .
<2en> The second oral amendment relates to paragraph 34 and is as follows – the following words shall be included after :
<2en> ‘ ... takes note , as stated by Dr Hans Blix , that the credible threat of the use of force has played an important role in facilitating the disarmament work of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC . ’
<2en> Thus the whole of the last sentence is deleted .
<2en> That , then , is my oral amendment .
<2en> Thank you for your attention ; I ask you to support it .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I judge this to have been a valuable debate and I am grateful to all honourable Members for the varied contributions we have heard this afternoon .
<2en> As I made clear in my introductory remarks to this debate , the security and liberty of all our people are important issues , perhaps the most important issues that our governments presently face .
<2en> I also said that it was right for democracies and their institutions to debate the questions that arise when defending both principles in our modern world , vital that we recognise the unprecedented threat from contemporary terrorism and the longevity of that threat , and crucial that we all respect the rule of law in the process .
<2en> I said it was important to recognise the need for governments to take tangible steps to fulfil their principal responsibility – the security of their people , right to respect the word of other sovereign governments including our allies , and incumbent on European governments and institutions to lead by example and conduct informed debate .
<2en> Overall I think we have achieved those objectives in the conversation and discussions we have had on the threat this afternoon .
<2en> The images of the terrorist attacks – on commuter and underground trains in Madrid and London , places of worship , diplomatic premises , banks in Istanbul , hotels in Jordan , residential compounds in Saudi Arabia , and restaurants and bars in Bali – the list goes on – are not computer-generated .
<2en> They are a reality with which we live .
<2en> They are the new and frightening reality of our modern world .
<2en> The contemporary terrorist is not content to limit himself or herself to conventional attacks .
<2en> If he can , he will acquire and use chemical and biological means to reach his ends .
<2en> On respect for the rule of law , I mentioned the question of torture – a central issue that featured in our debate – in my opening remarks .
<2en> Let me reiterate the position of the United Kingdom Government .
<2en> The prohibition against torture is absolute .
<2en> The British Government , like all European governments , unreservedly condemns its use .
<2en> We never use it for any purpose , including to obtain information .
<2en> We never instigate , condone or otherwise support others using it .
<2en> Indeed , we condemn it .
<2en> We have worked hard with our international partners to eradicate an abhorrent practice .
<2en> On government action to counter the threat within the rule of law , I am pleased that under the UK Presidency the European Union has agreed a new counter-terrorism strategy and thereby provided a clearer framework in which Member States can take forward their national and European work , striking a balance between citizens ’ rights to life and to liberty .
<2en> These are not just words .
<2en> The recent extradition of a man from Italy to the United Kingdom to face charges connected with the terrorist attacks in London in July would not have taken place so quickly but for European arrest warrants .
<2en> That is a practical example of European Union counter-terrorism and judicial cooperation .
<2en> On respect for sovereign governments , I remind honourable Members of the words of the United States Secretary of State on 5 December 2005 .
<2en> She stated , and again I quote directly for completeness : ‘ The United States has respected – and will continue to respect – the sovereignty of other countries .
<2en> The United States does not transport , and has not transported , detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture .
<2en> The United States does not use the airspace or the airports of any country for the purpose of transporting a detainee to a country where he or she will be tortured .
<2en> The United States has not transported anyone , and will not transport anyone , to a country when we believe he will be tortured .
<2en> Where appropriate , the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured ’ .
<2en> Of course , a number of honourable Members have raised the issue of the response of European Union Member State governments to the allegations that have received wide publicity in recent months .
<2en> Let me just for a moment digress from my responsibilities as the President-in-Office of the European Union and share with this Chamber the approach of the United Kingdom Government to dealing with these very serious allegations .
<2en> We have researched the question of US rendition via the United Kingdom carefully and we have not identified any occasions since 11 September 2001 or earlier during the period in office of the Bush administration when we received a request from the United States for a rendition through United Kingdom territory or airspace , nor are we otherwise aware of such a case .
<2en> On providing a lead to our constituents with informed discussion , it is right that the Council of Europe be allowed to conduct a factually based examination of how its members ensure the effective implementation of the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights , which has featured prominently in this afternoon ’ s debate .
<2en> This debate today has raised numerous points – many held with great conviction – for the Council of Europe to address in its coming inquiry .
<2en> For its part , I can assure this Chamber that the United Kingdom will respond fully to the Council ’ s queries .
<2en> I trust and hope that other Member States will do so as well .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this afternoon ’ s debate has revealed a widely held position in this Parliament , and it is one that I too fully endorse : there can be no compromises with terrorists , but there can be no compromises , either , on the protection of people ’ s fundamental rights .
<2en> On the one hand , we have to clarify matters and discover the whole truth – a truth that we may or may not like , but the truth all the same .
<2en> We have to find out the truth and , as Mr Schulz rightly said , avoid making hasty judgments .
<2en> I should like in particular to reply to Mr Geremek , whose speech caught my attention .
<2en> I said in my introduction , regarding your country , Poland , exactly what you are calling for , which is that I have respectfully noted the solemn denial by the Polish Government authorities and that I do not believe that individual European countries can be regarded as being on trial or under suspicion , but that the truth needs to be sought in respect of the whole territory of Europe : all the countries of Europe and all the candidate countries .
<2en> I specifically ruled out any possibility of claiming that this search for the truth only concerns Poland and / or Romania .
<2en> The truth needs to be ascertained everywhere .
<2en> Part of the debate on Europe ’ s essential values concerns both the citizens ’ right to security – and on this point I believe the European Parliament has already said on several occasions that international cooperation with the United States is indispensable if we want to win the fight against terrorism – and the duty of the European Union and of all democratic countries to respect the dignity of every individual .
<2en> Today you have voted by a large majority for an important measure , a useful measure in the fight against terrorism , and one that achieves a balance between security and freedom .
<2en> It sets a good example which , I believe , should be a benchmark for us all .
<2en> It is an exemplary balance between the fight against terrorism and the protection of people ’ s fundamental rights .
<2en> As Europeans we have worked alongside the United States against terrorism and we shall continue to do so .
<2en> For instance , ladies and gentlemen , I regret to say that the extradition treaty specifically aimed at suspected terrorists , which was signed in 2003 , has been ratified by the United States but not by the European Union Member States .
<2en> You realise how important it would be to have a clear extradition treaty in force today , containing strict rules including , of course , a ban on inhumane treatment .
<2en> This goes to show that unfortunately we Europeans also have to do things a little faster .
<2en> Finally , I believe it is possible to interpret the action and efforts to seek the truth not as an action directed against the United States but , as someone said , as an action to seek the truth that will strengthen us all .
<2en> We shall all be stronger , whatever the outcome , because the truth can , I repeat , either make us discover something or make us discover that this something did not happen .
<2en> In any case , the truth would strengthen us because , in the US Constitution , the Treaty on European Union , the Nice Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights , in all of these documents – and I mentioned the US Constitution in first place – the principle of human rights is fundamental and absolute .
<2en> I wonder , therefore , why we should not also work together in this area , to ensure that those solemn principles are put into practice .
<2en> That will be my personal commitment .
<sp>
<2en> I have received six motions for resolutions ( 1 ) tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<2en> The debate is closed .
<2en> The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00 .
<sp>
<2en> The next item is the joint debate on
<2en> - the report by Geoffrey Van Orden ( A6-0342 / 2005 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the state of preparedness for EU membership of Bulgaria ( 2005 / 2204 ( INI ) ) , and
<2en> - the report by Pierre Moscovici ( A6-0344 / 2005 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the extent of Romania 's readiness for accession to the European Union ( 2005 / 2205 ( INI ) ) .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , it is only six weeks since this House last debated Bulgaria ’ s progress towards European Union accession .
<2en> I have been back to Bulgaria since then , as indeed has the President of Parliament .
<2en> We met the President and the Prime Minister of Bulgaria and many ministers .
<2en> I visited a children ’ s home in an area that had been badly affected by floods and a factory that had benefited from EU funding .
<2en> I had discussions with the Foreign Minister , the Interior Minister , the President of the Supreme Court and police chiefs , including those running the national organisation for combating organised crime .
<2en> I also met the chairmen of key committees of the parliament and representatives of all political parties .
<2en> None of them seemed to be under any illusion about the work that needs to be done , or indeed the urgency of addressing the areas that have been highlighted by the Commission and the Parliament as being still of serious concern .
<2en> Many however , are increasingly alarmed that Bulgaria ’ s accession is being caught up in the wider controversy over the future extent of the EU and over the EU budget .
<2en> Mr President , bearing in mind that I am otherwise speaking for my current political group in this debate , I hope you will excuse me if I make two personal comments on these matters .
<2en> Firstly , many of us are disappointed that following the defeat of the Constitution , the opportunity has not been seized to have a wide ranging and open discussion about the nature and direction of the EU in order to take full account of the real wishes of our citizens and make it more relevant to the needs of the 21st century .
<2en> Secondly , as Mr Barroso observed this morning , there is a structural problem in the budget .
<2en> I am not sure that he and I would agree on what that problem is .
<2en> To my mind , it is the fact that some 40 % of the EU budget is spent on the common agricultural policy and it is also the fact that the United Kingdom , year on year for twenty years , has been paying double the amount in net terms into the EU budget , even with her abatement , in comparison with a country such as France that has a similar-sized economy .
<2en> Let me revert now to my rapporteur ’ s role .
<2en> The point is that accession countries such as Bulgaria should certainly not be disadvantaged because of those wider issues .
<2en> The timing of accession should not be vulnerable to unrelated concerns about future enlargement .
<2en> Let us remember that neither Bulgaria nor Romania form part of future enlargement rounds ; they are part of the previous enlargement .
<2en> Their accession is already secured .
<2en> Indeed , their budgetary arrangements for the first two years after accession are also secure .
<2en> I am sure the Commissioner will confirm this .
<2en> Bulgaria ’ s financial provisions are fixed from 2007 to 2009 in the Accession Treaty , Title III , which was signed on 25 April this year .
<2en> These determine the amounts Bulgaria will pay into the EU budget in various forms , as well as what she will receive in cohesion funding , nuclear decommissioning assistance , the transition facility , the Schengen facility , agriculture payments and other structural actions .
<2en> So , leaving aside any negative attitudes to enlargement in general that have begun to develop in some countries , what are the substantive obstacles to be overcome by Bulgaria in the next few months ?
<2en> Firstly , the Accession Treaty must be ratified by all Member States .
<2en> So far , only seven have done so , Parliament urges the remaining 18 Member States to ratify as soon as possible .
<2en> Secondly , there is the question of the precise timing of accession .
<2en> Parliament supports the common objective of Bulgaria ’ s accession to the EU on 1 January 2007 , provided that certain matters of serious concern are dealt with .
<2en> Without this firm target , a major incentive to increased effort by the Bulgarian authorities is removed .
<2en> They are making an increased effort .
<2en> I can report that in the past month a further six major legislative acts have progressed through the Bulgarian National Assembly and I am advised that key constitutional changes that we have called for will be presented to the National Assembly this year .
<2en> However , while legislative change is essential , I cannot re-emphasise too strongly the need for tangible and concrete outcomes .
<2en> We must see the evidence of change , particularly in the vital areas of justice and policing and the fight against organised crime and corruption .
<2en> It is this area , more than any other , that has been the focus of my report on behalf of Parliament .
<2en> There are , of course , other areas of concern , including child welfare and the support for and integration of the Roma communities .
<2en> I commend my report to Parliament .
<2en> It had the widest possible support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and I regret that the GUE / NGL Group has chosen to re-table amendments that were rejected by the committee .
<2en> With the exception of my own Amendment 16 , I do not recommend support for any other amendments .
<2en> I urge the Bulgarian authorities to take very seriously the need to deliver on reform .
<2en> The changes are , of course , beneficial in themselves , not just as a prerequisite for EU membership .
<2en> I ask the Commission to ensure that Parliament remains fully involved on a timely basis in any consideration of the use of safeguard clauses .
<2en> 1 January 2007 is an achievable date for Bulgaria ’ s accession to the European Union .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , although the recent results of the Palestinian elections hardly inspire optimism , I believe that one of the greatest mistakes the European Union , in general , and this Parliament , in particular , could make , would be to rush to hasty conclusions .
<2en> What I do believe we can say without any mistake is that the presence of the European Union ’ s electoral observation mission has been a notable success for the European Commission and that — as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said — it increases the Union ’ s visibility and contributes to the consolidation of democracy throughout the world .
<2en> We must therefore congratulate the Commission and also our fellow Members Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser , as well as the other Members of this Parliament who accompanied them .
<2en> Madam President , I believe that it would be premature to draw the conclusion that the spluttering peace process in the Middle East will be buried as a result of these elections or that these elections herald the death of the Oslo agreements .
<2en> I believe that we must allow a little time to pass and see what moves are made .
<2en> In particular , despite the mistakes made , we must treat the President of the Palestinian National Authority as a legitimate interlocutor , wait until the new government is formed , remembering — as Mrs De Keyser said — that 75 % of the citizens who have voted for this political formation do not want the destruction of Israel and , finally , Madam President , assess what impact this electoral process will have on the Israeli elections .
<2en> Sooner or later , Commissioner , however , regardless of the urgent short-term issues , the European Union will have to give its opinion on something that is fundamental : whether the immense needs — as you have said — of the Palestinian people are compatible with the existence of Hamas , whose founding convention calls for the liquidation and destruction of the State of Israel , and the fact that it appears on the European Union 's list of terrorist organisations .
<2en> In this regard , Madam President , the European Union 's action must not show double standards : it must renounce terror and violence as a means of political action or renounce European Union action and aid .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I wish to thank Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs De Keyser : the elections went smoothly in every way .
<2en> Over and above that , these are historic elections : this is the first democratic change in the Arab world .
<2en> The Palestinian people did not vote in favour of Hamas , it voted against Fatah .
<2en> Hamas won on the basis of a programme centred on the fight against corruption and on the reform of the PLO , the only organisation authorised to negotiate .
<2en> Above all , it won on the basis of a social programme to be implemented specifically within Palestine .
<2en> Those were my specific impressions when , away from our mission , I met the Palestinian mayors and their association , which is dominated by Hamas .
<2en> As for aid , we must continue helping the Palestinian people , make sure that officials are paid and , above all , prevent the State from collapsing , otherwise the Palestinian Authority will fall into the hands of another country .
<2en> It is imperative that we wait , ladies and gentlemen , but let us not become naively optimistic .
<2en> Read the Hamas Charter : it is despicable and disgraceful .
<2en> It must be rendered null and void so that the new government can become a discussion partner .
<2en> We have to set a date – a schedule – so that Hamas faces up to its responsibilities , because it has become a legitimate party in a democratic country .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I will be quick as I only have one minute in which to express my disappointment at seeing that , in this Chamber , our Parliament has chosen carefully to avoid ‘ speaking the truth ’ .
<2en> There are six references , seven recitals and twelve articles in this text on the Palestinian election result , and not once do they manage to mention – even mention – Hamas and the Charter of hate underpinning its ideology and its action .
<2en> Mr Schapira just said how despicable – I think that that was the term used - the Charter is , and Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke of a repugnant charter .
<2en> Clearly , I share these opinions .
<2en> I would say that we deserve a Nobel ‘ Cliché ’ Prize at a time when , despite the Charter , we have actually heard the Middle East Quartet , Europe ’ s ministers , the media and Mr Solana , only a few moments ago , asking themselves the crucial question : how can we cooperate with Hamas and continue providing our vital assistance to the Palestinians if Hamas does not renounce terror and does not recognise Israel ?
<2en> Mahmoud Abbas , for his part , does not pull any punches when it comes to setting out his demands faced with the Islamists .
<2en> Yes , the ballot was democratic – at least in terms of the way in which it was carried out .
<2en> Yes , Hamas won .
<2en> Yes , we want to continue helping the Palestinian Authority .
<2en> Yes , in the end it is up to Hamas today to take the crucial decisions and to change .
<2en> This is what needed to be said no less clearly and directly to the pragmatists on both sides : a democratic ballot has just brought to power an undemocratic ideology .
<2en> That is the persistently difficult equation that we need to resolve today .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , the election in Palestine was conducted in an exemplary fashion .
<2en> I should like to congratulate the Palestinians and say a big thank you to my colleagues .
<2en> There are still problems in Israel and Palestine , however .
<2en> Palestine is occupied .
<2en> The fact is highlighted in a list of UN resolutions , which criticise Israel ’ s ongoing breaches of international law , as well as the settlements , the dreadful Wall and the attempt to annex East Jerusalem – just to mention the worst problems .
<2en> The difficult situation in Palestine is mentioned in the common motion for a resolution , which contains a number of constructive points .
<2en> The proposal sets out the relevant conditions for Hamas .
<2en> We must keep a careful watch to ensure that Hamas does not again have recourse to terrorism , it now having kept the peace for more than a year .
<2en> Certainly , we must not take away the right they have under the Geneva Convention to armed resistance to the occupation , but we must make determined and carefully considered efforts to ensure that the situation does not get out of control .
<2en> All non-governmental groups should be disarmed both in Palestine and among the Israeli settlers .
<2en> We must discourage any form of radicalisation in both Palestine and Israel .
<2en> The motion for a resolution that is before us might well be read as a unilateral recognition and , if we are to help bring about peace , that would of course be dangerous .
<2en> I would therefore call on Members to vote in favour of the amendments by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , especially the amendment to paragraph 10 , which contains a very clear formulation of the Council ’ s decision not to publish the report on East Jerusalem , prepared by the Heads of Delegation in Palestine .
<2en> Once this report ’ s criticism of the situation in East Jerusalem , together with the attendant recommendations , have been clearly withdrawn , the motion for a resolution will be a tool well suited to making further progress towards a just peace between Israel and Palestine .
<2en> I would call on us to be consistent now .
<2en> We do not have sufficient credibility among the Palestinians , and it is time we did so .
<sp>
<2en> – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I must say how grateful I am to the Commission , as well as to Mrs De Keyser , Mr McMillan-Scott and our whole delegation , for their sensitivity and intelligence .
<2en> I believe , however , that the failure to publish the report on East Jerusalem – which in actual fact is the focus of the debate – and the failure to adopt appropriate measures effectively gave Hamas a helping hand , because there is no doubt that certain truths should not be left unspoken .
<2en> I think it was on the cards that Hamas would win .
<2en> Much of the responsibility for that lies with the international community , which , after the Oslo agreements were signed , was incapable of ensuring that international law would prevail and be respected .
<2en> Thus it neither implemented the ‘ two peoples , two states ’ principle , nor guaranteed Mahmoud Abbas sufficient support , since funding alone is not enough – what the Palestinians want is political support .
<2en> Nor did it , at the same time , exert the necessary pressure on Israel to prevent the growth of the settlements and the annexation of land .
<2en> In particular , although the international community had the strength needed to exert pressure , I feel that it did not succeed in ensuring that negotiations would effectively be resumed .
<2en> Nonetheless , the Palestinians managed to respond with a democratic electoral process in which the people did take part , expressing their need for life , justice and peace .
<2en> For me as a woman , the Hamas victory is a terrible outcome ; I see it almost certainly , however , as a protest vote against al-Fatah , which held sway over Palestinian society for many years but was unable to keep its promises , and also against corruption , although that is a somewhat demagogical issue .
<2en> In my view , it really is the European Commission ’ s and the international community ’ s task to rekindle the dialogue and to keep it alive , thus ensuring that both Hamas and Israel can put a stop to violence and acknowledge the ‘ two peoples , two states ’ principle in practice .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , many issues have been raised in the course of this debate on the European Union ’ s common foreign and security policy .
<2en> As I see it , three types of security are required if all Europeans are to feel genuinely safe .
<2en> I shall begin with energy security .
<2en> The whole Union is much troubled by the subject , as are individual Member States such as Poland .
<2en> There seems to be no desire to take common action in this field .
<2en> Germany enhanced the security of its own energy supply by signing an agreement with Russia for the construction of the northern gas pipeline .
<2en> Unfortunately , Germany ’ s action did much to undermine the security of Poland ’ s energy supply .
<2en> The Union has so far failed to respond to this situation , although it is abundantly obvious that Russia is using the supply of raw materials for energy as an important tool with which to influence other countries ’ policies .
<2en> Russia ’ s decision to shut off gas supplies to Ukraine and Georgia has shown just how effective this tool can be .
<2en> I shall now move on to food security .
<2en> The security of our food supply is based on the common agricultural policy but unfortunately this policy is coming increasingly under attack .
<2en> Finally , I would like to mention physical security , which is now under much greater threat due to terrorism .
<2en> There can be no meaningful common foreign and security policy without significant progress in the three areas I have highlighted .
<2en> I trust Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner will bear my remarks in mind .
<sp>
<2en> It is clear that the political situation around the world , from country to country and region to region , does not accord with our values , aspirations and expectations , nor is it becoming calmer or more democratic .
<2en> At the same time , however , we are getting explicit requests for more Europe from various parts of the world .
<2en> In Mongolia they say the European Union is our third neighbour .
<2en> And when I visit the Balkan states , Latin America , Transcaucasia or Central Asia , I hear the same thing – more Europe .
<2en> Yet while numerous partners want more Europe , we often find ourselves involved in our own unproductive concerns , and we are forgetting the fundamental ideas of Schuman and the other fathers of Europe in our desire to build more Europe with less money .
<2en> It does not surprise me that our partners and our citizens do not understand the jargon about the various pillars of our policy , but they can sense precisely when we are united and when we are divided and ineffective .
<2en> The experience with energy supply has taught us that national policies alone will not bring either greater internal security or greater external influence .
<2en> I have the impression that even now the course of events demands more common policy than the already ratified Constitutional Treaty would bring about .
<2en> If we truly wish to play a key role in the Balkans , in the east of Europe or elsewhere , we must find ways of expressing our common foreign and security policy more robustly .
<2en> Something that would certainly contribute to this is a greater regard for the role of the European Parliament , which has shown itself to be a dynamic and responsible player .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I can virtually carry on where Mr Peterle left off , for if , as you , Mr Solana , have said , many in Europe are bidding us to take action , then the time for action really has come .
<2en> Let me give just two examples of what I mean .
<2en> I am not rejoicing in the sufferings of others when I say that the great American initiative for the wider Middle East has , in fact , collapsed , and that the intervention in Iraq has done nothing to improve matters .
<2en> The inadequate and hesitant support for the peace policy and the peace initiative in the Middle East helped Hamas to victory in the elections ; I mention only in passing the fact that Fatah itself must bear much of the blame for this .
<2en> As for Iran , we all know that more involvement on the part of the USA in security policy would play an important part in persuading Iran to refrain from developing its own nuclear weapons .
<2en> Now , then , is the time , for the European Union – working with the USA rather than in opposition to it , which would be absurd – to clearly define what a comprehensive foreign policy in the Middle East might be like , including everything from a determined peace policy to support for civil society in the individual countries .
<2en> The second example is that of energy policy .
<2en> As has already been said , we , being a major consumer , need to present a more united front on the world market ; we need to mobilise and form coalitions with other consumers .
<2en> We have seen precisely what happens – in Iran , for example – when we do not make common cause with them .
<2en> If Russia starts to make its energy policy an instrument of nationalist policy , then we must make our own – or at least part of it – more European .
<2en> Commissioner , we await the report with eager anticipation .
<2en> This is an issue that I asked you about as long ago as your appointment hearing .
<2en> It is of the utmost importance that we should now have this report in our hands and be able to say out loud that , while we need our national energy policies , they must be supplemented and extended by a strong European energy policy which is also an essential instrument of foreign policy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the EU ’ s role as an international player is an important one , and it has strengthened in recent years .
<2en> The EU achieves results the gentle way , by which I mean through negotiations , discussions , persuasion and crisis management .
<2en> This is sometimes a slow process , but it creates a firm basis for lasting solutions and for a viable society .
<2en> In its foreign policy , the EU stresses the importance of democracy , and we want to take that forward .
<2en> In this connection , I would like the EU to emphasise more strongly that without literacy there can be no democracy , nor can there be democracy without respect for women ’ s rights .
<2en> We should therefore do more to ensure that children , young people and women in different parts of the world know how to read .
<2en> This will create a lasting basis for democracy , peace and respect for human rights .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in the French and Dutch referendums ( or referenda ) has meant that the whole document is now no longer relevant .
<2en> It is proving very hard for some people to come to terms with the disappearance of a concept that has been promoted for so many years .
<2en> The common foreign and security policy was an important part of the aforementioned Treaty , but I would like to remind you it was rejected unequivocally .
<2en> We are therefore amazed to note that efforts are being made to refer to a document that is entirely meaningless and as good as dead .
<2en> Mr Brock ’ s report is an example of this approach .
<2en> It makes a laughing stock of the House and tramples the democratic principles advocated by the European Community underfoot .
<2en> The requisite period of reflection following the demise of this Treaty should not be devoted to getting specific chapters of the Constitution adopted through the back door .
<2en> The time should be used instead to reassess common action at an international level and to place greater emphasis on the importance of issues such as energy security and the threats posed by epidemics and terrorism .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Very good , now we have the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , on which the Presidency will allow a vote , that the vote on this resolution take place at the next part-session in Brussels .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would just like to point out that there is – thank heavens – to be no mini-plenary in Brussels ; instead the next proper plenary session is here in Strasbourg .
<sp>
<2en> Very good , thank you for your observation .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , this conflict is being discussed not only throughout Europe , not just in all the newspapers , not just by the man and woman in the street day in and day out ; it is a conflict with profound implications and is being talked about around the world .
<2en> It surely cannot be the case that one institution alone does not discuss it , does not adopt a resolution on it , that the European Parliament , which the people elected to represent them , should choose to keep silent about one of the greatest conflicts Europe has seen .
<2en> It just cannot be true !
<sp>
<2en> We shall proceed to the vote on the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that the vote on the resolution should take place during the next part-session .
<2en> We still have to vote on the third proposal from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that an item on the agenda be postponed , namely the Outlook for Bosnia-Herzegovina .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , I would like to warmly thank Commissioner Verheugen for the speech he has just delivered , which was an excellent one .
<2en> With my headphones on , I was able to listen to it , although I have to say , Mr President , that if I had not used them I would scarcely have been able to understand it , the House ’ s loudspeakers notwithstanding .
<2en> There is no point in you , in your characteristically amicable way , speaking your own language into the microphone to tell the Members to sit down ; the fact is that they will not understand you if what you say is not interpreted for them .
<2en> If you wanted to get them to sit down , you ought to have wielded the gavel .
<2en> I would just like to address a request to the House , and I do so as one of its own Members .
<2en> I do not think it is acceptable if we are unable to exercise the very minimum of courtesy and listen to those who address us .
<sp>
<2en> I hope that everyone here will treat what has been said seriously .
<2en> I accept the criticism and will therefore call Members to order either in a more widely-spoken EU language or using the gavel .
<2en> I have received two motions for resolutions ( 1 ) tabled pursuant to Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<2en> The debate is closed .
<2en> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I just want to raise a small housekeeping point .
<2en> Some of us have received no e-mails since 11 O ’ clock this morning , except through webmail .
<2en> I do not know how many this concerns , because there is more than one server .
<2en> However , one server is down and it was down for a while yesterday morning as well .
<2en> I believe this is a problem particularly related to Strasbourg , which , of course , is another joy of coming here .
<2en> Could you please ensure that the administration gives priority to solving this problem , which is deeply inconvenient ?
<sp>
<2en> – We shall bear it in mind , Mrs Ludford .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , it was specifically Rule 140 of the European Parliament ’ s Rules of Procedure to which I intended to refer .
<2en> This states that we are entitled to consult documents directly via Parliament ’ s internal computer system .
<2en> I should like you to review the agreement with the private company that is supposed to provide this service .
<2en> It is in both our democratic and economic interests to do so .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I should like to thank the Commissioner for her comprehensive answer to my question .
<2en> Could the Commissioner tell me whether discussions or negotiations are taking place between the major pharmaceutical companies regarding the supply of antiretroviral drugs to people in Africa ?
<2en> If so , how extensive are they ?
<2en> Has any progress been made and have these drugs been made more widely available to people ?
<sp>
<2en> I gather from the papers that discussions are being held .
<2en> However , I should like you to permit me , Madam President , to ask my colleague to give you a written answer that is to the point and states precisely what stage the discussions have reached .
<sp>
<2en> Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
<2en> That concludes Question Time .
<sp>
<2en> The next item is the report ( A6-0172 / 2006 ) by Mr Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on the consequences of the judgment of the Court of 13 September 2005 ( Case C-176 / 03 Commission v Council ) [ 2006 / 2007 ( INI ) ] .
<sp>
<2en> – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must begin by apologising for the absence of Mr Gargani , who is unable to be present by reason of illness .
<2en> Members of my own Group have asked me to stand in for him today as rapporteur and to say something about the content of this report .
<2en> I will start by observing that this ruling by the Court of Justice came as no surprise – at any rate , not to me .
<2en> There may well have been many who thought that things would not turn out this way , but I actually see this as no more than a logical conclusion , since we have for some time in the past seen the Commission adopt varying – sometimes widely divergent – approaches to legislative proposals relating to criminal law .
<2en> Drawing on my practical experience in the field of business law , I just want to point out that many past directives proposed on the basis of legal bases in the first pillar – for example , those on money-laundering and market abuse , or the provisions on insider trading – have included at least elements of criminal law .
<2en> It is in fact perfectly right and proper that the Court of Justice should , very often in the past , and even when the facts of the case were different , have worked on the principle that the issue of which legal basis should be decisive should be decided by reference to the objective of the proposal as a whole .
<2en> It was therefore perfectly obvious that the Court of Justice should , in this case , decide on the basis of a specific example from environmental law that , here too , it is not possible to take legal acts that in fact belong together and split them up in such a way that certain aspects are taken to refer to a part of the Treaties other than the actual objective that was originally in mind , where this falls under the first pillar .
<2en> The result , then , comes as no surprise to me .
<2en> What , though , are the consequences now ?
<2en> In the first place , it does nothing to change the fact that criminal law is treated primarily as a matter for the Member States , for the national level , where Europe has powers only under exceptional circumstances .
<2en> This being so , I too take the view that the European legislator – who may be able to make use of this instrument , but is not required to use it in a coercive manner – is well-advised , as a matter of principle , to refrain from legislation in matters of criminal law .
<2en> In every specific situation , decisions must be reached on a case-by-case basis , on the basis of whether or not criminal law provisions are needed in order to achieve this objective , or whether it ought to be left to the Member States to decide these matters and regulate them .
<2en> Caution , then , needs to be the order of the day for the legislator , whether that be Parliament or the Council , and that above all , I believe – and this is why the Treaties , from the outset , leave criminal law in the hands of the Member States – quite simply because the systems of criminal law in Europe are so very , very different , not only in terms of deciding what is a crime , but also in terms of how that crime should be punished .
<2en> There are Member States in which the sentence is enforced in full ; there are others in which , as a rule , only 50 % is paid ; others in which it is two-thirds ; still others in which the courts order additional penalties of a punitive nature , which , in turn , do not exist in that form in other Member States .
<2en> I do believe , then , that if Europe starts , where it is not necessary to do so , to lay down standard penalties for all manner of things , then the consequence of that will be unsystematic interventions in the criminal law systems of the Member States , and , since the usefulness of that is a matter of doubt , it is for that reason above all others that we should exercise a degree of self-restraint .
<2en> I see the report that Mr Gargani has produced , and which has been adopted by the Committee , as putting that into effect , and see that as its essential substance .
<2en> We are of course in favour of the idea that the Commission should now attempt to analyse , one by one , the proposals that need to be revised on the grounds that their division into two different legal acts no longer corresponds to the law as laid down by the Court of Justice , and should then come up with proposals as to how adjustments can be made .
<2en> As for the amendments submitted in response to the Committee on Legal Affairs ’ resolution , I am able to say , on behalf of my group , that some of these – particularly those tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – are acceptable , while others are not .
<2en> Please do not expect me to go into details , for I have agreed this with the rapporteur , but I can say in general terms that there were no fundamental differences within the Committee on Legal Affairs when it came to evaluating these issues .
<2en> The problems lie more in the nuances , perhaps in the issue of how far one should actually go in individual cases , but otherwise , the committee was in general agreement on this .
<2en> I thank the House most warmly for its attention .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report concerns an eminently cross-border issue .
<2en> There are thus good reasons for the EU countries to coordinate the measures adopted and the political decisions taken .
<2en> We have thus chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole .
<2en> We wish , however , to emphasise that isolated measures on the part of the EU are inadequate for meeting the challenges posed by a global influenza pandemic .
<2en> It is therefore extremely important that the EU act in cooperation with the World Health Organisation , or WHO .
<2en> We question individual points in the report , such as the need for the Commission to devise a comprehensive communication strategy together with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) .
<2en> We presume that the EU countries are by themselves fully capable of communicating successfully with the people , without the aid of EU bodies .
<2en> In the same way , we are opposed to the setting up of a common emergency supply of pandemic vaccines in the Community .
<2en> We believe that internationally recognised organisations such as the WHO should concern themselves with global world health issues .
<2en> We are critical of the fact that the European Parliament is in this way exploiting a significant political issue in order to extend the EU ’ s international political role .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to begin by pointing out that the confusion in people ’ s minds about avian influenza and pandemic influenza is massive .
<2en> There is much to be done , therefore , in terms of communication .
<2en> As political decision-makers , we must honour our duty to protect the citizens .
<2en> We must ensure that the resources are in place to provide an effective response to any public health threat that our societies may face .
<2en> It has been well documented that the threat of a flu pandemic is a public health issue that concerns all of us .
<2en> That being said , the likelihood of it happening is open to question .
<2en> Given that the relevant authorities believe that the risk to human health is actually small , it strikes me as crucial to establish a targeted prevention and rapid response mechanism for public health emergencies .
<2en> This should include , as the report says , a targeted plan for coordinating action at all levels and accurate , accessible communication for all citizens so as to ensure that they are prepared for any eventuality .
<2en> I accordingly voted in favour of the Amadou report .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in his book ‘ The Constitution of Europe ’ , Joseph Weiler wrote extensively about how , in the past , the Court of Justice would systematically increase the field of competences of the European institutions without there being any democratic legitimacy for it and without the Court having been given a mandate by the Member States ’ governments in this matter .
<2en> Thanks to this notorious judgment of 13 September 2005 , criminal law is now , in fact , also set to become a European competence .
<2en> As a consequence , the Court of Justice is wiping the floor with the competence restrictions of the European treaties .
<2en> The Court of Justice looks very much like a kind of judicial Absurdistan peopled by other-worldly judges who are no longer answerable to anything or anybody .
<2en> People are then surprised when our citizens , when they get the opportunity , show their displeasure by , for example , voting out the European Constitution .
<sp>
<2en> ) One of the most important new elements in the Constitution is the proposal that all EU laws be able to have common penalties attached to them .
<2en> It is perfectly logical for each Member State to determine , in the case of each law , what the price of breaking that law is to be .
<2en> That is something that the Council of Ministers has also done .
<2en> By means of an intergovernmental decision , it has unanimously determined the price to be paid for environmental crimes .
<2en> The conflict is not about the content but about the form .
<2en> The supranational European Court of Justice is not satisfied with being a court .
<2en> The judges also want to be legislators , and in this case constitutional legislators into the bargain .
<2en> What is more , they wish to legislate contrary to the unanimous decision of the Member States .
<2en> They are simply adopting a section of the Constitution that has been expressly rejected .
<2en> It is about as legal as the Beagle Boys deciding to empty Scrooge McDuck ’ s money bin .
<2en> What are the judges thinking of ?
<2en> They should be defending law and order but are themselves breaking the law .
<2en> The Court of Justice could be put in its place by the parliaments of the Member States each deciding that this judgment is of no legal effect in their countries .
<2en> We should also have a democratic procedure for appointing judges .
<sp>
<2en> This judgment acknowledges that the Commission , with Parliament ’ s support , was right to annul the framework decision on environmental protection via criminal law .
<2en> It recognises that environmental protection requires concerted action to punish the most serious breaches .
<2en> Accordingly , its objective and its substance fall under the competence of Community action programmes on the environment ( EC Treaty ) and not under the provisions of the EU Treaty on police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters .
<2en> In recognition of the fact that , broadly speaking , the Community does not have any powers on criminal matters , a useful precedent has been set whereby matters under the third pillar are communitarised and parliamentary control is strengthened in an area as sensitive as criminal law .
<2en> The consequences are enormous , in terms of both adopting future legal instruments and the legal instruments already in force .
<2en> These should be based on a new legal basis , the first pillar , which implies Parliament ’ s participation as co-legislator .
<2en> A framework decision on the environment has been annulled but its consequences will be felt beyond this area , throughout Community policies and in fundamental freedoms when it becomes necessary to make use of criminal law measures to ensure their efficiency .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> – Commissioner , can the Commission give me some additional information regarding the amendments that it plans to make to the regulation on air passenger rights in order , firstly , to take account of the hundreds of complaints that have been lodged , for example , at regional consumption centres and that testify both to the serious shortcomings , and to the poor application , of the existing regulations on the rights of these passengers ?
<2en> Secondly , how does the Commission intend to establish a precise definition of , an argument that is used systematically by airlines so as not to apply the regulation ?
<2en> Finally , I should also like to ask the Commission how it plans to take account in future of problems such as those recorded by the hundreds of French passengers who were held up recently in Turkey and Israel following failings on the part of the organisers of seat-only sales , which are not covered by any European legislation ?
<sp>
<2en> The Commission has organised three meetings with the national control bodies – on 19 May 2005 , 17 February 2006 and 14 September 2006 , which is very recent – with a view to strengthening the coordination among the various Member States and to harmonising the application of the provisions of the regulation concerned .
<2en> In the meantime , we have established a question-and-answer-type information document that will make it easier for the national control bodies to deal with the data on a daily basis .
<2en> This document was distributed in July 2006 .
<2en> As I said to you , Mr Tarabella , thanks to this critical mass of information , I could actually propose , with the communication that I am going to present before Parliament in prospect , a number of improvements enabling us to ensure that the new law that we have created to benefit passengers is properly applied .
<2en> I would say to you once again : the Directorate-General for Transport has handled 5 623 letters , which means that we can already identify certain trends .
<2en> I must say , for example , that we were pleased to observe a sharp decline in the practice of overbooking .
<2en> You are right , though : the events that took place this summer must also be taken into account .
<2en> Once I truly have an overall view of things , I hope to be able to come before this Parliament and to explain to it both what improvements have been made and what remains for us to do to ensure that these new rules are applied effectively .
<2en> I am grateful to you for having asked that question ; it is also an incentive for me to demonstrate even greater vigilance .
<sp>
<2en> It is just a question about airline operators .
<2en> I understand that they are the ones that have to tell passengers what their rights are , but in various instances , with Air France in particular , we are told that it is not up to the airline operator .
<2en> What is the Commission doing to make sure that airline operators take their responsibilities seriously ?
<2en> I had to intervene on behalf of several passengers because they were told that they would not get overnight accommodation , for instance .
<2en> I told them that was wrong and that the new law said that they were entitled to that compensation .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , Mrs Lynne , I stated that we were going to ask an audit body to review the situation with regard to denied boarding , cancellations and delays , the application of the regulation by airline operators and the national authorities , and the degree of independence of the national control bodies from the national aviation authorities .
<2en> You are quite right .
<2en> It is not just a question of passengers having rights ; it is a question of airline operators and the national authorities being able to really make the people concerned aware of those rights .
<2en> Moreover , the study will be conducted in cooperation with airline operators , consumer and passenger associations , and the national authorities .
<2en> I personally believe that , in the light of this study , we shall be far more able in future to monitor passenger information , which is in fact a prerequisite for enforcing these new rules .
<sp>
<2en> Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
<2en> Questions 63 , 64 and 77 will not be answered because they deal with topics that are already included in the order of business for the current part-session .
<2en> That concludes questions to the Commission .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is Question Time ( B6-0125 / 2007 ) .
<en> The following questions are addressed to the Council .
<en> Subject : EU taxation policy
<en> The taxation policy pursued by the Member States should be consistent with the Community 's objectives in terms of job creation , EU competitiveness , the single market and free movement of capital .
<en> The 27 Member States are solely responsible for the planning and implementation of direct taxation policy , while the Community rules governing individual areas of taxation policy in the Union require the unanimity of the 27 for any decision-making .
<en> Value added tax ( VAT ) on products has become quite a complicated matter in recent years .
<en> In particular , VAT in the Member States ranges from 3 % in Luxembourg to 25 % in Denmark .
<en> Will the Council say whether the EU is moving closer to adopting a common system for value added tax , what stage has been reached in discussions to date and what the Member States ' intentions are concerning the adoption of a common rate of VAT ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( DE ) Madam President , the common system of value-added tax was established in 1967 by the first and second VAT Directives .
<en> These two directives prescribed the general structures of the system .
<en> The detailed provisions governing the application of the common VAT system were introduced in 1977 with the adoption of the sixth VAT Directive .
<en> This directive has since been subject to numerous amendments , most of which were occasioned by the creation of the single market and the accompanying removal of tax barriers between Member States .
<en> On 1 January 2007 the sixth directive was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value-added tax , which incorporates all of the statutory amendments to the original directive .
<en> As far as VAT rates are concerned , the directive establishes the principle of applying a standard rate plus one or two reduced rates .
<en> The standard rate must be at least 15 % .
<en> This minimum rate is fixed until 31 December 2010 .
<en> The reduced rates , which must amount to at least 5 % , are applicable to goods and services defined in the directive .
<en> The directive also provides for certain exceptions to this general rule and for transitional arrangements , allowing the Member States to respond to specific situations .
<en> So that the effects of the reduced rates can be more accurately assessed , the directive also lays down that , by 30 June 2007 at the latest , the Commission is to present to the European Parliament and the Council an overall assessment report on the impact of reduced rates applying to locally provided services , focusing especially on job creation , economic growth and the proper functioning of the internal market and based on a study carried out by an independent economic think-tank .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , Minister , as the Commission has said , you must have information on the impact on economic prosperity and job creation in the Member States from different value added tax rates at your disposal and make it known by 30 June 2007 .
<en> It is only to be expected that different VAT rates have a strong impact on sectors of the internal market and on the flourishing of the economies in the Member States , with the result that individual economic indicators are affected and inequalities in the economy and society are exacerbated .
<en> I ask you , Minister , do you already know the impact different VAT rates have and , if you do , what is it ?
<en> Finally , what policies is the Council considering in order to mitigate the adverse repercussions of these differences ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr Mavrommatis , I also said that there has been a variety of developments and decisions within the scope that exists for this in the European Union .
<2en> It should be particularly useful in that , when the report of the expert group is presented , we shall have the facts on the table and be able to assess whether or not there are obstacles , as it were , to the functioning of the internal market , and what has been the impact on certain sectors to which reduced rates have applied in the past .
<2en> I am sure you will understand that we ought to wait for this report .
<2en> After that , we - the Council and Parliament - must conduct an assessment together .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President-in-Office , I should like to extend the question a little .
<en> The attempts to achieve uniform or harmonised VAT rates in Europe are admirable , but surely the objective of European tax policy should be the ultimate achievement of uniform , or at least comparable , taxation rates and taxes throughout the European Union .
<en> I should be interested to hear what kind of discussion there has been on this issue in the Council in general , whether this issue has been approached , and if so , how .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , a debate concerning such an important subject is bound to touch on other topics that are directly or indirectly related .
<en> Allow me to make a few general comments on European solidarity , on the Solidarity Fund and on some events that may provide lessons for the future .
<en> In 2002 I had the experience of leading a country that was struck by terrible floods , together with the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria .
<en> It was the scale of that disaster that provided the incentive for the creation of the Solidarity Fund .
<en> The disaster occurred in August and the first payments were received by the Czech Republic the following January .
<en> I can say without hesitation that it was incredibly fast : starting from zero , formulating a political concept , setting up the structure and putting the aid into practice .
<en> That aid was significant and it was very much appreciated in our country .
<en> I have been aware ever since of the importance of solidarity , not just on financial terms , but also in general .
<en> I will never forget those Danish and French fire-fighters and the many people from all other parts of Europe who played their part in helping us to cope with that disaster .
<en> My experience made me realise that no matter how well organised a country may be , there will always be disasters that go beyond its own borders .
<en> No country can permanently maintain the level of resources necessary to cope with such extreme situations .
<en> I therefore believe that it is right to strive to find ways and means that allow us to act in such situations in a coordinated manner at EU level .
<en> This is absolutely crucial .
<en> The concrete form it will take may still be open to discussion .
<en> What is evident , however , is that the capability to react and mobilise all of the possible resources at EU level or through the EU is enormously important and is still insufficient at present .
<en> There has been little mention of the fact that Bulgaria did not receive any assistance .
<en> The capacity was simply exhausted .
<en> There was no hidden deliberation : there were just no aircraft ; there was not enough trained personnel .
<en> As regards the aid to Greece specifically , it is now clear that the assistance is ready .
<en> It will be implemented at the request of the Greek Government .
<en> In any case , all of the Commission bodies will make every effort to ensure that the aid is implemented as quickly and as effectively as possible .
<en> Allow me now to reiterate briefly what I said in my opening statement .
<en> We should consider the Solidarity Fund , which since its establishment has already been mobilised in at least 20 or 30 cases .
<en> It was created in the aftermath of the floods .
<en> It has intervened or helped in cases of devastating hurricanes , such as Hurricanes Gudrun and Kyril .
<en> It will now be used to provide assistance in relation to these devastating forest fires .
<en> Such are the possibilities of the Structural Funds , which can be restructured as a result of new experiences and new needs , and we are prepared to do just that , galvanised , among other things , by Commissioner Hübner 's visit to Greece .
<en> Another important lesson I have learnt is that personal experience of such disasters is worth a multitude of television documentaries .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , in our present debate we have touched upon the problems of climate change , prevention , flood prevention , the environmental protection strategy , urban planning and development , and many others .
<en> All these matters are undoubtedly interconnected .
<en> That is why it is so important to look for answers at a European level , which is , after all , what we are doing here .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , let me conclude my speech with a few simple words .
<en> Solidarity is necessary , and when you experience it , you feel , even in very difficult situations , that you are much stronger than you ever expected .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> Before concluding the debate , I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken , from all the political groups , for their valuable contributions .
<en> I was born in Peschici , one of the villages in southern Italy that was most severely affected by this summer 's fires .
<en> Three of those who died in the fires came from there .
<en> I understand the pain and consternation expressed by many Members and am grateful to you all for being so resolute and to the point .
<en> I hope that the Council will be equal to the task of addressing the concerns of Parliament and the Commission .
<en> I have received five motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Tuesday .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the images of the serious fires in Greece haunted us throughout the entire summer .
<en> The swift assistance provided by other EU countries to tackle the fires and the EU 's current offer of assistance payments will not be forgotten in Greece .
<en> However , there is something that has been forgotten in Greece for decades , and this brings me to the cause of the recent disaster : namely the need to set up a land register .
<en> Greece has been obliged by the EU to act here for some time , but no action has been taken yet .
<en> As a consequence , large areas of the Greek forest have remained common land , in effect a no-man 's-land .
<en> Anyone who burned a section of forest and put a cabin on it could be certain that there would be no comeback ; indeed , his action would be legalised after the fact .
<en> This situation has made arson the national sport .
<en> The EU is willing to help the Greek people now , but Greece must take a good look at itself and if necessary give itself a rap on the knuckles .
<en> Specifically , this means that if Greece does not complete its land register by 31 August 2008 , not only will the penalties accumulated - which run into millions - finally be due ; other payments must be considered as well .
<en> As the rapporteur for the transparency of agricultural expenditure in the EU , I will be following this very closely .
<sp>
<en> in writing - Whilst I appreciate the scale of devastation caused by the Greek forests fires and regret the lives lost within this incident , I must stress that this is indeed a resolution on natural disasters .
<en> Therefore I am disappointed that the Commissioner has not made any reference to the floods which occurred in the UK .
<en> They caused widespread damage across the country including in my region , the West Midlands .
<en> In Worcestershire over 5 000 homes and business were affected and more than 2 000 people were temporarily displaced .
<en> The impact on infrastructure has been significant , with many roads waterlogged for weeks afterwards and some that have totally disappeared .
<en> Agriculture was also severely affected and the impact of this is not confined to the loss of produce but also loss of crops , grazing land and next year 's yield .
<en> Therefore I would urge the Commission to ensure that the UK 's application for funding assistance from the Solidarity Fund is also brought forward to help alleviate some of the immediate consequences of the floods .
<en> It is imperative that the systems enabling access to funds are streamlined and that any proposed EU rapid reaction body to assist Member States also covers extreme flooding .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) The natural disasters in the summer .
<en> Climate change has turned this summer into a catalogue of catastrophes .
<en> Record floods , droughts and forest fires have caused devastation across Europe .
<en> In Hungary a significant proportion of the maize crop was destroyed due to drought , and more than 400 hectares fell victim to flames in forest fires even though our fire-fighters bravely stood their ground in Hungary - and in Greece too .
<en> Now the EU has to draw the right lessons from these events .
<en> I would like to remind you that arson , deliberate fire-raising , is suspected in the case of the conflagrations both in Greece and in Sicily .
<en> It is of great importance that the damage caused in the course of any incident of arson where protected natural assets are damaged or destroyed does not lead to a change in the official status of these areas .
<en> If it is possible to circumvent the authorities with a deliberately discarded cigarette butt , and if permits , for example building permits , rejected for environment protection reasons can thus be acquired , then soon the whole of Europe will be in flames .
<en> The European Union and its Member States must put particular focus on the proper restoration and reconstruction of these devastated areas .
<en> Finally , I would draw attention to one small , unfortunately administrative shortcoming .
<en> While it used to be possible , before putting early assistance into place , to get disaster relief funds from the Union quite quickly , even within two months , it now takes almost one year .
<en> I hope that the Union will make changes to this practice and aid will once again be processed quickly .

<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The frequency , scale , complexity and impact of natural disasters have increased substantially throughout Europe in recent years .
<en> The summer of 2007 was marred by massive forest fires and severe flooding , resulting in substantial material and environmental damage .
<en> These natural disasters have made it clear , once again , that the existing national resources are reaching their limits , both financially and technically .
<en> A well-functioning , efficient and rapid-reaction European civil protection mechanism is therefore an urgent necessity .
<en> For that reason , I call for effective engagement from Europe and appeal to the Commission to adopt appropriate measures .
<en> Everyone remembers the flood disasters in Central Europe in 1999 , 2001 and 2005 and the devastation they caused in Austria and its neighbouring countries .
<en> The EU 's disaster relief fund was established in response .
<en> The time has now come to make this fund as flexible as possible and to mobilise it without delay .
<en> The development of a crisis reaction mechanism will also facilitate a rapid response in larger-scale emergency situations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I support the view expressed in the motion for a resolution and I also wish to express my solidarity with the Greek people affected by this disaster .
<en> The EU ought to provide consequent aid to Greece as soon as possible , and seriously improve its capacities and means in terms of civil protection and emergency action .
<en> Regrettably , the weather has been merciless in other European countries this summer .
<en> Cyclone Dean , with winds blowing at over 200 km / h , was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the Antilles Arc in more than 20 years : it caused extensive damage to the agricultural sector and to the electricity and telecommunications networks in Martinique and Guadeloupe , two of the EU 's ultraperipheral regions .
<en> I urge the European Commission to take the required measures to support the agricultural sector in Martinique and Guadeloupe , especially the banana and sugar cane sectors , after their fruit plantations were almost completely destroyed , with disturbing social , economic and human consequences .
<en> It is essential that the new Solidarity Fund and the enhanced EuropeAid programme enter into force as soon as possible .

<en> I regret that the Council , while accepting Parliament 's positions , rejected the amendments aimed at giving Parliament the possibility of blocking Commission decisions on implementation of the programme , notably when annual priorities are chosen .
<en> I am also sorry that in its statement in plenary the European Commission felt it appropriate to state that its commitment to transmit to the European Parliament the necessary information relating to the draft annual work programmes was an exceptional measure .

<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The problem of drug addiction requires the adoption of a set of cross-cutting policies encompassing , among other aspects , prevention , treatment and reintegration , as well as the fight against drug trafficking , organised crime and money laundering .
<en> These public policies are top priority as drug addiction has serious human and social consequences , particularly among the younger generations .
<en> They must be accompanied by other public policies aimed at improving people 's living conditions by guaranteeing access to healthcare , food , housing , schooling , educational success and stable employment , and by protecting the rights to a fair wage , to freedom of creation and cultural enjoyment , and to sports .

<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the outstanding report by my excellent Czech colleague Miroslav Ouzký on the International Health Regulations , revised in 2005 by the General Assembly of the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
<en> The purpose of these Regulations is to prevent the spread of diseases and to protect citizens against these diseases without causing unnecessary and costly interference with international trade .
<en> This international health mechanism must be implemented urgently in a coordinated fashion within the European Community because infectious diseases , as my admirable French colleague Françoise Grossetête points out , represent a threat and a challenge for every country .
<en> Such health questions are once again going to raise the question of the quality of the controls at our external borders as regards both people and goods .
<en> It is essential to support the development of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) , established in 2004 , and the European early warning and response system for public health threats , which must encourage rapid and coherent application in the EU Member States of the International Health Regulations ( IHR ) .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SK ) Since we did not have a debate on the report by our colleague Mr Ouzký on the International Health Regulations , I would like to express my opinion on this matter at least in this way .
<en> The increase in international trade and greater mobility within the EU heighten the danger of international outbreaks of infectious diseases within the EU or their transmission to Europe from more distant continents .
<en> The response to such epidemics , using defensive methods , must be integrated and coordinated if it is to be effective .
<en> Today in the European Union we have the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) : combating mass epidemics is part of its duty .
<en> At the same time the Member States are members of the World Health Organisation , which has issued the International Health Regulations : they also deal with the fight against diseases that can spread from one country to another one .
<en> There is a Commission Decision on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases .
<en> The EU also has a few financial tools at its disposal , for example the European Union Solidarity Fund and the action programme for public health as a new instrument for early warning and response in the case of serious emergencies .
<en> At the same time , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , the Member States have control over their health services .
<en> Given this complex system of abundant legislation at several levels , it will be difficult to respond quickly and unanimously if there is an epidemic risk .
<en> The EU and Member State systems need to be better connected so that we do not find ourselves in a situation whereby we have European legislation that will not match the preparedness of the Member States to respond quickly .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The International Health Regulations adopted by the WHO ( World Health Organisation ) are a new instrument aimed at protecting world health .
<en> They replace the former post-war regulations which concentrated on border control , specifically the health control of ships and their crews , and which included international vaccination against yellow fever , to which other vaccinations were subsequently added .
<en> Emerging public health issues such as tuberculosis and malaria and even new ones such as bird flu and the risk of pandemic flu have made international cooperation and information on public health even more urgent .
<en> Recent epidemics and pandemic threats have shown that no countries or regions are immune to health problems nor is it possible to guarantee this .
<en> These new Regulations encourage the exchange of information and urge countries to coordinate their responses to global threats , recognising that all countries are important and that mutual aid is essential .
<en> In Portugal the health surveillance of borders , international vaccination and traveller advice have been receiving less and less attention , particularly due to the current government 's closure of the Regional Public Health Centres .
<en> Without a proper national surveillance system , the attention paid to these areas will continue to be mediocre .

<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very keen to draw your attention to the resolution that was adopted last Thursday in the Slovak Parliament .
<en> That resolution does not reflect a European spirit , it does not reflect a spirit of reconciliation and understanding , but instead says that the decrees that came into force after the Second World War , the Beneš decrees , are still fully applicable today .
<en> The explanatory statement equates the Hungarian and German minority with traitors and enemies .
<en> I want to point out that we as a European Parliament - and I have already written to the President too - should send out a clear signal that this is not the spirit that should inspire us in Europe but that we should be working together on the construction of Europe and building up a common future .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I am loathe to speak on this matter , but I have a request to all Members taking part , whether it be Mr Ferber , or Mr Maňka , who belongs to my Group .
<en> What has been happening in some EU Member States and their parliaments over the past weeks gives cause for concern .
<en> Every one of us in this House knows that even if the Slovak Parliament adopts a resolution of this kind , the Beneš decrees can no longer have any legal effect .
<en> On their accession to the European Union , all Member States who join it have committed themselves to basic values , which makes any further discussion of the issue Mr Ferber has brought up unnecessary .
<en> That brings us up against the question : what are we as a European Parliament doing to calm the situation down ?
<en> In my view we should not start interpreting the text - and incidentally I did not find the phrases you used in the text - but take a different approach .
<en> The European Parliament , instead of fuelling the tensions with controversial debates , could decide to take a different approach and apply the procedures for resolving disputes that we use in our own everyday work in this case too .
<en> That would mean saying that the mission of this Parliament 60 years after the end of the war is not to conjure up the ghosts of 1945 , but instead to convey the spirit of cooperation of 2007 .
<en> One way to do this would be through a dialogue , which does not have to take place here in plenary .
<en> I therefore call on all colleagues in my Group , as in your Group and all the other Groups , to try to calm the situation down instead of aggravating it by statements designed for media effect , which is what I think they are .
<sp>
<en> We are not holding a debate now .
<en> Mr Ferber , there is no provision for Members to answer one another .
<en> ( Heckling )
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I would ask Members to take note of what this item on the agenda is actually about .
<en> If Mr Schulz feels he has to comment on every second or third speech , that is his problem .
<en> But if he is interested in having a real debate here , then I would be pleased if he would support our Group 's request to hold a debate on this subject in this House at the earliest opportunity .
<en> ( Exchange of views with microphones switched off )
<sp>
<en> I hope this matter will be resolved amicably .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , with the agreement of the political groups , and in accordance with our Rules of Procedure , I propose the following amendments to the agenda for the current part-session .
<en> Firstly , I propose that the vote on the motions for resolutions tabled to close the debate on the EU-Russia Summit be moved to the next part-session in Brussels .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I rise on a point of order under Rule 166 , and with reference to Rules 45 , 77 , 89 , 113 and 155 .
<en> We took a decision yesterday that we would have a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit this week , and my Group believes that we should stick to that .
<en> I know there is an attempt to try to revote that decision , but I hope the House will sensibly see off such a narrow-minded approach to politics .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> Are there any other comments ?
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , this now also concerns fellow Members .
<en> We were not informed about this application .
<en> There was a communication problem here yesterday .
<en> Neither the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats nor my group were informed of this request .
<en> This is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting .
<en> We have both - that is , my fellow Member , Mr Daul , and I - put forward the proposal this morning that we flesh out this resolution with care .
<en> We note the desire for a resolution and accept it on condition that we flesh it out with care .
<en> After the summit we shall also have all the information available , hence the deferral of the proposal until after the summit .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I do not know how strong communications are within the large groups .
<en> We have always said that we want a resolution - the General Secretaries have been informed of this .
<en> We have said that if you speak out against this , we shall do so at the vote on Monday morning , as is our right .
<en> We have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you , it is not our problem , but yours .
<en> As regards the content : a new law against extremists , for example , has been adopted in Russia in recent weeks that clearly restricts freedom of the press and freedom of opinion .
<en> We therefore want the resolution to be adopted before the summit to enable the EU to state our position on the situation in Russia through this resolution .
<en> We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit , but this Parliament , which wants to be political , should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament .

<en> rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , I have a request to make on behalf of all democratically minded people .
<en> It is unacceptable for Members of the European Parliament to be dubbed the ' cancer of Europe ' , in other words to be called after a deadly disease .
<en> This did not happen in Budapest , like the insult to which Mr Schulz referred yesterday , but in Brussels .
<en> In his speech in the plenary chamber of this House , a Member of the European Parliament described critics of the EU as a cancer .
<en> The Member in question was Othmar Karas , Vice-President of the EPP Group .
<en> He said it at the plenary sitting of 10 October 2007 .
<en> I demand ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker . )
<sp>
<en> That did not pertain to the report .
<en> All I will say on that point is that Members of Parliament should always be exemplary in their words and actions .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think that what will be important is to use the next few weeks to shape the agreement so that everyone can be happy with it .
<en> It is an agreement of great importance and it has immense symbolic resonance .
<en> It is not just about negotiating a free trade agreement for the regions and countries of Africa and bringing them closer to Europe .
<en> It is also about producing an agreement for a real development round , which fights poverty and genuinely shows that the European Union is in a position to negotiate an agreement in a way which puts the African countries at their ease and helps them feel a bond with the European Union .
<en> There are several points which are important , as you yourself said , and you mentioned a number of them .
<en> We must ensure that the regional agreements genuinely benefit the countries concerned .
<en> We must ensure that the non-LCD countries also get an agreement and are not left out , and we must ensure that all the countries can develop in the right direction .
<en> The agreement which you proposed , in the form of a two-step approach , must also guarantee that no one is left out , so that ultimately , we are genuinely moving in the right direction , which is still not guaranteed today .
<en> Mr Markov , we should utilise the opportunity available to us now as a result of not adopting the resolution tomorrow , in order to reach a consensus in Parliament , and I think we have enough points of convergence for that to happen .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I should like to thank all who contributed to this interesting debate .
<en> I am sure that we see it as an ongoing process .
<en> I am not part of it directly or personally but , for an agreement , you need goodwill on both sides and for many partners to agree .
<en> As I said in my introductory statement , we are working in a pragmatic and flexible way .
<en> Those who are ready or willing to follow the same approach follow not to the detriment of the others , but for the gradual achievement which is important for all regions and for international trade as a whole .
<en> There were some questions or criticisms about the tone of the negotiations .
<en> I want to assure you that it is in a spirit of partnership .
<en> We take into account , in this spirit of partnership , the development objectives and the constraints on our partners .
<en> Some questions were about goods-only deals .
<en> The stepping-stone agreements lead towards comprehensive EPAs and these are supportive of ACP development and regional integration .
<en> So we are not losing sight of the overall picture and overall needs of our partner countries and regions .
<en> I do not want to repeat many of the points I made at the beginning , but the process continues .
<en> Sometimes a deadline brings pressure to find a solution during the last few days or weeks , and we are making real progress .
<en> I quoted many names and countries where we have recently initialled stepping-stone agreements , and we will continue doing so , but our interest is really in finding solutions .
<en> Processes will continue , because there is more than one stage in this situation .
<en> As I said , after 1 January , we will continue working on issues like services , investment and other trade-related areas .
<en> I believe that the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week will support the proposal for a regulation of the Community to implement the market access which has been offered to the ACP .
<en> As I said , it is the best ever offer in a bilateral agreement .
<en> We are being not only open but also very constructive .
<en> The strategy the Commission proposed , and I tried to describe , was fully confirmed by the Council - all 27 countries - and , in this spirit of partnership and this constructive manner , we will continue .
<en> The objective is really a fully-fledged economic partnership agreement .
<en> This will be a catalyst for regional integration .
<en> Once the first-step agreements are concluded , we will continue towards this objective .
<en> Nobody is left out or forgotten in this process .
<en> We not only have in mind , but support very actively , the least developed countries .
<en> I think that is all I can say for now , either in response to questions or by way of confirmation , but I am sure that this House will come back to this point in the coming weeks and months , because this is also about the timing of our agreements .
<sp>
<en> I have received four motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on 12 December 2007 .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We have reached a critical period for the economic partnership agreements ( EPAs ) .
<en> A WTO-compliant agreement is crucial for the non-least developed ACP countries .
<en> It is unfortunate that a relationship of trust between the two sides has not always been evident .
<en> No country should feel pressurised into entering an agreement .
<en> The Commission should have done more to make the negotiations more inclusive .
<en> The EU is the most important trading partner for most ACP countries .
<en> The EU imported goods worth a total of EUR 28 billion from the ACP countries in 2004 .
<en> This amounts to double the amount of development assistance that was made available through the ninth EDF to the ACP region , from 2000 to 2007 .
<en> Trade , and not aid , is the key for sustainable economic growth and development .
<en> While no one can deny that many ACP countries face considerable challenges , if the EPAs are framed correctly they should be seen as an opportunity for the ACP .
<en> The European Union should be fully supportive of the development agenda that shall accompany any EPA agreement .
<en> Interim deals should be put in place to ensure that there will be no disruption to trade and that the livelihood of millions will not be put at risk .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I must say first of all that our vote against is a protest against postponement of the entry into force of a directive on workers ' health and safety , a directive that in this case was adopted in 2004 which lays down the exposure limit values of workers to electric , magnetic and electromagnetic fields , and prevention , information and training measures .
<en> The European Commission is now proposing a new directive with the sole aim of postponing the transposition of that directive by four years .
<en> It is truly odd for the European Commission to be tabling this proposal for a postponement .
<en> It claims in justification that the medical community has reported its concerns on the implementation of the Directive and that various studies have now been commissioned .
<en> It is a pity that similar concern regarding the effects of this Directive is not shown in relation to the effects of other legal instruments and policy guidelines which seek to liberalise public goods and services and to deregulate labour relations and workers ' rights .
<en> Only when workers ' rights and health are being protected does the European Commission ask for more studies to postpone implementation .
<en> It is unacceptable .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome the report on exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents .
<en> The possible consequences which the transposition of the 2004 directive , outlining minimum safety standards for those using physical agents , could have on the development and use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) in medicine make the recommendations of the report sound and logical .
<en> With the emergence of new studies calling into question the basis on which the directive 's recommendations are based , we must allow time for this new information and the directive to be analysed .
<en> I therefore support the call to postpone the deadline of 30 April 2008 by four years , and have voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SK ) I would like to stress that the demand for improving the health and safety of workers in the workplace is based , first and foremost , on risk assessment .
<en> In cases where workers are employed in an environment where they are exposed to agents that pose a health risk , a risk assessment is one of the employer 's fundamental duties .
<en> If a risk assessment reveals that there may be a risk , it is necessary to implement measures that will either eliminate the risk or reduce it to the lowest possible level .
<en> In my opinion , it is important to implement these measures at source .
<en> Other steps that can be taken are , for example , offering a choice of different working methods , technical measures to reduce the emissions , changing the design of workplaces and workstations , limiting the duration and intensity of exposure , making adequate personal protection equipment available , etc .
<en> I agree that if a worker 's medical examination shows that there is a specific health risk , it is the duty of the employer to provide health care for such workers .
<en> Preventive medical check-ups are part of the health care package : their goal is to identify at an early stage changes to one 's health and to prevent damage to one 's health as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields .
<en> Depending on the results , the risk assessment may be reviewed and additional measures may be implemented .
<en> In conclusion , I would like to say that as a doctor I am pleased that Directive 2004 / 40 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements concerning the establishment of action values and exposure limit values for individual electromagnetic fields , as well as requirements for the protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to electromagnetic fields in the course of their work .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Artificial electromagnetic waves have a significant impact on the health of Europe 's citizens , and above all on the health of workers , who need to be protected from electromagnetic fields just as they are already protected by two EU directives fixing limit values for exposure to noise and vibration .
<en> The electromagnetic fields emitted both by radios and electronic appliances and by various telephonic devices - portable transmitters and telephones , fixed-base and wi-fi mobiles - are by no means harmless !
<en> That is the finding of the recent BioInitiative report , and its conclusions are indisputable : the risks include forms of cancer , Alzheimer 's disease and nervous problems caused by chronic or excessive exposure to electromagnetic waves .
<en> It is a health risk that has recently been highlighted by the European Environment Agency .
<en> This is why I voted in favour of the report by Committee Chairman Jan Andersson , which aims to protect workers ' health while taking account of the medical community 's concerns about the compatibility of Community law with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technology .
<en> MRI scanning is an essential medical procedure for certain patients , and in my view it should have been made the subject of a derogation , instead of postponing application of the entire directive for four years !
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Although this is a codification procedure that does not alter existing legislation in any way , the underlying question raised is the need for a set of Community directives on a set of issues concerning tractors and other motor vehicles and their trailers , as can be seen from the codified version of several reports put to the vote in Parliament today .
<en> This is an area in which I believe Community legislation is excessive .
<en> The existence of general legislation on motor vehicles covering general aspects would probably suffice , without the need to reproduce directives relating to each of these areas , as happens now , examples of which are : the suppression of radio interference produced by agricultural or forestry tractors ( electromagnetic compatibility ) ; driver-perceived noise level of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors ; rear registration plate lamps for motor vehicles and their trailers .
<en> The vote in favour of codification does not alter this opinion in any way .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) The resolution on the Lisbon Strategy contains many important provisions for business people and consumers .
<en> One initiative that is particularly worthy of note and support is the Small Business Act initiative , which presents the philosophy of the ' think small first ' principle .
<en> I hope that this initiative will be implemented effectively and promptly , with the active involvement of interested parties .
<en> There is no need for me to remind you here of the significance of the role of small and medium-sized businesses in economic life , or how important it is for the future of Europe that they are granted a special and privileged status .
<en> I would also like to draw attention to the protection of intellectual rights .
<en> We are all aware that , in comparison with the United States , Europe 's patent system with its exceptional lack of cohesion is a big headache for some European countries clearly holding back innovation and research on a wide front , and that is harming the whole continent .
<en> It is therefore important to draw up joint proposals and solutions for the current situation so that all EU consumers might have the benefit of new and modern products at a price that matches the purchasing powers of the average consumer .
<sp>
<2en> I abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Lisbon agenda .
<2en> I was somewhat surprised to read paragraph 3 in particular .
<2en> From it we learn that in order to guarantee the success of this agenda , we also need to strengthen economic growth in Europe .
<2en> It is about that one little word : also .
<2en> Up to now I was living in the conviction that growth was the main aim , and that the point was to catch up with certain countries and not let others catch up with us .
<2en> Careful reading of the draft resolution indicates that unfortunately this is not just a routine oversight , but a confirmation of a rule .
<2en> In this text we find statements that might successfully be placed in dozens of other resolutions .
<2en> Often these are matters that undoubtedly put the brakes on such growth .
<2en> What we have in effect is a wish list that we could draw up for ourselves on many other occasions , and not just when discussing the Lisbon agenda .
<2en> There is one exception , however : progress in the introduction of the Lisbon agenda .
<2en> This fragment of the resolution is very important , but sadly the conclusions are not optimistic .
<2en> We do not know how to measure this progress , if indeed there has been any .
<2en> There is no appropriate monitoring .
<2en> This means that our work lacks points of reference .
<2en> We have problems with evaluation .
<2en> We do not know whether we are forging ahead or standing on the spot .
<2en> I think that we as a Parliament should be working on this above all .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) On Monday , the European Parliament Committee on Industry , Research and Energy gave the green light to the final acceptance of the statutory foundations for the EIT .
<en> That means that all the questions about financing and the EIT 's internal organisation have been dealt with , and it is ready for launch .
<en> The European Institute of Innovation and Technology is a central component in achieving more for our economy , more for science and more for sustainable jobs in Europe .
<en> Therefore , it is essential that a decision on the location of the EIT be made quickly .
<en> I call upon the EU Heads of State or Government to agree on a defined time frame for this decision at the Spring European Council .
<en> The decision must be made by the EU summit in June , at the latest .
<en> The Austrian Federal Chancellor , Mr Gusenbauer , must also be involved in setting the time frame , since Austria submitted a very appropriate application .
<en> The time frame for this decision must be determined at the spring summit and form part of the summit outcome document .
<en> Given Vienna 's excellent application to host the EIT , Chancellor Gusenbauer has considerable responsibility to ensure that the decision is made quickly and a precise time frame is set .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - With the renewal of the Lisbon strategy I stress the need for a real update of the Integrated Policy Guidelines , along with a greater role for the European Parliament in monitoring how the strategy is followed up .
<en> The focus should be on achieving a socially sensitive Europe that deals with the current economic problems we face without isolating those most vulnerable .
<en> The need for enforcement of a minimum wage in all Member States is one of the key ways that we can ensure that all European citizens enjoy a decent basic standard of living .
<en> I am satisfied with the resolution and have voted in favour of it .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The centre-right and centre-left political groupings are competing with each other over which can lend more support to the interests and choices of big business .
<en> They are even surpassing the Commission in promoting the anti-worker , anti-popular Lisbon Strategy .
<en> This disgraceful resolution does not even shed crocodile tears over poverty or social exclusion .
<en> On the contrary , it demands that reforms be carried out in labour markets and social insurance systems ; it emphasises the Commission 's guidelines by requesting that the directives on the organization of working time and working conditions for temporary workers be adopted ; it asks Member States to place EU competitiveness at the core of their policies and to make the completion of the single market their most important economic and political priority .
<en> According to the resolution , the most suitable tool for promoting these and other anti-worker measures and policies is class cooperation , which will succeed through a widening of social dialogue and the establishment of a climate of trust between enterprises and employees .
<en> Employees have endured seven years of implementation of this strategy .
<en> As a result , their living standards , employment , pension and social rights have worsened .
<en> This is why they are rejecting the Lisbon Strategy and opposing the interests of capital .
<en> We feel the same about the EU , which is serving those interests .

<en> Mr President , it is very good to see you back in your chair listening to these explanations of vote , which I know you enjoy so much .
<en> I would also like to say I appreciate the kindness and understanding of your staff and services and interpreters this week whilst we have been making these explanations of vote .
<en> I voted against this particular report for a whole bunch of reasons .
<en> Firstly , I believe in tax competition .
<en> I do not believe tax harmonisation or tax should be a competence of these institutions at all .
<en> Secondly , this week , in my country , the Chancellor of the Exchequer has imposed higher fuel taxes on British car and freight drivers without understanding the consequences of his actions .
<en> I should like to raise a separate problem .
<en> I am running a campaign with the Northampton Chronicle and Echo for the people who live in that vicinity in my region , where we are being charged more for our fuel than all the other major towns around .
<en> I wish to highlight that there are other problems within the fuel market , let alone the problems to do with tax .

<en> Mr President , I would like to echo the comments of my colleague in thanking you , the staff and the interpreters for your kind patience as we seek to deliver these explanations of vote , which at times may be rather entertaining and at times rather boring for you .
<en> I understand that .
<en> But that is the great contrast in this place .
<en> Now , let us talk about tax competition .
<en> We talk about creating the world 's largest single market here , and we talk about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world , and we talk about the world competition , yet what do we do when it comes to tax competition ?
<en> Well , as it actually says in the explanatory statement , the best way to address the problem of competition would be through full harmonisation .
<en> So here we are , seeing competition as a problem , while at the same time talking about the need for a more competitive economy .
<en> This should not be a competence of the EU .
<en> It is a competence of Member States , and we should leave it as such , because the best way to ensure a competitive economy is to make sure that we have tax competition , not harmonisation .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I voted against .
<en> The European Union has no interest in funding Iraq .
<en> There are other countries in Europe itself that would benefit much more from such aid .
<en> The Caritas Europa report shows that in 14 European countries - including Poland , Austria , Germany and Britain - single parents , especially women , are particularly affected by poverty .
<en> According to an EU report Poland , with 26 % , has the highest percentage of children living in poverty of all the EU countries .
<en> One Pole in five ( 19 % ) lives below the poverty line .
<en> And 22 % of Polish children with at least one working parent are threatened by poverty .
<en> That is the highest figure for Europe .
<en> Thirteen percent of Poles in employment are threatened by poverty .
<en> In Austria , 47 % of unemployed single parents live in chronic poverty .
<en> Let us concentrate our efforts on Europe .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , yesterday when you were in the chair I emphasised how much I always enjoy reading the reports by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in this place and wonder why it exists .
<en> To prove this point today we have a report whose findings are more coherent with somebody who watched too much Prisoner : Cell Block H as a child than on the actual facts of the situation of women in prisons - and whether that should be a competence of this place anyway .
<en> For example , in recital Q , it says : ' whereas the increased number of women in prison is partly due to the worsening economic conditions of women ' .
<en> I think , and I have checked with the statistics from a number of countries in the European Union , the number is going up simply because the population is going up .
<en> In fact , the proportion of women in prison across Europe is dropping .
<en> It says here that access to health care of all kinds should be provided to a very high quality in prisons .
<en> Yes , that is absolutely right .
<en> But there are plenty of elderly women in my constituency who would love to have the same benefits of health-care provision that are provided to women inmates in prisons throughout the UK .
<en> So that is why I have abstained on the report .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) I pointed yesterday to Turkey 's unassailable position as an aspiring Member State and this report merely confirms that special status .
<en> For weeks Turkey has been bombing the north of Iraq and ten thousand Turkish troops have invaded the country .
<en> And instead of clearly condemning this aggression what does Parliament do ?
<en> It politely asks Turkey to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq .
<en> All rules , all principles , all guidelines and criteria have to step aside for Turkish accession , from the Copenhagen criteria to international law and its ban on the use of aggression .
<en> Turkey regards itself as above the law , any law , and is constantly reinforced in that belief by Europe .
<en> One day the European Union will have cause to regret its stance .

<en> The next item is the vote on two reports by Mrs Gräßle :
<en> 1. on a standard financial regulation for the executive agencies to be entrusted with the management of Community programmes
<en> 2. on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission thanks Parliament , and , in particular , the rapporteur , for his constructive approach .
<en> The Commission is entirely committed to providing for full transparency vis-à-vis the budgetary authority as requested today by Parliament and in line with the joint statements of the European Parliament and the Council of July 2007 .
<en> In particular , as regards the decentralised agencies , the Commission will insert in the regulation accrued information requirements concerning the number of contract staff , operating surpluses , assigned revenue , transfers and waivers to recoveries .
<en> More transparency of information on the work of the agencies , and not only in financial and budgetary matters , is also a concern recently expressed by the Commission in a communication to Parliament and the Council .
<en> At this point , let me recall the Commission 's proposal to set up an interinstitutional group to engage in a political discussion on the role and place of agencies in European governance , both with the Parliament and with the Council .
<en> The Commission is indeed convinced that , if we have a consistent approach to agencies , we - all three institutions - can promote the transparency and effectiveness of an important part of the European Union 's architecture .
<en> This is why I would like to conclude by expressing the wish that the interinstitutional working group proposed by the Commission starts its work soon .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for the opportunity to speak here even at this late hour , and thank you all for your understanding .
<en> I requested permission to speak here .
<en> I am speaking for the Commissioner 's sole benefit , as I think it is important to tell the Commission that we consider the amendments we have tabled , on which we shall also be voting tomorrow with a very large majority , to be important .
<en> I wish to tell him that we are only at the consultation stage with this dossier , and I should like to assure him on behalf of the whole Parliament that our amendments will help to bring greater order into the agency system .
<en> It is therefore very important to us all across the group divide that the Commission take them on board .
<en> I am obliged to the Commissioner for his assurances in this regard , and I shall also be monitoring the situation .
<en> It is very important to me that he also understand why we want this .
<en> We need better accountability in the agencies and greater transparency , particularly among staff members .
<en> This concerns our budgetary law most directly .
<en> The Commissioner will also be aware , of course , that if our wishes are not taken on board we shall find our own ways to fulfil them .
<en> We regard this essential to our budgetary law .
<en> The Commission had originally intended the present reform of the Financial Regulation to consist of merely technical modifications .
<en> We talk of better regulation , yet I have noted with great sorrow that the latest joint decision on agencies by the Council and Parliament in July has not been incorporated .
<en> The Commission 's draft came somewhat earlier , but it would have been nice , of course , if it had been subsequently reworked .
<en> I should have also thought this fairer than leaving the work to us .
<en> The European Parliament has introduced political changes with great unanimity right across the group divide .
<en> We want to bring internal operations , responsibilities , transfers of appropriations and accountability of agencies more into line with the operations and practice of the Commission Directorate-General by means of a declaration of assurance .
<en> We also want a better overview of the personnel and financial costs of the agencies .
<en> We want to be informed of all employees and not just those on the establishment plan .
<en> This is an absolute necessity .
<en> I should like to give an example from a recent report by a decentralised agency on financial management in 2007 .
<en> Thirty-nine posts are listed on this establishment plan , whereas 43 temporary staff and 11 contract staff appear in the text two pages before this .
<en> No two figures match , therefore .
<en> It is left to the reader 's imagination as to whether we now have 39 plus 11 posts or 43 plus 11 plus 39 , or whether the 39 posts of 43 staff are listed and the 11 are then added .
<en> We just do not know .
<en> I shall clarify the issue , but clarifying this issue for the large number of agencies is no fun , of course , and reporting and the reporting system are more or less equally chaotic in all the agencies .
<en> The agency I have just quoted , ENISA , is interchangeable with any other , and I should indeed like to ask why the information we are given is so full of inconsistencies .
<en> We also want more information on the agencies ' revenue - which , thinking of Alicante , can indeed be sizeable - and we want to know what is happening to this revenue .
<en> I thank the Commissioner in advance for taking on board these amendments - as he has just announced his intention to do .
<en> Currently , we have 29 decentralised agencies with 3 914 employees on the establishment plan for 2007 , with a budget of EUR 1.1 billion , EUR 559 million of which comes from the EU .
<en> The five executive agencies have 176 posts .
<en> The latest Commission communication on agencies was a very interesting one .
<en> The offer of a joint working group is very important .
<en> All three institutions must undertake to think through with each other the issue of the agencies ' future and area of work .
<en> In Germany , the issue of agencies and the growth of agencies is in the public eye .
<en> The media resonance is always great .
<en> The reputation of the European Union is also at stake if we do not succeed in conveying to the outside world why we actually need these agencies and what role they play in the European Union .
<en> We should also be pleased if the Commission could prove why programme management is more efficient and better value when done by the executive agencies than by the Directorates-General .
<en> This is a request that those of us concerned with the budget have already put forward on a number of occasions , but has still not been backed up thus far in writing by the relevant facts and figures .
<en> Parliament 's amendments serve to maintain an overview of the European agencies , and our urgent request to the Commission is to help us to bring more order into the agency landscape .
<en> As the Commissioner should know , we in Parliament trust the Commission on this issue .
<en> We know that this institution is our last resort , as it were , when it comes to creating order and transparency and providing a better overview in this regard .
<en> I should like to thank my fellow Members from the other groups , and particularly Mrs Haug , the rapporteur on agencies from the Committee on Budgets , and the two rapporteurs Mr Mulder and Mrs Herczog from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their suggestions , all of which we have taken on board .
<en> I therefore believe that we have put forward the proposed and desired amendments by Parliament that are most pressing at the present time .
<en> I beg the Commissioner also to incorporate these amendments in the corresponding draft .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would also like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Grässle , for her important work within the framework of these reports , which enhance the plans for a financial regulation for executive agencies .
<en> At a time when the European Parliament is set to see its prerogatives strongly reinforced within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon , I think it is particularly important to remember what our institution 's competences are , obviously as co-decider of the budget .
<en> This Parliament , elected by direct universal suffrage by the citizens of the EU , must be able to do more and better to control the proper use of Community funds spent , this time by the executive agencies .
<en> I would like very briefly to highlight four points in this report , which seem essential to me if Parliament is to be able to play its role fully and make it as easy as possible for citizens to understand our institutions .
<en> Firstly , I would also like to emphasise the need for better control over the use of assigned revenue .
<en> It seems important for the director of the agency to tell us about any transfers between titles exceeding the 10 % threshold .
<en> Secondly I should also highlight the importance of the figures for the establishment plan , as our fellow Member has just mentioned , whether for temporary staff , contract workers , seconded national experts , etc . , so that we as the budgetary authority have a clear picture of the development of the human resources budgets of the agencies .
<en> Thirdly , I think it is quite natural that we should be asking for a summary of the development of the agencies ' budgets to be sent to the European Parliament each year , in accordance with the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors .
<en> Fourthly and finally , the provisions in the report concerning the harmonisation of the deadlines for the discharge procedure should also give Parliament real control of the proper execution of the budget .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , I would like to take my turn at complimenting Mrs Grässle on the excellent work she has done , and obviously the Commission for this development concerning the agencies .
<en> I would like to highlight the very important provisions on the internal auditing of our agencies and suggest , following on from the comment by my fellow Member a moment ago , that we could work towards a consolidation , a sort of sub-consolidation in the EU 's accounts for all agencies , so that third parties and particularly MEPs , have a picture of the development of the accounting mass represented by all the agencies of the European Union .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I thank you for your extremely comprehensive answer .
<en> Are you encouraging or pushing Member States to use best practice or examples of best practice from one country to another to try and limit the amount of long-term unemployment among young people ?
<en> I am sure that some countries are , shall we say , more successful than others , and I was wondering whether there were ways in which countries could link up with each other to learn from examples of how it is done in other countries .
<en> In the past I have criticised answers to questions , and I just want to compliment you on your very comprehensive answer .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Mr Ryan , the exchange of information and good practice is one of the enormous assets of the European Union .
<en> It is a permanent part of the open method of coordination and a permanent part of our work , and I would like to stress that the Slovenian Presidency , for example , dedicated one of its presidency conferences to the issue of youth employment .
<en> This is a typical and ideal opportunity to compare the various approaches of individual Member States .
<en> You are right : some Member States are quicker and more efficient in finding solutions for some questions than others .
<en> Consequently , the constant exchange and comparison of experiences and practical knowledge are very efficient methods of achieving progress .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) New skills , the Internet , technology and the like are certainly very important on the job market .
<en> We have all learnt , however , that even in youth unemployment , it is frequently the lack of key skills - reading , writing and arithmetic - that is the real reason why young people cannot enter the job market for the first time and in early life .
<en> Are there any specific focal points in this area ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , Commissioner , you spoke about youth unemployment and , in the previous question , about the under-employment of women .
<en> Does the Commission intend to put forward proposals combining family and professional life and , in particular , with regard to maternity and parental leave ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Allow me to return briefly to what I said at the start .
<en> At present , the Commission is concentrating , in particular through the work done by my colleague Commissioner Figeľ , on the early drop-out rates and the acquisition of basic skills .
<en> You are right : it is vital that people acquire the basic skills and the ability to learn in early childhood and adolescence because it makes it easier for them to pursue their careers with more ease and success later on in life .
<en> Under our programmes , such as those financed by the European Social Fund , we concentrate on something that I would call a ' second chance ' , in other words giving children who have had problems ( and there are quite a few of them ) the opportunity to go back to the formal structures and complete their education .
<en> This is one of the Commission 's focal points because , as already mentioned , it is a crucial matter .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , in the debate on the Lisbon Treaty in Germany , some left-wing groups are alleging , and invoking the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in support of their allegation , that the Treaty would reintroduce the death penalty , so that - as they claim - people could be executed for the purpose of quelling an uprising .
<en> This is essentially an outrageous slur on the EHRC , which represents the inalienable core of the European value system and hence the symbol of a Europe which is committed to peace , freedom and the rule of law .
<en> I am appalled that people are being exposed to this kind of scaremongering about the EHRC , to which the EU is to accede under the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> I also protest vehemently against the statements made by some adherents of the Left equating the Reform Treaty with Hitler 's Enabling Act of 1933 .
<en> These are not only utterly absurd ; they also amount to a monstrous trivialisation of German fascism .
<en> That goes beyond the bounds of decency and morality .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , Britain is one of seven countries proposing legislation to adopt a Council framework decision for common rules on the enforcement of legal decisions rendered in absentia .
<en> It will mean that a British citizen can be tried , convicted and sentenced in a foreign country without their presence in a court of law , and then removed to that country for imprisonment .
<en> They will find themselves in a position not of defending themselves in a trial , but of proving themselves innocent after a conviction .
<en> Whilst there is a provision for retrials , not all EU Member States recognise retrials under their legal systems .
<en> This will further destroy the principle of habeas corpus and the freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment traditionally enjoyed by British citizens and fundamental to English law and freedoms .
<en> Everything that was good about Britain is gradually being destroyed by membership of this malignant organisation known as the European Union .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , the actions of Bulgarian authorities over the past several weeks clearly indicate once again that they have no intention nor any will whatsoever to deal with the main problem our country faces : to reform the judicial system and home affairs .
<en> Instead of protecting the lives and rights of citizens , the president , the prime minister , the prosecurot 's office , the Ministry of Interior and the Sofia mayor have merged into a symbiotic entity and are using the levers of power solely for political recketeering of those who disagree with them .
<en> What is worse , most of the media in Bulgaria , which ought to be the staunchest safeguards ensuring the irreversibility of the democratic path of development of our country , have entered into a bond , through financial interest , with the criminal element , and with the powers that be , and have become their vehement protectors and accomplices .
<en> Anyone who disagrees with the official line has their voice muffled and is deprived of access to the public stage .
<en> Unfortunately , all our efforts to raise these issues and discuss them in Bulgaria have met with vehement resistance by the corrupt authorities , which is why we have been forced to seek the involvement of the European Court of Justice in order to save statehood in our country .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I should like to say something about the very critical and deeply worrying situation in Lebanon .
<en> In Parliament we have been watching the situation and have on many occasions debated the consequences of a prolonged crisis caused by the breakdown in the operation of institutions , the inability to elect a President of the Republic , the economic impasse resulting from occupation of the commercial and administrative centre , and fear of terrorist attacks .
<en> This situation has culminated in all kinds of violence at the hands of Hezbollah because of the government 's decision to ban the former 's uncontrolled telecommunications network from operating .
<en> Mr President , let me remind you that a delicate national consultation is under way in Qatar .
<en> We must try however we can to encourage this national dialogue , which needs to be conducted with due regard to the general interests of the citizens of Lebanon and their desire for prosperity , security and national independence .
<en> Let us take advantage of all the opportunities offered to us by our Association Agreement with the country .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would invite you to join with me , on behalf of the European Parliament , in sending good wishes for success to all the troops from the European Union Member States serving in Chad .
<en> That high-risk EU mission , sanctioned by the United Nations , will have 4 000 Member State troops on the ground , seeking to protect and assist the 430 000 refugees and internally displaced people currently living in 42 camps .
<en> It includes many hundreds of Irish troops who are following in the proud tradition of the Irish army 's peacekeeping and humanitarian role .
<en> This mission is an example of what we in Europe can do now , and indeed an indication of what we could do even more effectively and in a more timely fashion as soon as we can implement the humanitarian aid , the Petersberg tasks and the common foreign and defence policy provisions of the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> I would urge you , Mr President , to convey our good wishes to the troops on the ground .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Aside from the criticism of certain aspects included in this proposal for a regulation , its contents should not be assessed without taking into account its ' role ' in the increasing liberalisation of international road haulage and passenger transport as promoted by the European Commission and by the European Union institutions with codecision power , namely the European Parliament and the Council .
<en> As a matter of fact , this central idea is highlighted by the European Commission itself in its proposal : ' Directive 96 / 26 / EC on admission to the occupation of road transport operator , the four Regulations on access to the road transport market , together with the deregulation of international transport prices which took place a few years earlier , shaped the internal market in road transport ' .
<en> In other words , ' common requirements for admission to the occupation ' were laid down while ' the opening-up of the market as a result of the Regulations has made for greater competition ' .
<en> As we highlighted with regard to the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market , this proposal aims to increase the liberalisation of international road transport by seeking to promote greater competition between operators in a sector that is already overwhelmed with countless heavy costs for its workers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) Harmonisation of the existing rules in this field is important as a means of optimising road transport in Europe .
<en> Moreover , a regulation is more expedient than a directive in this context .
<en> The rules governing the occupation of a road transport operator must fulfil precisely defined criteria if we are to achieve the highest possible level of safety on our roads .
<en> These rules must encompass both requirements and sanctions .
<en> A key element is the monitoring and checking of data , which must be carried out with due respect for personal privacy .
<en> It is very important that the national electronic registers containing the data should be interconnected so that data can be compared and the regulation therefore serves its intended purpose .
<en> I am opposed to Amendments 7 and 102 which seek to water down the six-day rule .
<en> A reintroduction of the 12-day rule , which has already been rejected , would be inconsistent with the substance of this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Mrs Ţicău 's report is part of a package of measures that , together with two other reports , aims to regulate road transport activity .
<en> This activity is supremely important within the European Economic Area as it enables the open and competitive market of which we are nowadays so proud .
<en> Under this new proposal , companies must hire a transport manager with certified training who shall be responsible for managing the company 's transport activity .
<en> The conditions already laid down for accessing the occupation - namely good repute , financial standing and professional competence - are maintained .
<en> This recasting is intended to make the existing legislation more intelligible and demanding in terms of safety and efficiency in this type of business .
<en> I therefore welcome the work carried out by the rapporteur to increase responsibility in terms of safety and guarantees of commitment in this sector and also the measures on professional competence which involve high-quality training and mutual recognition of diplomas and licences .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted for the report by my esteemed colleague , Mathieu Grosch , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international road haulage market which aims to merge the texts regulating access to the international road and cabotage transport market , currently governed by previous regulations and directives .
<en> Within the internal market , international transport between the Member States has been fully liberalised , although a number of restrictions still remain for cabotage .
<en> I welcome these indications and simplifications , and also the stepping up of penalties for infringements committed in Member States other than that of establishment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) This is just another step towards and another instrument aimed at increasing the liberalisation of international road haulage by seeking to promote greater competition between operators in a sector that is already overwhelmed with countless heavy costs for its workers .
<en> One of the current aims is to find a way of facilitating the inclusion of ' cabotage ' operations by road transport - in other words , carrying out up to three transport operations following an international journey , provided that these are carried out within seven days - in a market which is already so liberalised that this will profoundly impact on the finances and survival of national operators .
<en> This decision will also have harmful consequences for road haulage workers .
<en> This can be seen , for example , in the proposal by a majority of this House to remove the reference to ' working time ' , just leaving the terms ' driving time ' and ' rest periods ' , in other words allowing longer working hours which will adversely affect working conditions and worker safety .
<en> If we take account of the recent Court of Justice decisions , not even the reference to Directive 96 / 71 / EC on the secondment of workers will protect the labour rights of many workers in this sector .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - EU-US relations in many issues have been through substantial changes over the last years and are moving into a phase of consolidation for many items of cooperation .
<en> The recent case of the negotiations on lifting visa restrictions for travellers from the EU is an excellent example - in spite of the positive outcome - showing why , in order to ensure successful talks between the US and the EU , we ought to avoid mere bilateral agreements which actually undermine the negotiating powers of the EU as a whole .
<en> Having a package agreement encompassing the 27 Member States , based on the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States , was indeed crucial in order to support the EU visa common policy .
<en> It is essential to ensure that , where Community competences apply , we secure EU-wide deals with our strategic partners such as the United States .
<en> In my opinion , it is in the interest of both partners .
<en> It is indeed the only way to ensure that the Visa Waiver Programme brings full reciprocal visa free travel and equal treatment for all our citizens as regards the status of their passports , just as for US citizens .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - It is the moment to stress with all clarity and responsibility that the EU-US partnership is not only a cornerstone of the credible and efficient EU foreign actions but that only close cooperation and coordination between both partners would enable them to play key roles in the globalising world and to be guarantors of stability and democracy .
<en> The European Union has no other partner in the world with whom to share the basic values of freedom , the rule of law and defence of human rights .
<en> It is high time to fully restore normal cooperation and mutual trust after the damage that has followed the Iraqi invasion .
<en> The latter has dramatically split the EU itself .
<en> Therefore , I strongly call on both partners to complete without delays the work of the Transatlantic Economic Council .
<en> Also a joint approach to the problems of climate change will substantially enhance the chances of solving these problems .
<en> The same applies for Iran .
<en> Both the USA and EU need to agree on a common strategy on Iran to efficiently stop preparations to develop nuclear weapons there .
<en> Finally , we need a stronger redefined EU-NATO partnership which will also improve our cooperation in Afghanistan .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to raise two issues that the EU needs to focus attention on at the summit .
<en> Global challenges mean that the West above all has to show consistency and a sense of responsibility .
<en> Firstly , the Union should have a constructive debate on America 's role in climate policy .
<en> The world has one and a half years to change course before Copenhagen .
<en> On the one hand , we have to encourage the United States to make essential plans for legislation on climate .
<en> We need to stress that the solution to the problem of global climate change is a worldwide low-carbon economy .
<en> This means that the carbon market mechanisms of different countries should be made compatible and in the course of time integrated with one another .
<en> America 's regional emissions trading systems inspire hope .
<en> On the other hand , we need to recognise that our partner in the fight against climate change is better than its reputation .
<en> The EU should look for guidance from the United States and acknowledge its fruitful endeavours to develop clean technology .
<en> The Union has some way to go here .
<en> The United States is showing the way ahead by proposing to establish an international fund for environmentally friendly technology .
<en> Cooperation between the EU and the United States will also be very important in order to bring in measures to adapt to climate change .
<en> Secondly , the summit should highlight the basic values to which we are jointly committed : democracy , human rights and the rule of law .
<en> We have to venture to ask how our value base is implemented in the policies of the Western world .
<en> Do world leader 's actions look good in the light of day , for example , in the fight against terrorism ?
<en> Because terrorism is a threat the EU and the United States share , the means of countering it needs to stand up to scrutiny .
<en> Sometimes global political rhetoric and the everyday world seem to forget the fact that our value base does not place an obligation on others in the first place , but on ourselves , whether we are talking about the Middle East , the Western Balkans , or Africa .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The forthcoming EU-US summit will give both transatlantic partners a chance to find common ground on issues relevant to both sides of the Atlantic .
<en> Our continents share a common civilisation and a past .
<en> We have to ensure that the knot of this relationship is as strong as possible so we can achieve the goals that are not only important for both sides but are global necessities .
<en> The growing and extreme need for energy by emerging economies , rising food prices , and conflicts around the world are just some of the issues that the EU-US partnership has to work on together for peace , sustainability , and to facilitate human dignity around the globe .
<en> One of the success stories of this relationship is NATO , an organisation we should all support and strengthen as it has secured peace in Europe and developed deeper ties between the EU and the US .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , if we fish out the sea off the coast of Mauritania , that causes the very poorest people to come to Europe as immigrants , because they can no longer see any future at home .
<en> It is our poorest areas that have to deal with that , not the well-off areas .
<en> Then Europe loses the support of its voters , especially those on very low incomes .
<en> For that reason , too , cohesion policy is an absolute necessity .
<en> It is sad in very many ways , but also entirely understandable , that Ireland has rejected the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> The Lisbon Treaty is a real step forward for development policy .
<en> It is the first text to establish coherence properly .
<en> The Union should not take away from the poor countries with one hand what is given with the other .
<en> The policy of the Union on agriculture , fisheries , trade should not run counter to development policy .
<en> Certainly it relates to several policy areas , but this is not a question of rivalry between committees in this Parliament .
<en> That is an unimportant detail .
<en> The Treaty of Nice only required the Union to show itself a coherent force in the world .
<en> That turned out not to be enough .
<en> The agricultural policy shamelessly allowed our surpluses , such as sugar and grain , to be dumped on the world market with export subsidies .
<en> Fortunately those are now more or less a thing of the past .
<en> It is only in the Lisbon Treaty , though , that supporters of the poor countries can find a legal basis enabling them to safeguard solidarity with the poorest people in the world .
<en> Ireland nevertheless voted against it .
<en> It was mainly the people with the lowest incomes who said no , because the poorest in Europe do not identify enough with this European Union .
<en> Too much insecurity , too many risks for them , they have to put up with the consequences of this incoherent and anti-social policy .
<en> As the rapporteur , Mr Schmidt , has made crystal clear , the task is thus to show solidarity with all citizens of Europe and in the developing countries , whilst respecting the environment .
<en> That is no small task .
<en> There is a strong temptation to trade one of those solidarities against the other .
<en> All the same , they are not opposed .

<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) When EU countries exploit the natural resources of poorer countries , they leave large footprints behind them .
<en> Fisheries in West African waters are close to being exhausted , trade in illegal timber is destroying the environment , and the exploitation of other natural resources has proved to have huge consequences in a poor and politically unstable region .
<en> Our activities have effects on the local population .
<en> The report seeks more cohesion between the EU countries and wants the European Parliament to have more of a say .
<en> But many special interests are represented in this Parliament , which means that a European aid policy is bound to fail .
<en> The international work should be conducted by the United Nations and other organisations .
<en> If we really want to change the world as we say , we must resort to other measures .
<en> What the EU should do is to review and reform its own policy .
<en> The EU must cease to subsidise failed European agriculture , end the hidden protectionism which characterises its trade policy and abandon its immoral fisheries agreements .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , according to the resolutions passed by the European Union , most Member States concentrate their aid activities on subsaharan Africa , which also includes the states of West Africa .
<en> This region has the greatest development needs .
<en> Poland , too , supports the European Union 's standpoint as regards development policy and supports the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals in this region .
<en> There is growing support in Polish public opinion for aid to developing countries .
<en> Last year this stood at 77 % .
<en> At the same time we are aware of the need to increase the efforts made by individual Member States to fulfil their obligations and to increase the cohesiveness and effectiveness of European development policy .
<en> At present a very important issue , in view of the existing divisions here , is the preparation of a common standpoint of the European Union and of the Parliament for the conferences in Accra and Doha .
<en> Africa , as a region with the largest number of developing countries , has little experience of protecting its own biological resources .
<en> On the other hand , it is very important for Europe to have access to African mineral resources , and this is a policy that it is pursuing together with China and the Russian Federation .
<en> It is vital for European partners to improve their commercial attractiveness and to make development aid less dependent on democratic reforms in Africa .
<en> In particular , access to EU food markets is important to African nations .
<en> We should give them this access , before Brazil , the USA or Australia .
<en> What is needed is greater complementarity , cohesion and coordination in the aid programmes of the EU and of individual Member States .
<en> As regards the use of natural resources in West Africa , it is necessary to have an effective system for assessing the extent of this use , as well as better controls over it .
<en> I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for drawing attention to all these issues .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , according to the report , timber and fish are two of West Africa 's most important resources .
<en> As the EU is the main destination of these products , it is up to us to play a significant role in promoting their sustainable development .
<en> The EU is now considering granting Morocco advanced status , which allows for greater trade opportunities , a deeper political dialogue and cooperation on foreign policy and security matters .
<en> We are not opposed to this agreement in principle provided that Morocco agrees to end all human rights abuses in the illegally occupied territory of Western Sahara , that Morocco agrees to a free and fair referendum for the people of Western Sahara and that the fisheries partnership agreement is reviewed and the Saharawi population of Western Sahara are allowed to live as equal citizens of their Moroccan counterparts .
<en> There are many reasons why Morocco is not qualified to be given advanced status .
<en> In particular , by granting Morocco an advanced status the EU will certainly strengthen Morocco 's illegal occupation and make the political process towards a free and fair referendum more difficult .
<en> In addition , granting advanced status to Morocco would be going against the United Nations mission to organise a referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the discussion at this very late hour has clearly indicated the importance we all attach to this issue , so once again I thank Parliament for the report .
<en> As has rightly been pointed out , timber and fish are two key products for the economic and social development of West Africa .
<en> Let me emphasise strongly once again that ensuring that the exploitation of these natural resources is consistent with development goals must remain a priority for the European Union and for the countries of West Africa .
<en> As I explained in my initial presentation and would like to reiterate now , the Commission is committed to this objective , and the resolution Parliament is going to adopt tomorrow will be an important contribution to our work .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , the first thing I wish to do - and this may come as a surprise in the light of her intervention - is to express my thanks to Mrs Fraga Estévez , for we personally cooperated very constructively on the report and resolved numerous problems too .
<en> We should keep that separate from the institutional conflict which exists between the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development regarding the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The latter has something to do with the fact that , as a result of the ICEI study , we have been allocated the new task of performing coherence checks .
<en> The Council decided that measures in 12 policy areas were to be checked for consistency with development policy .
<en> These policy areas are always part of the remit of other committees .
<en> This naturally keeps causing institutional conflicts .
<en> It is a problem , but I would nevertheless like to thank you for our good personal cooperation on the substance of the report .
<en> Commissioner , I believe that the Commission has been on the right lines with the FLEGT process and with the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement since 2002 .
<en> That is a sound basis for further progress , and I would like to encourage you to proceed resolutely along that path towards the promotion of sustainable development .
<en> There is still a lot to be done here .
<en> This sound approach must be further developed .
<en> In so doing , you can surely rely on the support of this Parliament .
<en> Let me say one final word on the link between migration and overfishing .
<en> I need hardly say that it is not the sole cause of migration , for which there are many reasons .
<en> There are , however , clear indications that overfishing does play a part .
<en> And the European Union , among others , is involved in that overfishing .
<en> The International Organization for Migration has just provided very tangible evidence of this link in relation to Senegal .
<en> To that extent the President of Senegal would be very ill-advised to close his eyes to the reality within his country and off its shores .
<en> We should examine these matters more critically and address and resolve these problems together .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , to be brief , there has been a real decline in investment in the electricity market , particularly in cross-border grids , in recent years .
<en> A new legislative package is now needed , therefore , and Commissioner Piebalgs knows as well as my fellow Members how important the level playing field is to me .
<en> Splitting ownership is the best option , then .
<en> Fortunately , the Energy Council has realised that this level playing field does not exist at present .
<en> The ban on takeovers by horizontal non-split undertakings in the coming years is justified , therefore ; there is to be no cherry-picking of smaller-sized vital undertakings by non-split organisations .
<en> This gives organisations in the Netherlands , producers such as Nuon and Essent , the opportunity to develop a European outlook .
<en> It creates breathing space for the coming period .
<en> From this point of view , I wholeheartedly support the splitting of ownership now being proposed in Mrs Morgan 's report .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and support her position on getting a fairer deal for consumers .
<en> Mrs Morgan has rightly indicated that this is best achieved through ownership unbundling and that means we need to reduce the concentration of power of large companies and allow better access for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> Better regulation of electricity and gas markets is critical to ensuring fair competition and better prices for consumers and I am deeply concerned that soaring energy prices are putting Europeans increasingly at risk of energy poverty , especially the elderly , who are the most vulnerable .
<en> Given the current conditions in energy security , we absolutely need a well-functioning gas and electricity market in Europe .
<en> Recently we have experienced problems with the supply of energy and this report rightly seeks to resolve some of these .
<en> I have received a number of letters from my constituents in support of Amendment 159 which would prohibit Member States from authorising the construction of new power stations that emit more than 350 g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt produced .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the regional integration of cross-border electricity markets must be seen not only in the light of what is being discussed today , but also in terms of creating a single European market for electricity .
<en> Furthermore , the range of energy issues in the European framework deserves a more comprehensive and forward looking approach .
<en> Hence the initiative we took on Parliament 's STOA Panel , drawing up energy scenarios for the coming decades , using 2030 as a base reference .
<en> Parliament and some parliamentary groups are divided on the question of unbundling energy transmission networks and energy companies .
<en> This is sometimes of more relevance to national situations than to political and strategic choices .
<en> However , I would like to be perfectly clear on this matter , ladies and gentlemen .
<en> Personally I am in favour of a clear unbundling between the networks / companies operating on the electricity grid and the company or body managing the grids .
<en> I believe that this is the most beneficial solution for consumers that guarantees the possibility of setting up a truly internal market for electricity , which should be one of our objectives as MEPs and European citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) European electricity and gas consumers have the right to a universal service , that is , the right to be supplied with a specified quality , at reasonable prices that are easily and clearly comparable and transparent .
<en> I welcome the fact that the report by my fellow Member , Mrs De Vits , on the proposal for a Charter on the Rights of Energy Consumers , is also included in the debate on the third energy package .
<en> At present , energy consumer rights are laid down in various EU documents , but are often not transposed into national legislation .
<en> I welcome the rapporteur 's effort to make consumer rights more transparent .
<en> Consumers must have freedom of choice and the possibility of changing their supplier free of charge .
<en> They must understand what they are paying for .
<en> I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating in her report my amendments in which I called on the Member States to provide financial support to consumer organisations in the area of consulting services .
<en> Consumer organisations do a great deal of work on behalf of energy consumers , especially vulnerable consumers .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , let me first endorse what the rapporteur , Mrs Morgan , has said about the need to protect the more vulnerable consumers in particular against rising fuel prices .
<en> I also agree on the need to combat energy poverty and vigorously promote investment in renewable energy sources .
<en> However , as for the major question of creating a single internal energy market , achieving this aim depends not only on mapping out and applying a single strategy , but also on awareness of the specific characteristics of each participant .
<en> Complete ownership unbundling is not an unconditional , essential precondition for investments in improving the network .
<en> The delays in modernisation may be due to a misguided energy policy that treats energy as a product to be distributed primarily with the aim of increasing profits rather than improving the system .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first let me thank Mr Liese , the rapporteur , for his helpful and considerate collaboration .
<2en> This gives me great hopes for the forthcoming energy package that we shall be producing here in this House and then in association with the Council , and all to be done in this legislative term .
<2en> The present compromise shows that Europe is now taking climate change seriously .
<2en> This compromise , which transcends national boundaries , is also an indication that internationally we are making progress when it comes not just to climate protection but to energy efficiency too .
<2en> I am particularly pleased that all aircraft above 5.7 tonnes are included in the measures and that certain aircraft , such as corporate jets , are not excluded .
<2en> The public would not have understood it if we had provided exemptions for privileged groups .
<2en> We have had many hearings in this House in recent weeks and months on the subject of climate change .
<2en> Every single expert has said that we need to halt the trend for emission levels and we need to do it in the coming decade .
<2en> With this compromise we have succeeded in stopping the trend in the aviation sector .
<2en> In 2012 we shall introduce an upper limit of 97 % in the allocation of certificates , which will be reduced to 95 % from 2013 .
<2en> This will halt the trend in this specific sector , where emission levels have been rising rapidly , increasing by 73 % between 1990 and 2003 .
<2en> We can then set about achieving a trend reversal .
<2en> Some of my fellow Members have already mentioned this : 85 % of the certificates will be allocated free of charge , while 15 % will be auctioned .
<2en> I would have preferred a more ambitious approach here .
<2en> However , this is a compromise that everyone can now live with and a compromise is better than going to third reading .
<2en> The revenue should be used to combat climate change and to fund adaptation measures .
<2en> This is explicitly stated in the directive .
<2en> I would once more call on Member States to actually employ the money for this purpose and not to use it for plugging holes in some budget or other .
<2en> These revenues must be allocated appropriately , otherwise they will be perceived as an additional tax .
<2en> I particularly welcome the fact that the directive is to be reviewed in 2014 , which will allow us to establish whether we need to make readjustments somewhere or can adopt a more ambitious approach .
<2en> During the legislative process for NOx emissions I supported the introduction of a multiplier system .
<2en> That is now my question to the Commissioner : when will the Commission be presenting a legislative proposal in this regard ?
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I am surprised , pleased and concerned all at the same time .
<2en> My surprise is at the speed at which Parliament 's rapporteur , in a back-room meeting with the Council Presidency , managed to sweep practically everything from the table that Parliament has considered to be of importance to this dossier over the last two years .
<2en> This should not be the benchmark for our debate of the energy package that is before us , for that is back-room politics not transparent democracy .
<2en> However , I am pleased that we have kept our feet on the ground .
<2en> In our inclusion of the airlines it is especially important to keep the cost of the system down , for any airline today that does not operate an efficient fuel management regime pays for it with their own demise .
<2en> Finally , I am concerned at the wishful thinking that seems to be affecting many of us as regards the international situation .
<2en> Mr Liese , emissions trading in the US was not rejected by the President but was defeated in the Senate , in which the party that holds the majority could well be providing the President the next time round .
<2en> We really need to be realistic in our assessment of the situation , for even if we succeed in convincing the Americans to join in the emissions trading system we shall still be faced with a list of other countries around the world and I personally am not sure how we are ever going to start talking to them .
<2en> I am thinking for example of the Emir of Dubai .
<2en> In commercial terms this region is for us a much greater challenge and the competition from that particular source is much more significant than that which comes from a couple of - if you will forgive the word - bankrupt US airlines .
<2en> This is something that we have completely ignored .
<2en> It is very important to keep a sense of proportion , a sense of perspective when debating that we should certainly move ahead but not make so much progress that the others can no longer keep up with us .
<2en> We are provoking a trade war here .
<2en> This is something , Mr Liese , that you must have been made aware of one-to-one during your hearings in the US Congress , though funnily enough you will never say that openly here .
<2en> For this reason we now have a compromise that is fairly realistic but , it is to be hoped , in terms of procedure is not ...
<2en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( LV ) Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I would like to start by thanking Mr Liese , the rapporteur , for his good cooperation with the Council in order to achieve this fine compromise .
<en> I will mention only two points .
<en> One is , of course , an achievement - the fact that from 2012 quota trading will begin throughout the sector , and also in the three state companies that operate flights within the European Union .
<en> Secondly , though , I would like to emphasise the special 3 % quota that offers additional opportunities to young and very quickly growing EU companies , with an average growth of more than 18 % in four years .
<en> I think this will give them the opportunity to compete on those markets and at the same time it will also establish a quota ceiling of one million for such companies .
<en> This is therefore an excellent achievement , and an excellent compromise .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Liese for his excellent work on this file .
<en> I am only sorry that despite his best efforts the agreement we have before us today is one that my group can support only very reluctantly .
<en> That is a direct result of the deeply disappointing lack of ambition shown by the Council .
<en> For years now , governments have been talking with such enthusiasm about the ETS as the great answer to ensuring that aviation makes a real contribution to emissions reductions .
<en> Trading does indeed have the potential to play a useful role , but everything depends on the design of the scheme .
<en> Because of the Council 's intransigence the agreement we have today is a far cry from what is really needed and represents starkly the enormous gap between our governments ' rhetoric on climate change and the degree of political will that they are actually willing to muster .
<en> This agreement lacks crucial aspects , like a gateway to limit the degree to which aviation can just carry on business as usual by buying up emission permits from other sectors .
<en> It lacks full auctioning of emission permits despite the fact that it fulfils the Commission 's criterion of being able to fully pass on the costs , and it lacks a cap which is anywhere near as demanding as that required of other sectors .
<en> Now Parliament has done its best , and the agreement before us does at least represent some improvements on the common position .
<en> It is a small step in the right direction , but it is also a truly missed opportunity for what could have been .
<en> In order for it to become meaningful and for aviation emissions to be genuinely addressed we must now make sure the efforts are rapidly scaled up and given the environmental integrity they urgently need .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( SV ) Madam President , this summer may be the first without ice in the Arctic .
<en> Some of the world 's biggest glaciers are now sliding from the inland ice in Greenland out into the North Atlantic .
<en> Never before have so much ice and snow melted as over recent years .
<en> I saw it with my own eyes on a visit to Greenland last year .
<en> Everyone , including the experts on the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , are amazed at the melt which is taking place .
<en> This frightening development is of course directly linked to our emissions and to global warming .
<en> It is we in the rich world - the USA , Australia , Japan and of course the EU - who are to blame for this .
<en> That is why we must subject all sectors which contribute to emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases to a critical examination .
<en> The air transport industry has increased its emissions by around 100 % since 1990 .
<en> The air transport industry has got off lightly so far .
<en> Aviation fuel is exempt from tax , and local and regional authorities often subsidise airports in Europe .
<en> Here in the EU we fly as never before .
<en> The compromise on which we now have to decide unfortunately falls far short of the necessary action that we in the GUE / NGL Group wanted .
<en> The reduction targets for aviation should have been higher ; emissions other than CO2 should have been included ; emission rights should not be distributed free of charge .
<en> This is at all events an agreement which is a small step in the right direction .
<en> Aviation will be forced to reduce its emissions , and a small proportion of emission rights must be put out to auction .
<en> The auctioning process will also generate revenue , which will be used for climate measures in Europe and in the developing countries .
<en> Finally I would like to put a question to the Commission : can you give a pledge that countries which want to adopt parallel measures to reduce the emissions from aviation , such as the United Kingdom 's Air Passenger Duty , can continue to do so ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) I should like to state that the European Parliament 's resolution on Israel and Palestine is not quite appropriately timed in view of the latest developments , whereby Israel last week released another 198 Palestinian prisoners .
<en> This gesture gives evidence of Israel 's willingness to build mutual confidence in the peace process , despite a severely critical Israeli public .
<en> The same also applied to the recent exchange of prisoners on the Lebanese border .
<en> It is undoubtedly very sad that Israeli prisons are also holding Palestinian youths .
<en> The primary reason is , however , the fact that terrorist organisations are exploiting them , inciting hatred and a determination to kill .
<en> Over the last eight years , up to 16 % of suicide assassins and potential assassins have been minors and there has been a pronounced downward trend in age .
<en> Children 's upbringing and education are key factors which may have a significant effect on the future development of coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians .
<sp>
<en> - ( NL ) Mr President , with this resolution in particular , Parliament is showing that it does not take a neutral position on the highly complex conflict in the Middle East , that it is not a neutral player .
<en> Quite the contrary , this Parliament always systematically takes the side of the Palestinians against the Israelis .
<en> Evidently it is not enough for this Parliament that every year tens of millions of euro of European tax money disappears into the bottomless , corrupt and anti-Western pits of the Palestinian Territories .
<en> Evidently it is not enough for this Parliament that NGOs which openly - and I stress that - openly approve and explain away terrorist acts are sponsored again with millions of European taxpayers ' money .
<en> Now Parliament is asking for this literally in a resolution for the release of convicted terrorists .
<en> This position may well be politically correct ; I think we will live to regret it .
<sp>
<en> - ( NL ) Mr President , I also voted against the resolution on the Palestinian prisoners in Israel , because at the very least this resolution conveys the idea - and I will put this in a friendly way - that we as the European Parliament are not really serious when we condemn terrorism .
<en> The resolution argues for the release of people who have been involved in terrorist activities .
<en> At least one of them is responsible for the deaths of a number of Israeli citizens .
<en> Approving the resolution is not good for the credibility of Parliament , therefore , but much worse than that , it undermines the fight against terrorism in general .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , in the Flautre report I voted for Amendments 4 and 5 , which were not taken over and which concern Israel .
<en> I would like to explain my reasons : these amendments had nothing to do with sanctions against Israel ; rather they - and particularly Amendment 5 - referred to violations of international law perpetrated by Israel , which are widely documented .
<en> I would like to say that I am generally opposed to sanctions , whether they are imposed against the Palestinians or against Israel .
<en> What I regret , however , is that this amendment , which spoke of initiatives that could be taken with regard to Israel , as opposed to sanctions , was not retained .
<en> If we abandon the idea that we in the European Union need to take initiatives to prevent violations of human rights then we are failing our democratic system .
<en> I would also like to say that in putting forward this view we are not criticising the Jewish people , for we hold them dear and condemn all forms of anti-Semitism .
<en> We are not criticising the Israeli State , for we support its existence and want it to be secure , but we are opposed to those within Israel who are undermining democracy in that country , and that is something completely different .
<en> Moreover we support all the Israeli NGOs that are working to promote human rights and international law .
<sp>
<en> - ( NL ) Mr President , in the debate yesterday I already had the opportunity to mention briefly that the Flautre report on the human rights policy of the European Union really is quite a good and balanced document .
<en> However , what I regret is that there is no explicit reference in the report to the problem and the danger of Islamisation in Europe and in the world .
<en> That Islamisation is undeniable and puts a number of very fundamental European and Western values , fundamental rights and human rights at risk .
<en> I am thinking in the first place of the important separation of church and state and especially of the equality of men and women .
<en> The Islamic countries themselves also get off far too lightly in this report , even though in a number of those so-called developed countries and in a number of those often very rich countries , oil states like Saudi Arabia , situations prevail which are unacceptable , from actual slave trade and slave labour to exceptionally far-reaching and degrading discrimination against women .
<en> That should certainly be improved in a subsequent report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> With outrageous audacity , and without citing a shred of evidence even as a pretext , the political forces supporting and serving the EU have signed a joint resolution to condemn the Belarusian Government for the elections of 28 September .
<2en> The resolution proposed by the political forces of the European Left , through the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , is similar in spirit .
<2en> It is obvious that the EU and the parties of the ' European one-way street ' ( New Democracy ( ND ) , the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( PASOK ) , the Coalition of the Radical Left ( SYRIZA ) / Synaspismos and the Popular Orthodox Rally ( LAOS ) ) are aligning themselves with the representatives of imperialism who are rallying round the so-called opposition - the NATO lackey , Mr Milinkevich .
<2en> This opposition won a ' surprising ' 6 % in the previous presidential elections and failed to win a single seat in the recent parliamentary elections .
<2en> The election results should silence all the objections of EU and US imperialists , because the people of Belarus are supporting their government 's policy against NATO and the EU .
<2en> This is what is so infuriating and demoralising for the political forces of the ' European one-way street ' .
<2en> This time they do not have the pretext of released ' political prisoners ' , or the excuse of a lack of equal publicity for candidates .
<2en> Now that they acknowledge the existence of such equality , they are shamelessly and high-handedly claiming that the new parliament has ' doubtful democratic legitimacy ' .
<2en> The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn both of these unacceptable resolutions and express their solidarity with the people of Belarus in their struggle against imperialist dominance .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Recent elections held in Belarus can be described as anything but free and fair .
<en> Stalin 's notorious principle that it is not important who receives the votes , but who counts the votes , is still very much respected in Belarus .
<en> The votes were mostly counted out of the field of view of the observers , thus the OSCE election observation misson , for example , was compelled not to recognise the elections .
<en> Lukashenka 's hypocrisy in his recent courting of the West is unmistakable .
<en> He has made promises on the nature of the elections that he has been unable to keep - the rights of numerous election observers were violated by depriving them of their right to oversee the election procedures fully .
<en> We should not disregard this severe breach from the ideals of democratic elections .
<en> No European Union sanctions should be lifted before an evident regime transition has commenced .
<sp>
<2en> The position of the Council and of the Commission and the resolution of the European Parliament on the situation in Belarus have the objective of evaluating the results of the parliamentary elections held on 28 September , and also their impact on EU relations with Belarus .
<2en> The European Union finds itself in a complicated international situation .
<2en> On the one hand , there is no doubt that Belarus has failed to fulfil its democratic obligations , but on the other we are seeing a gradual , albeit slow , ' melting ' of authoritarianism .
<2en> During the elections it was possible to observe certain positive phenomena pointing towards democratisation , such as the liberation of political prisoners , the request for independent OSCE observers and an improvement in election observation conditions .
<2en> The Belarusian authorities did not , however , meet all their obligations .
<2en> They should confirm their desire to improve cooperation with the EU and create better conditions for dialogue with the EU .
<2en> They should take genuine action on a broader scale to move towards democracy , respect for human rights and the principle of the rule of law .
<2en> I fully support the call from the Commission and the Council to review and possibly suspend some of the restrictions that are in place with regard to Belarus .
<2en> The development of a civil society must not be blocked .
<2en> The sanctions imposed by the EU - especially those relating to visa procedures and the costs of obtaining a visa - hit ordinary citizens , not the state authorities .

<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , there is a tradition in European foreign policy that has been substantially shaped by Hans-Dietrich Genscher , who engaged in talks with the Soviet Union even during the most difficult times of the Cold War , but always on the basis of a sober analysis of Russian interests .
<en> At that time , defence of the status quo was the Soviet Union 's primary objective , while for Russia today the primary objective is to change the status quo to its own advantage .
<en> This is a totally different position in terms of Russia 's interests .
<en> It has an objective interest in frozen conflicts and in criticism of the Charter of Paris through recognition of Abkhasia and South Ossetia .
<en> This is where its interests lie .
<en> It is interested in an unstable Ukraine .
<en> None of this is good .
<en> This is a challenge for us .
<en> However , it is a lot better than the existential threat from the Soviet Union , and even at that time we engaged in talks with the Russians .
<en> Therefore , one thing is clear as far as we are concerned : we do not want Cold War rhetoric , but neither do we want naïvety .
<en> We want a critical dialogue with Moscow .
<en> We are in favour of the long-term goal of a strategic partnership , but not of the naïve assumption that we have already arrived at this goal .
<en> I would like to add that I would have been pleased if we could have had this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , Russia is an important global player and a permanent member of the Security Council .
<en> It has an enormous nuclear arsenal , extensive territory and abundant natural resources , including gas and oil .
<en> Its cooperation is essential in order to tackle challenges such as the Middle East peace process or the Iranian nuclear issue and to fight organised crime , terrorism , climate change and nuclear proliferation .
<en> I therefore believe that we must not isolate Russia , but rather try to establish dialogue and cooperation with her .
<en> We could also establish a relationship on another more ambitious level .
<en> The Russian Federation is a European neighbour which , having left behind a long period of political totalitarianism and economic centralism , has in the last decade started along the road of democracy , human rights and an economy of private initiative .
<en> If Russia continues to adhere to these ideals , its relationship with the European Union should be profound and one of true neighbours and partners based on common fundamental values .
<en> The crisis with Georgia was indeed very serious .
<en> For us , as members of the European Union , the basic principles must be non-use of force , respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states and compliance in good faith with international agreements .
<en> Russia 's behaviour in the summer was not in line with these principles .
<en> It also seems to me that the agreements of 12 August and 8 September have not been implemented in a totally satisfactory manner by Russia , which has perhaps taken advantage of ambiguities in those agreements .
<en> The Geneva Conference has also not started very well .
<en> If the Russian authorities want to build with us , the EU , a relationship of true cooperation and trust , their conduct should not remain the same as in recent months .
<en> They must also ensure adherence at home to the principle of respect for human rights and the rule of law which President Medvedev himself proclaimed at the start of his term of office .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , this is , in my opinion , a crucial moment .
<en> We must be vigilant and try to convince Russia that an intense relationship of mutual trust between true partners and European neighbours requires us to share basic principles and rules .

<en> ( BG ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of relations with Russia is one that has often come up in this House , which in itself shows how important this issue is , not just for the institutions , but also for the citizens of the European Union .
<en> I welcome your approach , Commissioner , because we have to live in the real world , and because we have to be fully aware of the risks and negative consequences of open confrontation with Russia .
<en> We need to try and learn from every conflict situation , by converting them into a strength for the future .
<en> We do not underestimate the gravity of the military campaign in Georgia .
<en> Prevention is the only policy that could avoid similar developments occurring in neighbouring countries .
<en> Two months ago I asked Mr Solana whether he expected Russia to be more compliant and more ready to compromise after the war in Georgia , or whether it would continue to act in a more confrontational and cavalier fashion .
<en> Of course , he did not reply , but today I can conclude that the negative scenario is not going to happen .
<en> However , this is also largely up to us .
<en> I believe that the challenge facing us is how to build new , pragmatic relations with Russia without compromising the values on which our Union is based .
<en> It is therefore important that we have a clear strategy to guarantee that every step towards cooperation on economic , energy and foreign policy issues and on tackling any challenges will be followed by a step towards promoting human rights and democratic reform in Russia .
<en> In conclusion , I would like to point out that it is important to bring to the fore the issues that can engage Russia in implementing the policies that we have in common - I will not list all these issues here .
<en> I believe that the approach demonstrated so far by the Commission and the Council will be maintained and be successful .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the European Parliament is the only EU institution that is elected directly by the citizens of the EU .
<en> It has also been called the conscience of Europe .
<en> This conscience has been burdened throughout the years with the conflicts provoked by Russia .
<en> Remember the war in Chechnya ; remember Ukraine ; trucks queuing up for weeks on Finnish , Estonian and Latvian borders ; the frozen conflict in Transnistria ; cyber attacks on Estonia ; a ban on Polish meat .
<en> On top of all that now comes Russia 's aggression against Georgia .
<en> I am worried that the EU is displaying only timid reactions , tiptoeing around instead of discussing sanctions .
<en> We are only encouraging Russia to engage in more irresponsible behaviour .
<en> I am convinced that a clear conscience in relation to Russia is not a luxury that the European Union cannot afford .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , next week they will start constructing a Formula 1 circuit in Moscow .
<en> When you construct a circuit , you have to stick to the engineer 's plan .
<en> There are no two ways about it .
<en> We are supposed to be the engineers of democracy in this House , and maybe we should talk , not really about the EU-Russia relationship but about the EU-Kremlin relationship , because the leaders of the Kremlin will change one day , and we hope that they will change for the better .
<en> Of course we want Russia in and we want the Kremlin in .
<en> Nobody can argue with that , but the question is : on whose terms ?
<en> It cannot be on their terms .
<en> It has to be on universal terms of universal values .
<en> We are supposed to defend the very foundation of the EU .
<en> If you are a member of the scouts , you have to be a law-abiding member of the scouts .
<en> If we condone these current - how should I say - practices of the Kremlin regime , we are in a way denying ourselves the raison d 'être of the EU .
<en> We are also betraying the Russian people , because we have to support democratic forces all over the world .
<en> No double measures .
<en> We have to give hope to those people who are fighting for the fundamental values in life .
<en> That is our duty .
<en> If Russia becomes democratic , we must welcome them to any international structure .
<en> We have to see far ahead , as our forefathers did .
<en> Why should Russia not one day belong to a reformed EU or NATO ?
<en> We will never know .
<en> Mr Monnet and Mr Schuman were very far-sighted people .
<en> That is the way forward .
<en> This discussion is becoming very serious , so may I remind you - when I think of our relationship - of just one Russian anecdote .

<en> in writing . - Being in the midst of the financial markets crises , it is easy for us policy makers to concentrate fully on the current problem and forget or disregard the aims and other initiatives of the European Union .
<en> Thus , I welcome this report which emphasises the real need for progress in clean and efficient vehicles .
<en> The most important aspect of this report , in my opinion , is that it not only concentrates on the vehicles themselves and consumer transport , but it also deals with supporting and encouraging the public sector .
<en> It is fitting for the public sector to show an example to the people of Europe in promoting clean vehicles .
<en> It is commendable that the rapporteur is seeking to establish a link between public procurement and fostering and promoting clean efficient vehicles , and I hope that this will lead to growth in investment and research of vehicles with low CO2 emissions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) This directive introduces a harmonised methodology for clean and energy-efficient vehicle procurement for a sustainable public transport service .
<en> It will also help to establish the priorities set out as part of the Lisbon strategy .
<en> The explicit requirement is for energy consumption , carbon dioxide and pollutant emissions to be taken into consideration when road transport vehicles are purchased by public authorities and by operators providing services as part of a contract with a public authority , as well as for purchases of road transport vehicles for providing public passenger transport services .
<en> The biggest economic benefit would be achieved by having to include external costs as award criteria in all procurement decisions .
<en> Vehicle owners would then benefit directly from the energy savings in the long run , which would far exceed the vehicle 's possibly higher price .
<en> Promoting clean , energy-efficient vehicles through public procurement for providing public transport services , boosted by this initiative , will accelerate the development of these technologies on the market and will contribute to energy savings , as well as to the protection of the environment and public health .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for the Jørgensen report promoting the use of green vehicles for public transport .
<en> The initial proposal submitted by the Commission in 2005 was rejected by Parliament as it involved a great deal of bureaucracy without , however , reducing the level of pollution .
<en> The old proposal 's demand was for 25 % of motor vehicles to be green .
<en> The new proposal only refers to motor vehicles intended for public transport and the public authorities responsible for providing these services .
<en> I believe that the new proposal will help instil greater awareness among local decision makers and make them take more robust action to protect the environment .
<en> At a European level , the costs resulting from road traffic congestion in large urban agglomerations are estimated at 1 % of Europe 's GDP .
<en> Pollution in large cities can also be reduced both through promoting public transport and , in particular , by having a clean public transport system .
<en> Apart from promoting metro systems , trams , trolleybuses and trains regionally or transport by ship , pollution can also be reduced in large European cities by introducing green buses .
<en> The new directive introduces the obligation on local authorities to calculate and take into account the cost of using a bus or minibus for its entire operational life .
<en> I would like to congratulate the local authorities in Prague for purchasing a fleet of green buses using state aid , thereby setting us an example to follow .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This directive deals with regulations on marketing authorisations for medicinal products .
<en> We welcome the EU 's initiative to simplify and harmonise the current regulations .
<en> This is a time- and money-saving matter which will satisfy both manufacturers and consumers in Ireland .
<en> The proposed revisions will be beneficial for the Irish pharmaceutical market which has a substantial presence in Europe .
<en> We are grateful that in this sector , 13 of the top 15 companies in the world currently operate in Ireland .
<en> There are currently over 140 med-tech companies in Ireland , which accommodate 26 000 jobs .
<en> Moreover , the annual export of medical devices amounts to approx EUR 6.2 billion , which is 10 % of Ireland 's total exports .
<en> We support the creation of single criteria for evaluation , approval and administration of pharmaceutical products that undergo changes such as manufacturing methods , product labelling or patient information brochures .
<en> We also recognise the need for further harmonisation of Member States ' national provisions and European regulations to reduce administrative burden and to simplify the system regulating changes , such as allowing a single application for one or more identical changes .
<en> We agree to the revision of the Commission 's control over ' listings of substances ' , ' withdrawal periods ' and ' principles and guidelines ' .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The current way of managing variations is proving increasingly inefficient and is no longer satisfactory either for the authorities or for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole .
<en> Any one change to products authorised under purely national procedures in different Member States is treated in a number of different ways in terms of the dossier to be submitted and the evaluation procedure .
<en> This situation causes problems in various areas : public health , the internal market , legal and practical applications .
<en> The report proposes certain improvements .
<en> For reasons of harmonisation and simplification , it is important that changes to marketing authorisations should be governed by the same regulatory requirements , whatever licensing procedure was initially used .
<en> This will bring benefits for all concerned : patients , authorities and pharmaceutical companies .
<en> I agree with the amendments proposed in the compromise position as they emphasise the need to simplify and reconcile administrative procedures , allow the possibility of submitting a single application for one or more identical changes and highlight the need to apply the subsidiarity principle .

<en> Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs , Mrs Berès and Mr Langen , for a very balanced report that studies the subject from the wide angle .
<en> Secondly , I think that when this report was initiated no one thought how timely it would be at this point .
<en> I think it is a sign of the EU 's ability to respond to global challenges , secure competitiveness and create stability .
<en> Without European Monetary Union , both the euro countries and the countries outside the euro would have been far more vulnerable to this financial crisis .
<en> Over the past 10 years , the European Central Bank has played a very positive role , and this initiative has ensured very stable monetary policy and economic policy that actually made us able to respond in timely fashion to the crisis and to take proactive actions , not only in the EU area , but globally when it comes to discussions of reform of global financial architecture .
<en> I think that this is more than a crisis of a financial nature : it is a crisis of decision-making and the rules of the game .
<en> What we need now is a firmer European role for supervision and for the European Central Bank .
<en> We need better harmonised regulation for all different financial instruments .
<en> We need transparency through proper procedures and , most of all , we need Europeans to be very persistent in unity to advance these policies globally .
<en> We have to be united because markets have grown beyond our national states ' capabilities , and we need coherent actions nationally , at European level and globally .

<en> - ( SK ) The euro will be the best investment stimulus for foreign investors in the region of Central Europe as well .
<en> Therefore , in connection with the introduction of the euro in Slovakia from 1 January 2009 , it will be up to the government of Robert Fico how to make the most of this opportunity .
<en> The sustainability of inflation and the deficit in the public finances will be very closely monitored in Slovakia and the current Slovak government must therefore continue with the reforms of the previous government of Mikuláš Dzurinda .
<en> If this is not the case , Slovakia may have a problem holding down inflation after entry to the Euro Zone .
<en> I believe that the Slovak government will take to heart the recommendations of the rapporteurs of the European Parliament and will not saddle the country with future debt .
<en> It should not meddle in pension reform in an attempt to obtain the funds of private savers and achieve a short-term improvement in the public finance deficit , it will not pass laws that conflict with the rules of the market and it will contribute to improvements in the entrepreneurial environment .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union derives its strength from its 490 million or so European citizens .
<en> The Euro Zone is a pillar of stability for Europe and the whole global economy .
<en> In the Euro Zone 16 million jobs have been created in the last 10 years alone .
<en> In the future , the Union will have to respond to the challenges posed by demographic and climate change .
<en> An ageing population will cause major problems of a social , economic and budgetary nature .
<en> I believe that the free movement of goods , people , capital and services needs to be defended , especially now against the backdrop of the financial crisis and economic recession .
<en> Lifting the barriers preventing the free movement of workers guarantees proper , decent working conditions for all European workers and provides an effective means of combating social dumping and tax evasion .
<en> I call on the European Commission and members of the Eurogroup to take the necessary measures , along with the governments of the Member States , to lift the restrictions imposed on Romanian and Bulgarian workers .
<en> The Euro Zone needs to set an example for the social market economy .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia and President Juncker for their work in developing this instrument , which is so important .
<en> The euro is a solid reality that has protected us in this crisis .
<en> Therefore we must press ahead and develop an economic policy to work alongside the monetary policy that has been so successful ; a policy for the Eurogroup as a whole , but potentially for the Union as well , precisely because at this juncture we need to undertake an emergency programme to address the forecasted economic difficulties .
<en> I therefore believe that a strong commitment is required ; we need to embark on a high-impact programme to build energy infrastructure in the Union and to make energy savings .
<en> I am convinced that we must do this as soon as we possibly can .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , allow me to make my points in bullet points .
<en> Homogenous markets are at the heart of the systemic failure that we have , and if really good operators like Mr Juncker and Mr Almunia cannot bring heterogeneity back to the markets , then we are only putting off failure to a future date .
<en> Homogenous markets are at the centre of this problem .
<en> Secondly , it was forecast in Ireland that the euro as a currency would be something like a vehicle with no brakes , no steering wheel and no lights .
<en> How much they got that wrong !
<en> Where would we be in Ireland today if the euro and the European Central Bank were not in place ?
<en> Why are we not taking greater credit for this ?
<en> This is one thing that could help us with the Lisbon ratification process .
<en> Lastly , concerning the argument about vaccination , parents have the right to decide , but if every parent decides not to vaccinate , then epidemics will rise .
<en> I would just say this : no man is an island .
<en> Britain may well be an island , but it is time that Britain revisited the question of joining the euro , because we cannot all go our separate ways .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , we find ourselves facing yet another eccentric proposal by the Commission ; with what is no more and no less than a bulldozer policy , it proposes to abolish all duty free shops at land borders between the Community and third countries .
<en> The big question is why ?
<en> Why , Commissioner , did you have this thought and , having had it , why did you not table it at the consultation which you organised in 2006 and why did you not include it in an impact assessment which you were obliged to carry out within the framework of the new principle of better regulation ?
<en> You must therefore explain to us why we should tell hundreds of workers that they will lose their jobs , especially in these difficult times ; you must explain to us what this impact is on the internal market which is so great that you need to abolish at one fell swoop all shops at land borders with third countries , which in the case of my country , in Greece , are working extremely successfully and with no fraud problems and no impact on the internal market .
<en> Parliament and the political groups which share this opinion must also take the political responsibility for explaining to the workers why it is that we want to abolish these successful shops .
<en> As far as I am concerned - as Mrs Lulling said quite clearly and as the IMCO said quite clearly in its report - we have not been given a convincing answer , which makes us believe that , for the Commission , this is something of a whim .
<en> We have not been given a convincing answer .
<en> I therefore make an eleventh-hour appeal for us to vote tomorrow in favour of Amendments 63 , 64 and 65 , so as to prevent this bulldozer policy from flattening once again everything that is working in the European Union .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , I shall make a specific proposal for the system of exemption of land-based shops .
<en> Commissioner , you are introducing a general exemption for land-based shops which constitutes discrimination against these undertakings and has an important impact on the functioning of these otherwise healthy shops , which make a significant contribution to national communities and local employment .
<en> In Member States such as Greece , with long land borders with third countries , these shops have been operating smoothly and profitably for a long time while , on the other hand , the question of systematic infringement of the criterion of purchase for personal use or cases of systematic abuse and tax evasion are clearly controlled by the national authorities .
<en> I consider that allowing duty free shops to continue to trade on land borders would be a solution which is also in keeping with the Commission 's own proposals , while controlling their modus operandi and stamping out cases of tax evasion would , as with all other shops , be the responsibility of the ports and airports .
<en> I therefore consider that , in the forthcoming vote , we should support Amendments 57 , 63 , 64 and 65 and , in the worst case scenario , Amendment 69 , which extends the period of operation of these shops to 2012 .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I welcome the report on general arrangements for excise duty .
<en> I wish to highlight the progress made in the matter of purchasing duty .
<en> The original proposal , if implemented , would have restricted passengers to purchasing duty-free goods only in the final airport of departure before leaving the EU .
<en> In practical terms this would have meant that if a person went on a journey from Cork in Ireland to Dubai via Paris they would only be able to purchase duty-free goods in Paris .
<en> This would have decimated the profitability of Irish regional airports , as many currently rely on commercial activities for the bulk of their income .
<en> This would undoubtedly have led to job losses .
<en> However , this has now been addressed and accordingly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on working to address our concerns .
<en> This represents a welcome development at a time when the Irish Government has introduced a new airport tax which will discriminate against beleaguered smaller regional airports to the advantage of the already congested Dublin airport .
<en> In that regard I call on the Commission to investigate the legality of this measure under EU competition rules .
<en> I welcome the report from Mrs Lulling and the Commission .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , perhaps if I were Mrs Lulling living in Luxembourg I might feel as strongly about not having indicative limits .
<en> Unfortunately , I live on an island where there is a lot of smuggling and much of the alcohol and tobacco which people think that they can use for their own particular purposes is in fact later sold on to other people through commercial resale .
<en> I am afraid that anything we do to end the indicative limits would send a signal and a message to those smugglers who look for the resale of alcohol and cigarettes .
<en> Indicative limits may not seem like a safe guide for consumers but they are a safe guide for children , children who often end up taking the alcohol and cigarettes sold by bootleggers and smugglers who bring them into my region in the South-East and sell them in the streets , on the back streets and on the estates , for small change , one or two cigarettes at a time perhaps , but enough to get kids started .
<en> It is this trade which needs to be controlled and can only be controlled by setting indicative limits so that we can get to the source of the people who are trying to do this and trying to smuggle it past our police and customs officers .
<en> That is why I believe that indicative limits should stay .
<en> It is not , as I say , an end to the integration of the single markets , but it certainly does bring about a better idea of social cohesion and social behaviour and , in the United Kingdom , the customs and excise officers and the police officers asked for this .
<en> They asked for it because it gives good guidance as to what people would be expected to bring back for their own personal use .
<en> Tobacco has a life of only six months , so when you stop vans packed to the ceiling with cigarettes , you have to ask the question : is that really for personal use or is it going elsewhere for resale , and often to children ?
<sp>
<en> - ( RO ) Fellow Members , excise duty and electronic charging systems in general appear to be technical matters , but they also serve certain powerful political objectives .
<en> However , to be able to use them , we need to take account of the specific situations in Member States , along with the abstract theories .
<en> At the same time , we need to maintain consistency with more general principles of the policies which we apply .
<en> For instance , the principle of equal treatment .
<en> This report would meet both conditions if a proposal is accepted .
<en> This applies in particular to Amendment 69 , which refers to maintaining duty-free shops at customs points in the Union other than at ports and airports , until 2017 .
<en> This amendment will eliminate the discrimination between those who travel by water or air and those who travel on land , which is totally unjustified not only from an economic and theoretical , but also a practical perspective .
<en> At the same time , it offers a certain advantage to those living in the border areas , as has been pointed out already .
<en> These people are generally economically disadvantaged due to their peripheral status , but if their jobs were to disappear , this would have a negative impact on them .
<en> Fellow Members , there are serious reasons for you to accept this amendment during tomorrow 's vote .
<en> Compared to the huge expense we are prepared to go to without any objections in order to save corporations , this exemption has only minor financial repercussions .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for Mrs Gräßle 's report because anyone involved in an investigation conducted by OLAF needs to have the opportunity to make comments , at least in writing , about the matters relating to it .
<en> These comments should be presented to the Member States involved , along with other information obtained during the course of the investigation .
<en> This is the only way to present national authorities with complete information relating to the case , while also respecting the principle according to which both parties need to enjoy the opportunity to present their own point of view .
<en> At the same time , the report also ensures cooperation with third countries and strengthens the role of the OLAF Control Committee .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted for the report by Mrs Gräßle on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office ( OLAF ) .
<en> It is , in fact , extremely important for us to amend the regulation on such investigations , since certain interinstitutional relations must be reviewed .
<en> In addition , we need to amend the regulation with regard to the rights of persons involved in investigations and with regard to the exchange of information between OLAF , European institutions , Member States and informants .
<en> Finally , I congratulate Mrs Gräßle on her initiative ; she has produced some further interesting proposals , concerning , for example , the new role of the Director General of the Office , who would have powers to open external investigations not only at the request of a Member State or the Commission but also at the request of the European Parliament .
<sp>
<2en> Thank you , Madam President .
<2en> I voted in favour .
<2en> The key point of this debate is not only the specific issue being tackled by the Committee on Petitions , with reference to the dissemination of German in relation to its use by Community institutions .
<2en> First and foremost , this is a general issue of access to documents by citizens of all nationalities , and , as a result , of the transparency of the Community institutions .
<2en> From this perspective , therefore , I believe it is absolutely vital for the Council to carry out a thorough examination of the issue with a view to promoting an increase in the number of languages used on Presidency websites .
<2en> Such an increase could take place gradually , on the basis of appropriate , objective criteria to be defined .
<2en> We should , however , bear in mind the fact that the greater the number of languages used , the greater the number of citizens that will be able to have a closer relationship to Europe .
<2en> Citizens should view the European institutions in the way in which they view the buildings that house us : our institutions ought to be accessible .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) We generally agree with the report and , in particular , with what it says about the Ombudsman 's conclusions in that : ' the Council 's refusal to address the substance of the complainant 's request constitutes an instance of maladministration ' and ' the information on these websites should , ideally , be made available in good time in all official languages of the Community ' .
<en> However , we disagree with paragraph 1 ( d ) of the report 's conclusions , which states : ' if the number of languages is to be limited , the choice of the languages to be used must be based on criteria of objectivity , reasonableness , transparency and manageability ' .
<en> We would argue that the Council 's website should , like those of the European Parliament and the European Commission , contain all its information in all the official languages of the European Union .
<en> Only in this way can the multilingualism and cultural diversity supposedly defended by Community leaders , but which in practice are constantly being called into question for the sake of economising , actually be defended .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Although there are some contradictory aspects in the resolution adopted by a majority of this House , with the odd positive aspect , the main argument is that , because of the ageing population and demographic change , greater fragility of the universal and public social security system is justified in order to respond to the interests of the private financial sector , which wants to manage the greatest possible slice of this cake .
<en> Just look , for example , at the following paragraph : ' Recalls that the trend towards individualisation , contributes to the modernisation of the second and the third pillars , without calling into question the first pillar of social security systems ; this to enable people , especially women and other vulnerable groups , to have more freedom of choice and thus become more independent and able to build up their own , additional pension rights ' .
<en> In other words , in the name of freedom , the aim is to encourage people to find alternative financial solutions to public social security , even where the clearly negative results of this are well-known .
<en> Recent cases in the US are a perfect example of this .
<en> However , capitalism always tries to use propaganda to further its own aims .
<en> This is why we have voted against .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I am speaking English for the first time in this plenary because I hope that the French Presidency will listen to me .
<en> Unfortunately , the present model for effort-sharing proposed by the Council would mean that the European Union would reduce emissions mainly outside the EU through CDM / JI .
<en> It would mean moving up to 70 % of the emission reductions elsewhere , mainly to developing countries .
<en> This would totally undermine the credibility of our climate policy .
<en> An absolute red line for Parliament is a 50 % limit for offsetting , which would ensure that the majority of our emissions reductions are domestic .
<en> This 50 % limit has always been a cornerstone of the EU climate policy , through the long years of the Kyoto negotiations .
<en> The high CDM quota proposed by the Council would mean a U-turn in EU climate policy .
<en> This would give too easy an argument for everybody who wants to diminish and blacken EU climate policy .
<en> The IPCC says that the industrialised countries should reduce domestic emissions by 25 to 40 % and developing countries by between 15 and 30 % compared to business as usual .
<en> We cannot double-count emission reductions .
<en> If we want to offset the majority of our emission reductions , then de facto we demand more from developing countries than from ourselves .
<en> It is very hard to see how this would help international negotiations and I really hope that the French Presidency understands this basic point of international climate policy .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , we have now said virtually everything about energy and climate change .
<en> We know that climate change is happening , but we also know that a much more significant global warming occurred in the past .
<en> We know that in the natural environment carbon emission occurs largely without human intervention .
<en> Human contribution to carbon emission is only around 4 % .
<en> The main source of CO2 is the ocean , which contains 50 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere .
<en> Individual countries do not emit equal quantities of carbon dioxide .
<en> Large quantities are emitted by developing countries , such as China and India .
<en> Without reducing their emissions , Europe alone will not be able to solve this problem .
<en> The problem will not be solved either by imposing restrictions on countries with significant carbon emission levels .
<en> Economies such as Poland 's will continue to rely on energy from coal and on biofuels for a long time to come .
<en> These sources will remain the main driving forces of their economies .
<en> The expected 20 % reduction of CO2 emissions by the year 2020 on the proposed terms will destroy those economies .
<en> The plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 80 % by the year 2050 would result in the collapse of the energy economy not only in Poland but also in many other countries , and would undoubtedly lead to a total economic disaster .
<en> We must therefore study the problem in greater depth and take protective action .
<en> Its solution will certainly not be advanced by bilateral talks between Russia and Germany , excluding other Member States .
<en> This is an issue which we must discuss together and find a common solution .
<en> I hope that the Poznań meeting , and the subsequent Copenhagen meeting , will result in an agreement and in a solution which will be beneficial to all .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , the discussions in Poznań , and in Copenhagen a year from now must succeed .
<en> There is no more room for wishful thinking and other delays .
<en> Just the day before yesterday , the European Parliament , with an outstanding majority , almost unanimously , voted in favour of the Florenz report , requesting ambitious goals , adequate funds and direct measures , but the corrupt alliance in the Council and the Commission is trying to slice through and undermine this effort .
<en> It is unacceptable for the Council to undermine the role of Parliament , just to please Mr Berlusconi and a few other new members of the European Union .
<en> The interests of European citizens and the historical interests of the European Union itself must come first .
<en> The European Union must continue to lead this effort and avoid undermining the European Parliament 's will to contribute .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the imposition of the drastic solutions contained in the energy and climate change package on European Union states which account for only 15 % of global carbon emissions will have a destructive impact not only on Poland , but also on Europe and the world .
<en> While the old EU states have reduced their carbon emissions by approximately 3 % , in Poland , as a result of industrial transformation and the modernisation process , emissions have been reduced by approximately 30 % .
<en> In spite of this , the European Union demands further reductions , which are supposed to represent implementation of solidarity and burden sharing , but which are certain to lead to the collapse of our industry and to a huge rise in costs .
<en> In addition , we oppose the CCS Directive recently imposed .
<en> This will make it impossible for Poland to use geothermal energy and to achieve the goal of a 20 % share of renewable energy .
<en> On the contrary , it could become the cause of an environmental disaster , rather than ensuring environmental protection .
<en> Releasing carbon dioxide from the earth 's strata can cause the death of living beings as well as tectonic movements and earthquakes .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Europe is warming up faster than the global average .
<en> Within one decade , as you are aware , the injuries caused by natural disasters have doubled to almost 14 billion annually .
<en> We must therefore consider our next steps carefully .
<en> This is precisely where we still have problems .
<en> If we now consider exemptions from emissions trading , it must not be forgotten that energy enterprises have shamelessly charged the consumer for their free certificates in order to generate additional profits for themselves .
<en> This must not be allowed to happen again .
<en> We do not need any more ill-considered hasty reactions like the green fuel fiasco either .
<en> Alleged zero emissions from electric cars are useless if the power comes from coal-fired power stations .
<en> In my view , however , it is quite ridiculous to extol nuclear energy as environmentally friendly in this situation .
<en> If the billions that go up in smoke for this on an annual basis were used for renewable energies , maybe we would not have any energy problems at all any more and we would certainly be a major step further forward in terms of CO2 reduction .
<en> Furthermore , in this connection it must be remembered that in the long term we must encourage the subsidising of public transport and the movement of goods by rail .

<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I refer to the relevant rule of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> A few months ago , we voted on the Bauer report , and afterwards I wrote seeking clarification of how we should be voting on amendments to reports .
<en> There is no doubt that we need a qualified majority in the final vote if we are to call on the Commission to take legislative action , but I fail to see why we also need a qualified majority beforehand for amendments .
<en> Unfortunately , I have yet to receive a reply .
<en> We have now had another such report on the agenda .
<en> I would be grateful if the services could clarify this .
<sp>
<en> Mr Caspary , I have just been informed that a reply regarding the Bauer report is on its way to you .
<en> I hope that it will reach you before Christmas .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The report by Mr Belder considers the current situation of the European Union 's trade and economic relations with this increasingly stable region , where many countries hold candidateship for EU membership .
<en> The role of the EU as a major partner for the area in maintaining trade and economic relations while pushing for a stable , lasting peace in the area is a very important one .
<en> The EU 's strength as an economic partner , but also as a model for a strong civil society , government and dynamic institutions , should be used to push for the development of the region .
<en> A threefold and differentiated approach , taking into account the relative differences between countries in the region as well as association agreements and further support , provides a clear way to address issues of underdevelopment and shore up intensive regional and international economic cooperation .
<en> As a means of cementing a lasting peace and promoting the ideals to which we are all committed , I support Mr Belder 's report .
<sp>
<2en> I know the Belder report only deals with the economic and commercial relationships with the Western Balkans and the evident need for the European Union to assist in their reconstruction , in the economic , legal , political and social fields .
<2en> I am surprised , though , that , despite the statement that this aid , as well as the accession processes , must be differentiated and adapted to each country , the report does not really take into account the specific situation of each country .
<2en> Serbia , for example , is not even mentioned .
<2en> Above all , this Parliament , always quick to condemn violations of human rights around the world or to demand ' human rights ' clauses in international cooperation agreements , has achieved the master stroke of voting for a report on the Balkans without once mentioning the dramatic and inadmissible situation of the Serb populations in Kosovo , who have become pariahs in the historical land of their fathers .
<2en> Meanwhile , it congratulates itself on the hundreds of millions of euros given to the authorities who provoke , organise or tolerate this situation .
<sp>
<2en> The consolidation of economic relations with the Western Balkans is of immense importance both to the EU and to the Western Balkans .
<2en> I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament is working intensively on this issue and that we adopted the Belder report today .
<2en> In light of the fact that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans lies with the EU , their economic and political rapprochement to the EU is very important .
<2en> In order to tie these countries to the EU in the long term , the development of their market economies and regional cooperation must be fostered .
<2en> That is why constructive and positive signals from the European Parliament are also important .
<2en> It is in the interests of the EU to champion the creation of political stability , legal security and hence good framework conditions in these countries for foreign investment .
<2en> The Belder report underlines the fact that the level of economic relations depends on progress in each individual country .
<2en> Moreover , it should be the EU 's objective to diversify the national economies of the countries of the Western Balkans .
<2en> All these important aspects are reflected in the report .
<2en> I am convinced that a positive development in economic relations between the EU and the Western Balkans will be of benefit to all countries on the continent of Europe and I await the implementation of our proposals with anticipation .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans .
<2en> I agree with my fellow Member in considering that the European Union has a vital part to play in the process of economic and political revival of countries in the Western Balkan area , with a view to their membership of the European Union , firstly in terms of stabilising the political situation and secondly in economic and trade terms .
<2en> I would nevertheless like to emphasise the need for the Union to conduct an in-depth analysis of the situation with regard to respect for human rights and democratic principles within each country .
<2en> I refer in particular to Croatia and the numerous Italian expatriates who continue to be clearly discriminated against in that country , despite Croatia 's official application for admission to the EU .
<2en> This aspect is , in my opinion , at odds with the situation of Serbia , a country that has only been granted the status of potential candidate and to which the Union should be more open than it has been until now .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report on trade and economic relations with the Western Balkans as the motion for a European Parliament resolution also includes the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and that of the Committee on Regional Development of which I am a member .
<2en> Economic growth and development in the Western Balkans region will provide the conditions for constructive partnerships with the EU 's eastern Member States , which ultimately includes Romania too .
<2en> At the same time , linking the economic and trade policies of the countries in the Western Balkans to the European Union 's policy will support the stabilisation and association agreements signed between the EU and these countries .
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because economic stability may also lead to political stability in this area , which has been particularly troubled over the years .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> - Mr President , we head now to Copenhagen , and my honourable friend 's excellent report is a good - if I dare say it - road map , or rail map , on how we should get there .
<en> Twenty per cent by 2020 was a start - but only a start .
<en> The package of climate measures that we have taken perhaps could have been better , but they were a start - they were a step forward .
<en> Now , with the changes in administration in the United States , we can no longer hide behind the United States ' refusal to cooperate .
<en> With the Obama presidency , we have the opportunity to stop exchanging words and start exchanging ideas .
<en> We hear that a meeting will take place on 6 March 2009 .
<en> The following week we are back here and I hope we will have a statement from the Council on the result of its meetings in Washington .
<en> With the United States , we can now move to that 30 % target and beyond .
<en> We are moving on now to ecodesign , realising here , as elsewhere , that it means tremendous new opportunities in innovation and jobs .
<en> We need to move on to shipping and to agricultural emissions .
<en> The Commissioner has referred to the urgent need to talk to the low-income countries in the developing world .
<en> They will be devastated , but they did not cause this problem .
<en> Islands will sink beneath the waves ; malaria , respiratory disease , skin cancer and eyesight problems are already happening .
<en> Devastation will come to agriculture .
<en> They must take action , but they need our help .
<en> Scientists , of course , can be wrong and so can politicians , as we saw with Mbeki and AIDS .
<en> I may be wrong about the possible flu pandemic .
<en> I may be wrong about the probable impact of global warming .
<en> However , the majority of scientists may be right ; the majority of politicians may be right .
<en> I and we will be culpable on both issues if I and we fail to take action to ensure that neither happens .
<sp>
<en> - ( FI ) Madam President , the initiative by the Social Democrats to set up the Temporary Committee on Climate Change in spring 2007 is now bearing fruit .
<en> The outcome of inter-group negotiations and discussions is an emerging , ambitious , long-term agenda for action to curb climate change .
<en> For this I would sincerely like to thank the rapporteur , Karl-Heinz Florenz , and the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups who have collaborated excellently on this .
<en> Many are sceptical about whether the Committee on Climate Change will bring added value to Parliament 's work .
<en> Today we can see the benefit of having Members of Parliament , who view matters from different perspectives , working and listening together to the world 's top experts .
<en> That leads to credible results , as we can see .
<en> I am also sure that the very existence of the Committee and its work separately contributed to the fact that the climate package was got through so smoothly and swiftly last December .
<en> I also strongly support the appeal made by Guido Sacconi , the Committee 's chairman , that the post-election Parliament should address this issue and ensure that there is the most robust approach here to issues concerning climate change .
<en> The mindset in the European Union has long been that we need action to prevent climate change .
<en> We have , however , lacked the financial instruments .
<en> The Climate Fund , which has now been proposed and for which money would be collected from the proceeds of emissions trading auctions , is an important initiative , and I wish it every success for the future .
<en> We need it to bring about change in our industrial structure and so that we can really get somewhere with this new green deal .
<sp>
<en> - ( SV ) This report promises a great deal .
<en> It contains virtually every issue that has been mentioned in the climate debate over the last two years or more .
<en> Nevertheless , I think this piece of work lacks the punch , drive and force that are actually needed to pursue the political line that we have initiated in Europe with regard to climate issues .
<en> No measures are proposed with regard to the protection of land and soil .
<en> As regards water resources , there is a whole package of proposals in the World Water Forum that could have been included .
<en> When it comes to energy efficiency , there are options that have not been included in areas where we have the opportunity for decision-making in Parliament .
<en> Alternative fuels are also treated with far too much restraint .
<en> In the very important area of health , the report focuses on the collection of facts and the control of mosquito bites , where , instead , we need major strategic decisions in Europe to cope with the effects of climate change on human health .
<en> There are options here , too .
<en> In this regard , we needed to come up with more with regard to growth and jobs .
<en> It is , of course , possible to create jobs in Europe .
<en> They are needed here .
<en> We need to anchor the measures in economic policy .
<en> In a few weeks ' time , the Council of Ministers will meet to discuss the funding of the decisions that are to be made in Copenhagen - extremely important decisions , which we in Parliament could have had a great deal of influence over .
<en> Without this anchoring in economic policy and in a policy for work and growth , there is a risk of this report becoming ' like a candle in the wind ' , a nice document , but one lacking the drive and decisiveness that we need when it comes to these issues .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Madam President , I feel as if I am at the inaugural conference of a newly-founded religion , a false religion , teeming with false prophets and ideas .
<en> The very political powers which are trying to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions , a move which has no scientific basis and comes at the price of restricted human development , are the ones responsible for this crisis .
<en> The blame for this situation lies with those who , along society 's path towards progress , aim to build a global government which includes the very bodies which will make an enormous profit from carbon trading whilst simultaneously brainwashing the little people with threats of climate change .
<en> We must create a basis for development in the field of energy .
<en> In order to survive and develop , mankind needs new , powerful sources of energy , and Europe needs balance and self-sufficiency in terms of its energy supplies .
<en> Do you not understand this ?
<en> If you create that which has been approved today , you reduce Europe 's chances of competing with the rest of the world .
<sp>
<en> - ( EL ) Madam President , the Florenz report backs up the evaluations made by scientists and , to a large extent , shares citizens ' concerns .
<en> It is a step ahead of the energy package approved by the Council in December , but we need to go beyond evaluations to specific measures , to regulations , to timetables , because climate change and its consequences are here and there is no time for further delay .
<en> We must be careful not to allow the issue of nuclear energy , which is irrelevant to this report , to get into the report through the back door with cunning amendments , which is what some governments are seeking .
<en> We must ensure that this report , without changes that alter its balance , convinces the Council and the Commission to go one step further and not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to undermine the efforts made so far .
<en> Economic crisis and environment policy can go hand in hand to give us a positive result both for the environment and in creating jobs .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , 14 years on from the Barcelona conference and the launch of the EuroMediterranean partnership , the balance seems entirely unsatisfactory .
<en> Shall we assess the results achieved thus far in relation to the financial commitments made ?
<en> I believe it is Parliament 's legitimate right and the Commission 's duty to do so .
<en> Shall we pretend not to know that civil rights are completely unprotected in that Euro-Afro-Asiatic region ?
<en> That equal opportunities are still lacking ?
<en> That respect for religious freedom is still a dream ?
<en> That economic and social growth are still marking time , while people trafficking grows at an alarming rate , increasing the flow of illegal immigrants , above all on the coast in my local area , in southern Italy , and Sicily ?
<en> Under these circumstances , rather than representing an opportunity , creating a free trade area will accentuate the divide between rich and poor regions .
<en> To conclude , Madam President , although we have doubts about paragraphs 29 and 36 , my group voted in favour of the report on the Barcelona process as an act of hope in the face of so much scepticism .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , the Eastern Partnership is a project of the utmost importance , which is why I am eager to see it become a priority in terms of European Union foreign policy .
<en> I would like to mention four aspects on which we should , in my opinion , focus our activities .
<en> Firstly , we need to promote democracy and human rights , as this will ensure greater political stability in those states and guarantee the protection of fundamental rights .
<en> Secondly , we need to focus on economic integration and opening up the free trade zone .
<en> This will afford all those concerned broader access to new markets , thus increasing the demand which is so vital during a crisis .
<en> Thirdly , we need to focus on ensuring security and stability in Europe .
<en> In this instance , I am referring solely to Europe 's energy security .
<en> In order to prevent another blockade of gas supplies to the EU and ward off the temptation of using monopolistic exporters , our primary requirement is greater diversity in terms of energy sources and transit networks .
<en> Fourthly , we need increased mobility and a cultural and educational exchange .
<en> These two areas of activity are interconnected and complement each other .
<en> They have an impact on the EU 's positive image in the East , and increase mutual tolerance and cooperation in the field of research and development .
<en> We need a separate debate on the subject of the Eastern partnership in the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , it was with great pleasure that I voted for this report , and I wish Mrs Dahl well on her maternity leave .
<en> Unfortunately , she could not be here today .
<en> It was a telling point that as a member of her IND / DEM Group she was willing to be rapporteur to play a constructive role in the work of our Parliament , unlike her colleagues from the so-called UK Independence Party , who , I believe - if I am right - have never been rapporteurs for any report in this Parliament in the four-and-a-half years since a motley crew of 12 of them were elected at the last European elections .
<en> All they do is snipe from the sidelines , usually on the basis of ignorance , because they are unwilling to get engaged in the real work that we are doing across the political spectrum in this House to ensure that the legislation and policies the Union produces are properly scrutinised and are a fair balance of interests of our different Member States and our different political viewpoints .
<en> All they want to do is be negative and oppose everything .
<en> What a contrast between them and their colleague .
<en> ( Written explanations of vote )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - One of the most important weapons in the arsenal of the rights of European citizens is that of petition .
<en> We have adopted further measures of a procedural nature .
<en> When a petition is signed by several persons , the signatories shall designate a representative and deputy representatives who shall be regarded as the petitioners for the purposes of implementation of the rules .
<en> The withdrawal of support for the petition by the petitioner is being remedied .
<en> It may be possible for petitions and correspondence with petitioners to be drafted in other languages used in Member State ( such as Basque and Galician ) .
<en> The committee responsible must establish the admissibility or otherwise of the petition .
<en> At the request of only quarter of the members of the committee the petition becomes admissible .
<en> Alternative means of redress may be recommended .
<en> Petitions , once registered , shall as general rule become public documents .
<sp>
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , I support Mr Onesta 's report , but appeal to you to consider two issues when considering petitions .
<2en> The first concerns the presentation of the facts and the second concerns the fact that only the petitioner can address the Commission , and not the respondent party .
<2en> In petition No. 0795 / 2007 , the facts are presented in a biased and tendentious way , and the party affected - the Bulgarian Orthodox Church - was not asked to present its position .
<2en> During its fact-finding mission in Bulgaria from 27-30 October 2008 , the Commission did not ask for the views of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church .
<2en> Thus attempts to vilify the Holy Orthodox Church in Bulgaria and to undermine its right to self-determination are promoted by the incorrect judgment on the petition submitted by the ' Alternative Synod ' , thereby creating conditions to mislead the members of the Commission .
<2en> The petitioners are seeking a way to decide the fate of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church not through church canon which has taken shape over centuries , but through the intervention of a secular institution - the ECJ in Strasbourg .
<2en> Following the schism within the Church which was resolved by canonical process in 1998 , the ECJ in Strasbourg has issued a judgment on the same internal ecclesiastical problem in a matter in which the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was not even a respondent .
<2en> The truth is that no secular court has the authority or the ability to rule on ecclesiastical disputes .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , the adverse impact of the global financial crisis can now be seen in international trade .
<en> One need only note that the rate of growth in global trade fell from 8.5 % in 2006 to 5.5 % in 2007 and was in the order of just 4 % in 2008 .
<en> A special mechanism has been introduced within the framework of the World Trade Organisation to monitor the measures that have been and are being adopted by the Member States of the organisation in order to support the sectors of the economy that have been hit .
<en> Given the particular importance of external trade to the economy , growth and employment in the European Union , the Commission is called upon , within the framework of the application of the economic recovery plan , to immediately assume a leading role in a multilateral initiative to support trade .
<en> It is also called upon to correlate any such initiative with the work of the World Bank group and other multilateral development organisations .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the international , political , military , economic and financial architecture is under pressure due to the current crisis .
<en> The EU is a central part of this architecture .
<en> It appeared as the only formula for Europe to preserve its role in the bipolar world .
<en> It enlarged successfully to reunite the continent at the end of the Cold War , and now it is called upon to preserve previous achievements and continue integration once better times come again .
<en> It is not an easy task , particularly for the current presidency , but also for the coming ones , which will have to deal with the continuing institutional impasse over the Lisbon Treaty and transition to a new Parliament and Commission , while fighting protectionist tendencies , threats to renationalise common policies and potential international crises in our neighbourhood .
<en> The EU is therefore at a crucial moment .
<en> It can either make it or break it .
<en> Our success will depend on complete understanding that solidarity is the only way in which we can face off all these great challenges and continue our odyssey in world affairs .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Following the parliamentary elections in Romania , the political parties representing the opposition are in a difficult situation at the moment .
<en> In fact , the parties in power are attempting to isolate and even exclude them from local political and administrative life .
<en> Replacing , on political grounds , local administration policy-makers during the current economic crisis highlights a lack of responsibility on the government 's part .
<en> This entails , as a result , the risk that the pace of completion of projects specifically aimed at local communities will slow down .
<en> The democratic credibility of the current government may be cast in doubt in the case of the two councillors from Braşov 's local municipal council , Vasile Bran and Iulian Mara , who were elected by local citizens and whose position has not been formalised eight months after the local elections .
<en> Vasile Bran 's election was unjustifiably invalidated by the decision of the local council , while Iulian Mara could not take the oath as the decision which validated his position was contested through administrative legal proceedings by the Prefect 's Institution for Braşov County .
<en> As a result of the preoccupation of the representatives of those in power with usurping local administration functions , without respecting the citizens ' wishes , the law was broken and the two councillors were replaced by two other people at the majority 's discretion .
<en> I feel the current government must be aware that winning a majority does not assume that you can flout the law .
<en> Abuses of this kind must be stopped and the law must be enforced .
<en> In fact , the citizens ' vote must not be invalidated by the dictatorship of the majority .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , last week an informal delegation of MEPs visited Palestine and Israel .
<en> We also visited the Gaza Strip .
<en> What we saw there has aroused in me a great feeling of outrage and strong feelings of sympathy towards the occupied Palestinian nation .
<en> The outrage I feel is shared by United Nations agencies which are active in that region .
<en> Mr President , I can see only one way out of this situation : a Palestinian State should be established very quickly and unconditionally .
<en> In 1948 , when their country was founded , the Jewish people did not ask the Palestinians for their consent .
<en> Today , Israel must not obstruct the will of the Palestinian people .
<en> I repeat : unconditional and urgent assistance should be provided to an oppressed nation , thus putting an end to this old conflict .
<en> I believe that such measures would strengthen peace in the whole world , but , above all , we should do it simply because the Palestinians deserve their own State .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I support this report which urges the Commission to remain vigilant and undertake a review of the scientific basis and adequacy of EMF limits through the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks ( SCENIHR ) .
<en> In this way consumers can continue to have a high level of protection without hampering the functioning and development of wireless technologies .
<en> Electromagnetic fields ( EMF ) are a matter of direct concern to EU citizens .
<en> A special Euro barometer on EMF indicated that Europeans are divided in their concerns about the potential health risks of EMF : 14 % not at all concerned , 35 % not very concerned , 35 % fairly concerned and 13 % very concerned .
<en> Several scientific studies on the matter have been published in recent years , however , none of them have provided clear evidence on possible effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless technology on human health .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the resolution on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields , as this is an issue that directly affects the entire European public , which is exposed to electromagnetic fields both at home and in the workplace .
<2en> Exposure to sources of man-made electromagnetic fields has been increasing substantially in recent years , largely driven by the growing demand for electricity and ever more specialised wireless technologies .
<2en> For this reason , I believe that it is extremely important to guarantee a high level of protection for all consumers without , however , hampering the operation of mobile telephony networks and the development of new wireless technologies .
<sp>
<2en> I voted against the own-initiative report by Mrs Ries .
<2en> It is the type of utterly useless report that some Members go crazy about , those same Members who take delight in applying the ' precautionary principle ' willy-nilly and who make a big fuss about the slightest ' concern ' amongst the public .
<2en> Whilst life expectancy for Europeans is increasing year on year , any new study of the possible effects of electromagnetic fields that raises unanswered questions is blown up out of all proportion .
<2en> On the other hand , dozens of studies by scientific academies and other genuinely competent bodies that have found that there is no real risk are systematically ignored .
<2en> Everything that is exaggerated is insignificant .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Mrs Ries 's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields .
<2en> It is essential to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers , especially children , without hampering the operation of mobile telephone networks .
<2en> Whilst no scientific proof has shown that the use of mobile telephones presents a health risk , this hypothesis cannot be definitively ruled out , so this matter must be included within the framework of the precautionary principle .
<2en> It is important regularly to update the limit values for public exposure to electromagnetic fields .
<2en> There is an urgent need , finally , to have more information available on the effects of electromagnetic waves and to set up a single system for authorising the installation of aerials and relays , as the report stresses .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I support this report which calls for further research to be carried out on electromagnetic fields emitted from devices such as radios , TVs , microwaves , mobile phones and high-voltage power lines .
<en> The report recommends that schools , crèches , retirement homes and hospitals should be kept away from mobile phone antennas or high-voltage power lines by a specific distance to be determined by scientific criteria .

<sp>
<2en> The PD-L ( Romanian Liberal Democrat Party ) contingent in the PPE-DE Group voted against the report on the discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2007 , which makes reference to the management of European funds by Romania and Bulgaria .
<2en> The report on the discharge , which refers to irregularities involving access to PHARE funds prior to 2007 , has retained the provision for drafting a special report on the management of Community funds in Romania and on measures recorded in the fight against corruption .
<2en> Consequently , the PD-L group in the European Parliament voted against the report .
<2en> This special report is not justified insofar as there is already a cooperation and verification mechanism available , approved by the European Council in December 2006 .
<2en> Drafting an additional report weakens the credibility of the cooperation and verification mechanism already in operation .
<2en> In fact , even the European Commission 's reaction , via its spokesman Mark Gray , confirms the futility of such a measure as long as there are already tried-and-tested mechanisms available for detecting any irregularities in the management of Community funds .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) I voted against the granting of discharge because the Committee of the Regions in its current form cannot be taken seriously by anyone .
<en> Among other things because of the opaque definition of the term region , the Committee of the Regions is an extremely heterogeneous entity on which , in addition to European nations , urban agglomerations , for instance , are represented .
<en> It is also very odd that the regions have , in recent times , organised themselves into political groups without having received any democratic mandate from the voters to do so .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - British Conservatives are opposed to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
<en> I dispute the notion that the EU can bestow and regulate fundamental rights .
<en> I am also especially opposed to the Charter of Fundamental Rights because it has been adopted by the EU despite the fact that neither of the vehicles intended for the Charter 's implementation - the EU Constitution and the Lisbon treaty - has been ratified .
<en> Setting up an agency to oversee the Charter of Fundamental Rights was a colossal waste of taxpayers ' money and an exercise in vanity .
<en> In fact , the same could be said for many of the EU 's agencies , which duplicate work done at national level and unashamedly promote the EU 's federalist agenda .
<en> Many people in my constituency see the huge sums wasted on this and other agencies as a kick in the teeth , especially at a time of economic crisis when they are giving up increasing amounts of their money in tax to fund the EU 's profligacy .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) I voted against the granting of discharge , given that the European Fundamental Rights Agency is a superfluous institution , which , moreover , is hostile to the right of freedom of expression .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the motion for a resolution on the challenges of deforestation and forest degradation , as I believe that deforestation results in very serious environmental damage which is hard to reverse , such as , for example , disruption of water conditions , desertification , impact on the climate and loss of biodiversity .
<2en> There needs to be greater coherence between forest conservation and sustainable management policies and other EU internal and external policies .
<2en> For this reason we need an evaluation of the impact on forests of EU policies on energy ( especially biofuels ) , agriculture and trade .
<2en> I also believe that financial support for developing countries is absolutely vital to halt tropical deforestation .
<2en> Reducing deforestation will play a very important role in the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , the debates and discussions around the fiscal system for savings have taken such a passionate turn that it has become disturbing .
<2en> I do not hesitate to defend what appears to be a minority position here , but we will see what happens tomorrow , even though our rapporteur and the commissioner are still mixing up the sheep and the goats .
<2en> Let us go back to the root of the problem .
<2en> The Directive on savings taxation came into force in 2005 with the aim of taxing the capital revenues of non-residents .
<2en> Two systems are involved here : exchange of information between tax authorities and withholding tax .
<2en> What are we finding after several years of operation ?
<2en> Official and unofficial studies all show that exchange of information is seriously failing , because it is complicated , burdensome and costly .
<2en> Withholding tax , on the other hand , shows many virtues .
<2en> What do you think is deduced from all this - above all by our rapporteur and the commissioner ?
<2en> Well , that the system that does not work and does not guarantee the payment of tax due will be made compulsory .
<2en> Understand that one if you can !
<2en> The issue is not lacking in piquancy , as it will also be noted that the system of withholding tax is constantly gaining ground in the various Member States - 19 out of 27 are applying it to their general satisfaction .
<2en> However , what is good enough at home becomes unacceptable once you cross the border .
<2en> This logic will just lead to an unravelling of what we have been building here for decades , in other words the single market in financial services .
<2en> The Community acquis of the free movement of capital is also called into question , as the so-called major countries are pushing for repatriation of their residents ' capital .
<2en> However , any blow can now be struck in the fight against this new Hydra of banking secrecy .
<2en> I say to my fellow Members who are fighting against this so-called monster that is guilty of all sins : you have chosen the wrong target by confusing the issues in the framework of this directive and , above all , you are deluding yourselves .
<2en> To finish , Madam President , I hope that many of my fellow Members will heed the voice of reason and vote for Amendment 28 by my group , which will lead to no less than allowing the Member States a free choice between withholding tax and exchange of information .

<2en> Madam President , Commissioner , I am sorry that Mr Visser did not stay to listen right to the end of the debate on this topic , but I must begin by saying that we support the Commission 's proposals in this direction .
<2en> A complete reform of VAT would , of course , do a much better job , but as this is not possible at the moment , your proposal should resolve some of the problems encountered by Member States in their desire to contain VAT fraud .
<2en> Particularly in the context of a crisis , we think that it is of paramount importance for VAT revenue to be guaranteed as , at the moment , Member States are trying to invest billions to support the economy .
<2en> In this respect , every opportunity to limit the chance of fraud should be supported by Parliament .
<2en> I would also like to say that we support on the whole the proposals made by Mr Visser in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
<2en> They will perhaps instil slightly greater confidence among the business sector , compared to the initial proposals from the Commission .
<2en> However , we also think that the suggestion made in Article 1 , point c ) that the period between the delivery of the goods and the receipt of notification referred to in the second subparagraph should be two years is fairly short and , in our view , creates additional opportunities for restricting the scope and results of the European Commission 's proposal .
<2en> This is why the PSE Group is suggesting that this period should be five years , which we believe is sufficiently short for the business sector , but also a long enough period for the tax administration to complete its work .
<2en> Furthermore , the introduction of this point c ) is not linked either to suggestions concerning from what date and how it will come into force , which we think will create additional problems for Member States .
<2en> We hope that the proposal will be supported and yield its expected results .
<sp>
<2en> Commissioner , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , against the backdrop of an economic and financial crisis , we must support the European Union in its efforts to achieve a more efficiently run and effective tax system .
<2en> The Commission 's proposal to amend the directive on taxation of savings in other Member States offers an opportunity to improve the existing scheme .
<2en> Those of us in the European Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs support extending its application to new financial instruments and geographical areas .
<2en> Europe 's Liberal Democrats proposed the inclusion of territories with particularly lightly regulated tax regimes , such as the states of Delaware and Nevada in the US , as well as an assurance of equal treatment between Member States and a reduction in the administrative burden involved with implementing the directive .
<2en> However , Commissioner , the basic debate remains whether to abolish the system of tax calculation at source in favour of the automated exchange of information .
<2en> From a Liberal viewpoint , the issue here is how we will manage to increase tax revenue collection and how enforcement only of the exchange of information will not result - a fact which is confirmed according to the research already carried out - in preventing tax abuses or in increasing revenue collection , but it will only deprive some Member States of their competitive advantage .
<2en> Taxation at source is not only more efficient , but also offers greater transparency during collection .
<2en> I firmly believe that Member States must retain their autonomy when it comes to selecting a taxation system .
<2en> The ALDE Group made the suggestion for a comparative analysis to be carried out of the two systems .
<2en> We hope that we will have the results from the Commission at least by December 2010 .
<2en> We also hope that these results will provide the basis for future Commission proposals on amending the savings taxation system within the European Union .
<2en> Tomorrow we are voting on another important text concerning VAT fraud relating to imports .
<2en> The objective of this directive is to ensure the rapid exchange of adequate , good-quality information .
<2en> In this case , five years is a fairly long period for the business sector .
<2en> It also aims to introduce a shared liability mechanism .
<2en> While protecting every Member State 's tax revenue , it is important however for us to ensure that joint liability only comes into play when the information supplied contains serious irregularities or there is an unjustified delay in providing it .
<2en> Otherwise , we risk imposing a further harmful burden on business .
<2en> I hope that we will vote in favour of these reports tomorrow .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Madam President , tax evasion is not our main problem when the world economy is being shaken to its foundations .
<en> It is true that we live with tax fraud throughout Europe , in the US and throughout the whole world , in fact .
<en> It is true that we have tax havens around the world where wealthy people and companies can put and leave money .
<en> However , that is not our main problem today .
<en> Focussing on this is a way of escaping our responsibility .
<en> What we need to do now , if we are to have any tax bases left at all in the future , is to get to grips with the financial crisis .
<en> Why do we find ourselves in the situation we are in now ?
<en> It is due , above all , to the fact that we now have ownerless capitalism .
<en> In practice , the financial undertakings , the large banks and the majority of the large companies are run by officials and these officials can introduce bonuses , severance payments and pensions that are all dependent on the profits of the company that these people manage .
<en> There is nothing in this world simpler than to increase profitability in the short term and thus the profits that these companies make .
<en> It is just a matter of increasing the risk .
<en> There are numerous studies of ' Taleb distributions ' , as we often call them , where , if you increase the risk substantially , you can count on profits rising dramatically and everyone can be given these bonuses and other benefits , in other words these ' perks ' .
<en> Then , of course , the risks start to become reality , but then those leading the company have already left or will have to leave .
<en> They get to buy chateaux in France or play golf in Spain .
<en> We should not feel sorry for them , but the system is quite simply unsustainable .
<en> Moreover , none of the players have any incentive to prevent this development .
<en> The credit rating agencies are dependent on getting customers , but they will have no customers if they say that their customers are not credit-worthy .
<en> Depositors know that there are deposit guarantees , and so do not need to worry about which bank they put their money into .
<en> Other players know that they can come to an agreement with the other party and count on the fact that they are too big to fail , while the taxpayer always picks up the bill .
<en> This means that the states must say at the outset that they will not take all the risks .
<en> It is an extremely difficult thing to do , but it must be done .
<en> Unfortunately , I do not believe that the European Parliament will cooperate on this , but I would recommend to everyone in this Parliament that they do so .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Contrary to my usual custom , I will begin with a political statement , as I find tax evasion and avoidance , in these times of increasing unemployment and increasing pay inequality , a real scandal .
<en> During the elections , it will become clear which parties are really willing to take this on .
<en> Mr Hamon 's report on taxation of savings income is an example of the question at hand .
<en> I realise that it is difficult for the Commissioner to reach true agreement on this under the unanimity rule .
<en> The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has more ambition than may be found in the Commission 's proposal , and this has been worked into a number of amendments which we have submitted .
<en> A final comment on Mrs Lulling , who contrasts the two systems of information exchange and taxation at source .
<en> I think that that is not really the point .
<en> We are talking about the loopholes that are present in the law in both systems and which are the points that we should focus on .
<en> Steps have been taken , but more needs to be done than the current report proposes .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) In our view , Sweden is synonymous with Europe .
<en> This country is the home of prosperity , security and freedom , where the issues of human rights and freedoms are just as important as economic and climate change concerns .
<en> Then we have the parliament of an EU Member State which adopted a language law on 30 June 2009 stipulating that if anyone , including all of you , does not call that country 's capital city by its name in the country 's official language , Bratislava , but uses its German name , Presburg , or Hungarian name , Pozsony , they may very well end up paying a fine of EUR 5 000 .
<en> The explanatory memorandum to the language law amendment states that protection of the national language in certain cases overrides the freedom of speech and right to privacy .
<en> A European Union which adopts such a law is no longer a Europe of freedom .
<en> I ask the Swedish Presidency to do its utmost to ensure that this law is repealed and that the Slovak head of state does not sign it .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) I would like to draw your attention to two of the Swedish Presidency 's priorities which I was delighted to see on this list .
<en> The first of these priorities is the unequivocal opposition to discrimination , racism , anti-Semitism , xenophobia and homophobia .
<en> I think that the importance of this issue is particularly underlined by the fact that we saw how evident the level of support was for the far right in several European countries during the European Parliament elections .
<en> This therefore makes it the responsibility of every one of us , including Parliament and the current Presidency , to ensure that the most vulnerable do not end up in a precarious situation .
<en> In particular , we must do everything to ensure that there is no cooperation between those parties professing to be democratic and the extremist parties .
<en> A very good example of this is the Slovak language law , mentioned already today on several occasions , which is severely discriminatory , as was described .
<en> The second priority which I would like to welcome is the series of European measures to be adopted , aimed at the integration of Roma communities .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , continuation of enlargement of the European Union and the future of the Treaty of Lisbon are among the objectives of the Swedish Presidency .
<en> The German Constitutional Tribunal ruled recently that the Treaty of Lisbon can be accepted only on condition that the precedence of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat are safeguarded , which calls into question the idea of European federalism .
<en> The Treaty of Lisbon has , therefore , turned out to be a legal monster , which has been noticed not only by the Germans , but also by the Irish in a referendum and by the Presidents of the Czech Republic and Poland .
<en> In this context the Swedish Presidency should initiate a Europe-wide debate on the subject of the role of the national parliaments of all the 27 Member States , and should develop a new model of cooperation between sovereign European nations .
<en> It is , therefore , to be hoped that the Swedish Presidency , which I wish much success , will listen with greater attention to the voice of the citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( MT ) I would also like to laud Prime Minister Reinfeld for staying with us until the very end of this discussion .
<en> We will be looking to the Presidency to implement three important priorities .
<en> The first is the Stockholm Programme on the area of justice , freedom and security .
<en> We have to ensure that agreement is reached on this programme as soon as possible .
<en> The second priority is the implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum .
<en> We will be looking to you Prime Minister to ensure that you will implement the Pact that was agreed upon last year .
<en> Thirdly , last month , during the European Council , agreement was reached regarding the pilot project on burden sharing in the field of immigration .
<en> You have a great deal of work ahead of you Prime Minister , and we , together with our President , will be monitoring you closely to guarantee that this work is carried out .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Since Dag Hammarskjöld , Sweden has distinguished itself as a member of the United Nations ( UN ) .
<en> It therefore knows that , without bodies with universally recognised legitimacy and representativeness , there will be no political force to conclude Kyoto2 , the Doha Round or the Millennium Development Goals , or to regulate the global economy , not to mention defend human rights .
<en> It is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency is resigning itself to the informal and disputed framework of the G20 .
<en> It is tragic that the EU - this locomotive of the world according to Mr Barroso , who was citing the UN Secretary-General - is leaderless and lacking in any strategic vision in this area , at a time when President Obama is proclaiming his commitment to global governance .
<en> Instead , on our side , we have only heard the Pope insisting on the urgent need to reorganise the UN Security Council and the Bretton Woods Institutions .
<en> Mr President , why is the Swedish Presidency refusing to lead Europe into forcing reform of the UN Security Council , by demanding a seat at the table for the European Union with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the referendum in Ireland .
<en> I should like to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden to the House today , who is representing the Swedish Presidency .
<en> We are very happy to have you with us , but there was a problem of formalities .
<en> I am very sorry about that .
<en> President Barroso , it is great that you , too , are with us at such an important moment for our European Union .
<en> Thank you very much .
<en> You can see how difficult it is sometimes to go through all the formalities , but we are a very democratic institution , as you can see .
<en> It is always necessary to go through everything in order .
<en> Then everything is OK and we can agree .
<en> We shall now go to the main item on this afternoon 's agenda .
<en> It is very important for us to have you in the Chamber to discuss such an important topic .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , I am very grateful to be here today and to have the opportunity to address the European Parliament so soon after the positive result in the referendum in Ireland .
<en> I pay tribute to Brian Cowen and his associates ; I also say to all of those who have been engaged in the campaign , whatever their party or background , who contributed to this successful outcome : thank you for all your efforts .
<en> This was a good decision for Ireland ; it is a good decision for Europe .
<en> I think that we can say that Europe has listened to the criticism ; I know that the legal guarantees offered by the European Council were decisive in the referendum campaign .
<en> I can also say that the French and the Czech Presidencies made efforts that were crucial to find a way to meet the concerns of the Irish people .
<en> I think we should also say that it was very positive to have the very strong majority that was shown in the referendum , a convincing majority of 67.1 % and with a high turnout , as high as 59 % .
<en> So , all of this is very good news for Europe .
<en> And , of course , I do not have to explain to this Parliament the need to put the Lisbon Treaty in place .
<en> It will allow you to be more democratic , to be more efficient , and to be more transparent .
<en> It will , in fact , increase the influence of the EU in the international arena and make us stronger in meeting global challenges , and I know that you in this Parliament will also be given a more significant role in the overall decision-making process .
<en> I welcome this development .
<en> Therefore , it is very important to put this Lisbon Treaty into force .
<en> The European Council is united in its wish for the Treaty to enter into force by the end of this year and the end of the Swedish Presidency .
<en> With the number of countries that have ratified it - we are now at 24 with full ratification - country number 25 might actually be Poland , given the signals that we are now getting from the Polish President .
<en> I spoke on Saturday , after the referendum result from Ireland was known , with the Taoiseach Brian Cowen , who said they would need a couple of weeks to secure full parliamentary ratification , and therefore we can also say that country number 26 will finally be Ireland .
<en> That leaves us just the Czech Republic to have the full 27 ratifications .
<en> To that end , we have had a meeting with the three institutions here in Brussels today : the Presidency , the head of the Commission , Jose Manuel Barroso , and the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek .
<en> The Czech Prime Minister , Jan Fischer , was also with us and we tried to asses this situation .
<en> You might know that 17 senators have appealed to the Constitutional Court in the Czech Republic with a complaint concerning the Lisbon Treaty , to see if it is in accordance with the Czech Constitution .
<en> Jan Fischer told us that this is an independent court which is now working quickly to take the decision whether or not to bring up this petition .
<en> We do not foresee today an exact date when they will give this decision , and we are , of course , awaiting that signal .
<en> We hope to see it in just a week or a couple of weeks .
<en> That is the message from the Czech Republic today : an independent court taking a decision in maybe a week 's time , or it may be two weeks before we know how they will proceed .
<en> As President of the European Council , I am responsible for moving the work of the Union forward .
<en> I strongly feel that we have no time to lose .
<en> Therefore , I have decided that while awaiting the clarifications in the Czech Republic , firstly we will continue the preparations for the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and secondly , when there is clarity on when the Lisbon Treaty will come into force , when there is clarity , I will begin consultations on the nominations of the new President of the European Council and the High Representative and Secretary-General of the Council .
<en> Preparing this will not only be a matter for the Presidency : this is a matter for three institutions at the same time .
<en> I will therefore say that it is very important for us to work closely and constructively together with the Commission and the European Parliament in this process .
<en> I will again renew my offer to this Parliament to cooperate when we are making our efforts to get the Lisbon Treaty finally in place .
<en> Let us also remember that despite these institutional matters , this Swedish Presidency - and this autumn - is , of course , very much influenced by the need to move on climate change , the need to move on the financial crisis , the worry in Europe that we need a policy for job creation - a lot of important matters that need to be addressed .
<en> That sums up for us the need to be active , to put in place the Lisbon Treaty , as I have just said , and to stay active as a Presidency on these very important matters for our voters .
<sp>
<en> Prime Minister , thank you for your very clear message regarding all that is going on after the vote in Ireland , and also for the very clear message on cooperation between the European Parliament and the Presidency of the European Council .
<en> We have just started discussions with Mrs Malmström , a former Member of the European Parliament , whom we remember very well .
<en> Thank you very much for your proposal and very clear message .
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - Mr President , the Irish people took a very important and historic decision last weekend : a very important decision for Ireland ; a very important decision for Europe .
<en> The Irish people , by a resounding majority , recognised the importance of the Lisbon Treaty , a Treaty that offers a more democratic and effective Europe , a Treaty that gives us the right platform to deliver the modern , successful European Union our citizens wish to see .
<en> The Treaty now has the democratic endorsement of all 27 Member States .
<en> All the Member States of the European Union , by parliament or by popular vote , have approved the Treaty .
<en> This is indeed a major achievement .
<en> It shows how the enlarged Europe is able to share a vision for our future and a determination to move forward .
<en> It was decided democratically .
<en> Now what we need is the ratification procedures to be concluded .
<en> I am pleased to see that President Kaczyński of Poland will be signing very soon .
<en> As he has always said to me , he will be ready to do it when the Irish have voted ' yes ' .
<en> This is indeed very good news .
<en> Of course , we have to see the completion of the process in the Czech Republic .
<en> We need to respect the constitutional proceedings in that country , as we have done in other countries , but once these procedures are concluded , I see no reason why proceedings cannot be concluded swiftly .
<en> This is important for Europe as a whole , but it is particularly important for the Commission .
<en> I want to see the new Commission in place , a Commission in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty , and I want to see it in office as quickly as possible .
<en> A long period with a caretaker Commission is in nobody 's interest .
<en> I am ready to start the formation of the next Commission as soon as the Council is ready to clarify the legal basis definitively , and also to nominate the High Representative who will become Vice-President of the Commission .
<en> I appreciate all the efforts made by the Swedish Presidency , and personally by Prime Minister Reinfeldt , to reach a swift conclusion to all these processes .
<en> The initiative that Prime Minister Reinfeldt took today at a meeting with me and with you , President Buzek , and the video conference with Prime Minister Fischer , was a very good and useful initiative .
<en> I also know that this Parliament has worked tirelessly to promote the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> Parliament and Commission have worked hand in hand to explain why it is the right treaty for Europe .
<en> I am proud of the role that the Commission played in giving the Irish people the information they needed to make up their minds .
<en> Now that we have a real probability of having the Lisbon Treaty finally ratified and the whole process completed , we can turn our attention to the work to implement the Treaty .
<en> I would like to take this occasion to highlight four areas where we are working hard to ensure that we can hit the ground running when the Treaty comes into force .
<en> One of the most important and the most complex has to be the innovations regarding the European External Action Service .
<en> We have been working hard to think through some of the practical details of how we can make the European External Action Service a real success .
<en> This work will now accelerate and , in the same spirit as the remarks made just now by the Swedish Presidency , I want to state the European Commission 's determination to work with Parliament to achieve that objective .
<en> I know that Elmar Brok has been leading on this subject here in Parliament .
<en> I understand that you will debate this at the next plenary .
<en> This is excellent timing since this will take place shortly before the same question is discussed at the European Council .
<en> I think that report is an excellent basis for discussions between our institutions , and I welcome the strong Community spirit that inspires the report .
<en> This is exactly the spirit that I will uphold in the preparation for the important innovation that is the European External Service .
<en> Another point is comitology .
<en> It is an important aspect of how the European Union does its business .
<en> The Treaty of Lisbon introduces new rules making the system more rational and transparent .
<en> We need to fix exactly how the new system should work .
<en> But let me be clear : many of these decisions are of great political importance and deserve proper democratic scrutiny and real political ownership .
<en> So we need to maintain the strong role played by Parliament today .
<en> Another important democratic element is the new mechanisms to allow national parliaments a direct say on subsidiarity .
<en> We need to put these mechanisms in the broader context of the excellent relations with national parliaments built up by the Commission , and indeed the European Parliament , over the last few years .
<en> Finally , I would like to mention the European Citizens ' Initiative .
<en> This is one of the most striking innovations on the Treaty 's democratic agenda and one on which this Parliament has already worked in detail .
<en> Margot Wallström has been leading our work in developing a green paper to launch a consultation as soon as possible , with the goal of seeing this opportunity in citizens ' hands within a year of entry into force .
<en> When I spoke to this Parliament last month , I set out what I saw as the greatest challenges and the great opportunities facing Europe today .
<en> With the Lisbon Treaty , we will have the right springboard to help us make those goals a reality , and I am sure that with this constructive partnership between our institutions , we will make it a success .
<en> That is the commitment of the European Commission .
<sp>
<en> President Barroso , thank you for your speech , and for your readiness to cooperate in the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> The cooperation between Parliament and the Council during the videoconference with Prime Minister Jan Fischer of the Czech Republic was also excellent , so thank you once again , Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt , for organising that video conference .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , here we are once again discussing the crisis in the milk sector .
<2en> The dramatic nature of this crisis continues to concern us , just as European farmers continue to express their hardship and voice their fears for the future .
<2en> Parliament has already expressed its views on this matter , both by adopting a resolution with our proposals and by adopting the Commission proposal to extend the intervention period for milk powder and butter , to which we added the request for the measure on the private storage of cheese .
<2en> At that time , we pointed out that the measures proposed by the Commission did not go nearly far enough .
<2en> We now have to decide whether or not to allow the urgent procedure for the extension of Article 186 of the single CMO Regulation to the dairy sector , namely the possibility for the Commission to decide , in the event of a market crisis , to implement emergency measures without going through the normal procedure in Parliament .
<2en> Yesterday evening , an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was held to discuss this , with Mrs Fischer Boel attending .
<2en> Firstly I , and the committee which it is my honour to chair , would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to us in Parliament right at the end of the Agricultural Council which was held in Luxembourg .
<2en> This gesture was one of great attentiveness which we appreciated .
<2en> Yesterday evening , the debate was very spirited , Mr President , and our fellow Members voiced a lot of criticism .
<2en> First of all , it was pointed out that the Commission was very slow to act , and did not adequately grasp the seriousness of the crisis under way .
<2en> Then the objection was raised that Article 186 deprives Parliament of its decision-making prerogatives , thereby giving carte blanche to the Commission .
<2en> It was also said that the Commission should have made more funds available to tackle the crisis .
<2en> These are legitimate concerns which we agree with in part .
<2en> Nevertheless , Mr President , I feel compelled to admit that the Commission has made considerable efforts and progress , showing that it takes Parliament 's opinion and wishes seriously .
<2en> It has explained how it intends to use a fund of EUR 280 million - which , I would remind you , we will be voting on this Thursday in the context of approval of the 2010 budget - and set out some of the measures it will implement , such as the private storage of cheese and raising the ceiling of de minimis aid from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 , as requested in our resolution which was adopted in September .
<2en> Although I am aware that all this still does not go far enough , I nevertheless believe , Mr President , that today we should vote in favour of the urgent procedure .
<2en> European farmers expect immediate answers and too much time has already been wasted .
<2en> Today we must take responsibility for speeding things up in order to face the crisis head on .
<2en> Let us show , ladies and gentlemen , the same responsibility which pervades our preparations for the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon with codecision in agricultural matters .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are arguing against the urgent procedure , not because we do not believe that there is an urgent need for measures , but because we believe that the Commission is not implementing the right measures and is not willing and able to solve the current crisis in the dairy sector .
<en> The Commission is not part of the solution to the problem , but is actually the problem .
<en> We must point out , therefore , that the Commission has caused part of the problems itself by increasing the quantity of milk .
<en> It failed to react in any way for months as the crisis went on .
<en> The Commissioner told us as recently as four weeks ago that there were no problems , that the market would improve and that we must be patient .
<en> This , of all Commissions , is the Commission to which we are handing our powers and this , of all Commissions , is the Commission from which we are expecting help .
<en> No , I do not think that is the right way to proceed .
<en> Even yesterday , the Commission was unable to tell us what the additional funds are to be spent on .
<en> The Commission talks of restructuring .
<en> Over recent years , all restructuring has meant has been fewer and fewer dairy farmers .
<en> The Commission has also failed to say how it intends to reinforce the producer organisations going forwards .
<en> No , it wants to continue paying out export refunds .
<en> We have also heard no answer about how we are to strengthen the producers ' position in their struggle against the supermarkets .
<en> The Commission was unable to put forward any solution in this regard yesterday either .
<en> In the light of all this , we are highly doubtful that the Commission is wholeheartedly working to resolve this crisis .
<en> We are writing a blank cheque without knowing what the Commission is doing , how it is doing it and with what it intends to do it .
<en> Yet another issue was the crucial reason for our decision to reject this procedure , however .
<en> We , Parliament , have long been fighting for more rights - particularly in the field of agriculture .
<en> Yet just as we are on the verge of the Treaty of Lisbon being ratified , the first thing we do is to give these rights away again !
<en> That simply cannot be allowed to happen .
<en> As a new Member of this House , this strikes me as somewhat extraordinary .
<en> We must exercise our rights , we must hold the debates in this House and we must keep our hand on the tiller .
<en> We , too , have responsibility here , I am happy to accept that .
<en> We must not , however , give up any responsibility .
<en> Rather , as parliamentarians , that responsibility is our calling .
<en> We must provide the dairy farmers with serious and long-lasting help .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the request to use the urgent procedure put forward by the Commission is certainly not perfect .
<en> I can partially agree with what the previous speaker said .
<en> However , to not allow this request to use the urgent procedure now would send completely the wrong signals to the dairy farmers , who are expecting at least initial responses .
<en> That is why I support this request to use the urgent procedure .
<en> In the course of this procedure , we will have the opportunity to improve the motion by means of amendments and , as Mr Häusling suggested , to cede powers .
<en> It is absolutely the case that there are possibilities to put a time limit on these powers so that we only give the Commission a power for two years before we then decide on the matter again .
<en> I would therefore ask for your support in order to put this request for use of the urgent procedure on the agenda .
<en> ( Applause )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the Commission 's statement on the use of minority languages within the framework of the European cultural heritage .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , honourable Members , the general objective of the European Union 's policy on multilingualism is to highlight the importance of all the languages spoken in the European Union .
<2en> In accordance with Article 151 of the treaty , the Community 's actions must help encourage cooperation between Member States in order to contribute to the flourishing of Member States ' cultures , while respecting at the same time their diversity at national and regional level and focusing on our common cultural heritage .
<2en> Based on these principles , the European Commission , in close cooperation with Member States , is implementing the strategy of promoting multilingualism and linguistic diversity , featuring in the document adopted in September 2008 , which is aimed at all the languages spoken in the Community .
<2en> All these languages represent an integral part of our common cultural heritage , and every single national , regional , minority and migrants ' language spoken in Europe offers an additional facet to this common cultural heritage .
<2en> As you are well aware , the European Commission has invited Member States to consider teaching regional and minority languages as part of their national strategies for promoting multilingualism in society .
<2en> The decisions made by the European Union in this area are not replacing the measures already adopted by Member States , but are intended to support and supplement them .
<2en> The main funding instruments available to the European Union are the Lifelong Learning Programme for the 2007-2013 period , which is open to all the languages spoken in the Community , including regional and minority languages .
<2en> There is no Community legislation for regulating the use of languages in Member States and none of the treaties includes options for adopting such provisions either .
<2en> Respect for linguistic and cultural diversity is enshrined via Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which stipulates that the Union must respect cultural and linguistic diversity .
<2en> As you know , the provisions of the Charter are aimed at the EU 's institutions and bodies , as well as Member States , only when they implement Community legislation .
<2en> Consequently , Member States continue to be the decision makers on their domestic linguistic policy , including with regard to regional and minority languages .
<2en> The protection of persons belonging to national minorities is an integral part of respecting human rights , which is one of the principles on which the European Union has been created , as indicated in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union .
<2en> As a result , Member States should use every legal instrument they have available to safeguard the rights of persons belonging to national minorities , in accordance with their own constitutional order and with the obligations and commitments incumbent upon them under international law .
<2en> By international law I mean , for example , the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of the Council of Europe , which provides a global framework in this area , as well as the recommendations from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which the European Union has resorted to on different occasions .
<sp>
<2en> The languages of Europe 's peoples as a cultural whole form the cultural heritage of Europe , just as the Commissioner has also said .
<2en> I thank him for making this point .
<2en> There are no differences between languages , whether they are spoken by a minority or majority .
<2en> At the same time , people 's right to use their own language is an integral part of their basic rights , as is also stated in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<2en> It is no coincidence that national communities are extremely sensitive about any infringement of their rights in this area .
<2en> I am speaking out , on behalf of a minority numbering more than half a million , against Slovakia 's national language law containing certain articles which infringe and restrict the rights of this minority .
<2en> Let me give you a few examples .
<2en> Article 8 ( 4 ) of the law stipulates that doctors must communicate in the national language with patients in locations where the minority 's proportion is less than 20 % .
<2en> This also applies to social workers and their clients , as well as to fire-fighters and paramedics , if they are on duty , in other words , when putting out a fire or taking someone to hospital .
<2en> According to Article 6 ( 1 ) , Slovak must be used in the text of adverts , whether public or private .
<2en> According to Article 8 ( 6 ) , adverts must appear first and larger in the national language , or the letters must be at least as big as those in the text in the second language .
<2en> This obviously conveys the message that the first language is more important , while the second is subordinate and second-class .
<2en> Article 9 of the law imposes penalties that are disproportionate on legal entities contravening the appropriate language use , including small businesses .
<2en> In any case , why is it a punishable offence for someone to speak in their mother tongue ?
<2en> Such a law cannot , obviously , be implemented properly .
<2en> Mr President , Slovak legislation could have integrated as part of its domestic legal system those commitments which it accepted from the Council of Europe 's Charter on languages and assumed through ratification , instead of approving a law which is diametrically opposed to this .
<2en> It is not even aimed at bilingualism , as it does not require workers , even in the public sector , to know the minority language , nor encourage them to learn it .
<2en> Mr President , just a final word .
<2en> I am pleased that the European Parliament has put this debate on the agenda and I greatly appreciate the clear stance adopted by the Parliament 's President , Jerzy Buzek , as well as the unequivocal message from the Commission that minority rights must be protected , not restricted .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the S & D Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , given all the differences of opinion in this House , it is a good sign that we have a president here of Hungarian stock of whom we can be sure that he will not act in a discriminatory manner , but that it is simply a natural matter of course in this Europe that the attempt is made to stick to what is right irrespective of language and origin .
<en> Mrs Bauer , you were critical of the language law .
<en> The language law is not as good as it might be , that has indeed been established .
<en> It does not infringe fundamental rights , however .
<en> That too must be stated .
<en> That being the case , there is a need to work on eliminating those deficiencies that do exist - above all , in the interpretation of the law .
<en> It is absolutely crucial that a signal be sent from this debate today that we are making improvements not because we want to play off one population group against the other but because we want the relations between Slovaks and Hungarians within Slovakia , and of course , also between the two countries , to improve .
<en> That must be our concern .
<en> Especially now , as we approach the elections , I can but call for moderation , reason and dialogue , which offer the road to a positive result .
<en> Quite simply , there are also problems with an historical basis , and we should have no illusions about that .
<en> My mother , who was born in Miskolc , and I , born just a few kilometres from Bratislava , feel and sense that .
<en> The crucial thing , however , is that we do not magnify and heat up conflicts that often fundamentally only exist between political powers and not between the people themselves , who get along well .
<en> Just as there is a Hungarian minority in Slovakia , so there is also a Slovak minority in many a municipality with a Hungarian majority within Slovakia .
<en> We must therefore bring these elements together .
<en> The second signal sent from this debate is also a crucial factor .
<en> Together , we have a range of problems .
<en> Slovakia and Hungary , too , have problems together , such as the problem of the Romani .
<en> Would it not , then , be much more sensible to concentrate on solving these existing problems together via dialogue , in an effort to give all the minorities of this region a better chance ?
<en> In the end , we are all members of minorities .
<en> The aim must be that we clearly commit ourselves to linguistic diversity - as the Commissioner said - to promoting multilingualism , since languages are an ' asset ' .
<en> People who can speak additional languages have an advantage , and when everyone understands that and accepts it , we will be able to look forward to a better future .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am pleased that the Commission has taken this issue seriously .
<2en> Life for many minority groups in Europe is difficult , and a strong message from the EU in particular may help to counteract the wave of intolerance that has swept over our part of the world in recent years .
<2en> I think that the EU should make it absolutely clear to every European that there is added value in both having and speaking languages other than the language of the majority .
<2en> Why ?
<2en> Well , for one thing , because every language carries with it an enormous cultural heritage that enriches European diversity .
<2en> Areas where minority languages are spoken are also more successful and competitive from an economic point of view than other areas .
<2en> It is therefore beneficial for anyone who wants to do business in such areas to employ people who speak the local languages .
<2en> Those were two good reasons .
<2en> I would like to thank the Commission for this initiative and I will not detain us any longer as time is limited .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the compromise package on tyre labelling .
<en> This Parliament deals with many issues which appear extremely technical and , at first glance , are not high on many people 's political agenda ; this is perhaps one such issue .
<en> However , closer examination reveals that almost a quarter of CO2 emissions come from road transport and that tyres play a significant role in determining fuel efficiency .
<en> This proposed legislation therefore plays an important part in wider EU efforts to tackle global warming .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report in particular because it contributes to two essential points : improving the information available , which facilitates a more environmentally friendly choice of tyres , and the fact that , by making such a choice , we will be contributing to greater energy efficiency , given that tyres are responsible for 20 to 30 % of the total energy use of vehicles .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a regulation on the labelling of tyres approved today by this House is a crucial step towards marketing safe and quiet products that also allow fuel consumption to be minimised .
<2en> The fact that the legal form of the proposal has been amended from a directive to a regulation is particularly welcome .
<2en> This will allow us to achieve the equal and immediate application of all the provisions in all Member States , ensuring more effective harmonisation of the European tyre market .
<2en> Moreover , the effort put into the negotiations by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy concerning flexibility in displaying the label will offer consumers adequate protection while simultaneously ensuring that manufacturers are not burdened with excessive bureaucracy .
<2en> The interim provision of exempting tyres manufactured before 2012 from the obligations of the regulation also constitutes a necessary measure for the purposes of ensuring a gradual phasing-in of the new European regulations in the market .
<2en> For these reasons , we can therefore say we are satisfied with the common position achieved , in the certainty that it corresponds to the aims of the Commission 's initial proposal .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the regulation on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency .
<2en> This regulation is part of the legislative package concerning energy efficiency and will help cut polluting emissions produced by the transport sector .
<2en> According to this regulation , tyre suppliers must use labels and stickers to provide users with information about fuel consumption and running resistance , wet grip and external rolling noise .
<2en> In practical terms , the label will indicate for these parameters the level from A to G which the tyre is classified as .
<2en> Tyre suppliers also have the duty to provide explanations on their website about these indicators , as well as recommendations concerning driver behaviour .
<2en> These recommendations include the need for eco-driving , checking the tyre pressure regularly and complying with the stopping distance .
<2en> Member States will publish by 1 November 2011 all the provisions laid down by law and administrative actions required to transpose the regulation into national legislation .
<2en> The provisions of this regulation will be enforced from 1 November 2012 .
<2en> The transport sector is responsible for approximately 25 % of polluting emissions .
<2en> This is why this regulation will help reduce these emissions .
<sp>
<2en> The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGAF ) aims to support workers personally affected by redundancies resulting from major changes in world trade .
<2en> More specifically , the EGAF finances job-search assistance , tailor-made retraining , entrepreneurship promotion , aid for self-employment and special temporary income supplements .
<2en> In the longer term , these measures aim to help these workers find and hold on to a new job .
<2en> My country , Portugal , has benefited from the EGAF twice : in 2008 , following 1 549 redundancies in the car industry in the Lisbon region and in Alentejo , and in 2009 , following 1 504 redundancies in 49 textile companies in the northern and central regions of the country .
<2en> The crucial role of this fund is clear .
<2en> However , the question asked by Mrs Berès highlights that there is a situation that should be clarified by the European Commission .
<2en> We must prevent the allocation of funds or State aid in a Member State resulting in job losses in other areas of the EU .
<2en> I therefore agree with the need to guarantee effective coordination of European financial aid , preventing companies from seeking to profit by creating and cutting jobs .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , may I start by expressing my full solidarity with the fight by the trade unionists in the European Parliament and wishing them every success .
<en> A massive wave of anti-labour measures is being unleashed by the Greek Government and flexible forms of work are being made the rule and imposed across the board .
<en> The social security system is also being decimated and wages and pensions are being frozen .
<en> The Greek Government , the European Union and the representatives of capital are trying to terrorise workers by brandishing the bugbear of Greece 's budget deficit and public debt .
<en> They are engaging the workers in social dialogue , which is a set-up , in order to force them into consent , limit their justified anger and divert grassroots reaction .
<en> The first response to the anti-grassroots attack by the government and the European Union will be the national strike on 17 December announced and organised by the All Workers Militant Front ( PAME ) .
<en> They are demanding measures to satisfy modern grassroots requirements which can only be met by a united front of the working classes , the poor and middle classes in the towns and countryside , to confront and overthrow the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , on 8 December , the ESDP mission , Operation Atalanta , celebrated one year of existence .
<en> According to the Swedish Presidency , the operation has demonstrated its ability to counter piracy effectively and there has been a significant fall in attacks .
<en> That last statement , however , is highly questionable .
<en> According to a report by the International Maritime Bureau , in the first nine months of 2009 , there were more attacks in total than in the whole of 2008 .
<en> The number of armed attacks also rose by 200 % overall .
<en> The financial efficiency of this operation is also highly questionable .
<en> The cost of damage caused by piracy in this region is estimated to be USD 200 million in total , whereas the EU and its Member States are investing USD 408 million per year .
<en> The new planned ESDP mission in Somalia , once again , will not get to the root of the problem , but merely deal with the symptoms .
<en> What would really be worthwhile would be for the EU to set up an effective coastal watch to prevent illegal fishing ...

<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , the SESAR programme , which aims to modernise air traffic management in Europe , is a major project .
<en> How is the Commission going to prepare for the forthcoming SESAR deployment phase and , in particular , for the financing of this programme , which is essential both for the environment and for our scientific and technical standing ?
<en> Will the Commission follow the recommendations of the 2007 report , according to which a highly qualified individual should ensure political monitoring of this programme ?
<en> Indeed , a number of obstacles will have to be overcome - of a legal , psychological and technical nature - to unite national airspaces and to succeed in getting controllers from the various countries to work together .
<en> If Europe is not able to create a single airspace , how will it be able to build a strong political union ?
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , given that both you and the Commission expressed your intention to monitor the implementation of Slovakia 's national language law , I would like to draw your attention to the following points .
<en> The government has published the implementing provision , which not only overrides laws , but also introduces further restrictions .
<en> The implementation proposal specifies that the law 's legitimate purpose is solely to protect and support the national language in official dealings , as well as to protect the rights of users of the national language .
<en> It states that , in the case of natural persons and legal entities , the protection of these rights has as its legitimate aim interference with fundamental rights and freedoms .
<en> It is therefore glaringly obvious that this is a reference to the rights and freedoms of persons belonging to minorities .
<en> The implementing measure also points out that , regardless of whether the proportion is above or below 20 % , the minority language can only be used anywhere if a third person who is present agrees to this .
<en> I think that this absurdity is unacceptable in Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , at the last EU-Russia Summit , the parties signed a memorandum on the principles of an early warning mechanism on energy matters .
<en> The European Commission hopes that in future , this will allow us to avoid an energy crisis similar to the one we experienced at the beginning of the year , when the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the supply and transit of gas resulted in Moscow cutting off the supply of gas for nearly three weeks , effectively paralysing several European countries .
<en> The approaching winter and the associated increase in gas consumption mean that we have to develop principles which should govern the European energy market .
<en> The European Union must understand that breaks in gas supply are not only a threat to the economy , but they also threaten the foundations of European integration , which , strengthened by European solidarity , support the free market .
<en> I also hope that this winter will not have to be a test of the truth of the declarations made , and of whether solidarity is an insignificant , empty word or a real guarantee of cooperation between Member States of the European Union .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> At the conciliation meeting of 18 November 2009 , the Flexibility Instrument was mobilised to finance the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear plant to the sum of EUR 75 million in 2010 .
<2en> I deplore the fact that the Commission only presented these financing needs in Amending Letter No 2 / 2010 after Parliament 's first reading , in other words , after Parliament had set its priorities .
<2en> That created additional pressure on subheading 1a , considerably affecting the dynamics of the negotiations on the 2010 budget and jeopardising Parliament 's political priorities .
<2en> Nonetheless , promises once made have to be kept , as in the case of the protocol concerning the conditions for the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union , which contains the EU 's commitment to finance the decommissioning of Kozloduy .
<2en> The additional financing needs in 2011-2013 , totalling EUR 225 million , must be addressed in a mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework .
<2en> Further financing of Kozloduy in 2011-2013 should be without prejudice to the financing of existing multiannual programmes and actions .
<2en> I therefore voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> The use of this fund is based on the logic behind the energy strand of the European economic recovery plan .
<2en> I shall abstain for the same reasons .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The recovery plan has been one of the Commission 's responses to the economic crisis that has plagued Europe in recent years .
<en> Its goals include restoring business as well as consumer confidence and , in particular , ensuring that lending is carried out .
<en> There has been a need to be flexible and allow for funds to be reallocated from different budgets when necessary .
<en> This is why I have to support the rapporteur 's views and vote in favour of the proposal .
<sp>
<2en> The European Economic Recovery Plan ( EERP ) , to which the sum of EUR 5 billion was allocated by Parliament in March 2009 , is divided into trans-European energy projects and projects to develop broadband Internet in rural areas .
<2en> This is an important instrument for tackling the economic crisis , reviving the economy and hence creating jobs .
<2en> During the conciliation meeting of 18 November , an agreement was reached by Parliament , the Council and the Commission on financing for the second year ( 2010 ) of the EERP , to the sum of EUR 2.4 billion .
<2en> This financing , for energy and broadband Internet projects , requires a review of the multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 .
<2en> Financing of the EERP should not be postponed to subsequent years , and I therefore welcome the agreement that was reached .
<2en> I would also point out that the current multiannual financial framework does not meet the European Union 's financial needs .
<2en> Consequently , the Commission should urgently submit a proposal for a mid-term review of the MFF .
<2en> I also endorse the need to extend the 2007-2013 MFF to the years 2015-2016 .
<2en> I therefore voted in favour .
<sp>
<2en> Even if some positive use is made of the funds being mobilised here , they are still far from enough to address rural areas ' need for support .
<2en> Agriculture in the countries of the European Union has many other needs and the farmers who work the land are calling for an agricultural policy that encourages production , guarantees them a decent living and prevents the ongoing desertification of rural areas .
<2en> It is not enough , therefore , merely to say that we are promoting solidarity in the energy resources field and promoting broadband in rural areas if we really want to contribute to the recovery of Europe 's economy .
<2en> As we have advocated , what is needed is a thorough revision of Community policies and a substantial increase in budget funding .
<2en> That is why we abstained .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Indeed , we intend to promote communication on sport this summer .
<en> So , we will have the communication before the summer recess .
<en> That should provide the framework for enhanced cooperation , a new agenda for sport at EU level and also a draft decision for a two-year EU sport programme for 2012 and 2013 .
<en> Of course , in the meantime , as you very well know , we have the ongoing sport actions in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 , focusing on grass-root sport and the social aspect of sport .
<en> Actions for 2009 have already been approved and they are to be enforced this year .
<en> We are about to approve the action for 2010 , which will also be ready in a couple of months .
<en> Of course , as you very well know , unfortunately , the budget for 2010 has been cut from EUR 6 million to EUR 3 million .
<en> According to the budget that we have for 2011 , we have new actions and new testing material in order to formulate our programme for 2012 and 2013 .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Vassiliou , I would like to express enormous thanks for the declaration concerning the establishment of a new agenda for sport , but I would also like to present a certain idea related to this , which the Committee on Culture and Education is also talking about .
<en> It is related to the new key competences , to which can also be added , today , abilities in sport , knowledge of culture and knowledge about the European Union .
<en> Mrs Vassiliou , do you anticipate joining in the discussion on the new and very important aspect of key skills for young people throughout the European Union , so that the questions of sport , knowledge about the European Union and knowledge about culture , which are so important for building a European identity , will also be emphasised and accentuated ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Certainly , when I speak about the societal role of sport , matters concerning education and training are very important , and I think that education is even more important for our common European identity .
<en> This will certainly be taken into account when we formulate our more permanent programme on sport .
<en> Subject : Road deaths
<en> Could the Commission please outline how it intends to combat the three main causes of road deaths : speed , drug / drink driving and inadequate road infrastructure ?
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - Within the framework of the third European Action Programme on Road Safety up to 2010 , a number of actions were implemented to combat speeding , drug and drink driving as well as to improve road infrastructure .
<en> Many of those actions have involved the European Parliament under the codecision procedure .
<en> But , of course , further efforts are needed .
<en> The Commission is currently working on the European Road Safety Strategy for the next decade .
<en> It will stress the importance of proper enforcement and sanctions for dangerous behaviour , in particular , drink driving and excessive speed .
<en> Citizens of Member States cannot understand why other EU nationals are not sanctioned when they violate the law .
<en> For this reason , it is urgent to resume discussions on the proposals for a directive on cross-border enforcement , which received the full support of the European Parliament , but was blocked by the Council .
<en> The Commission is determined to move forward with this proposal .
<en> Besides control and sanctions , education and awareness are areas to which the Commission will give strong emphasis .
<en> Specific actions should be proposed regarding alcohol and speed , such as alcohol locks in certain vehicles or more stringent requirements for novice drivers .
<en> Drug driving is an increasing problem .
<en> The Commission expects the ongoing DRUID research project to provide ideas for concrete action .
<en> As far as infrastructure is concerned , the European Parliament and the Council have adopted legislation regarding safe management and safety requirements for roads and tunnels of the trans-European network .
<en> The Commission , of course , will closely follow their proper implementation by the Member States .
<en> But safety of road infrastructure is not limited to the major TEN roads ; 56 % of road deaths occur on rural roads .
<en> So the Commission will therefore examine the extension of current legislation on safe management to the secondary road network of Member States .
<en> Finally , the Commission will also verify that infrastructure projects receiving EU funding or loans take road safety requirements into account .
<en> I must also underline that road safety is a shared responsibility between the EU institutions , Member States , local and regional bodies , associations and , of course , citizens .
<en> To reach maximum efficiency , solutions must respond to concrete problems on the ground .
<en> The next European Road Safety Strategy will propose a number of actions based on this principle .
<en> Its main goal is to establish a common European road safety area which will form part of a single European transport area where all EU citizens will benefit from the same level of safety all over Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( GA ) Mr President , I would also like to express my thanks to the Commissioner .
<en> Listening to the Commissioner , it is clear that a lot of work has been done in relation to the involvement of speed and alcohol in causing road accidents .
<en> However , it is clear that we are not researching the effect of drugs in these cases .
<en> Driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a major cause of almost 25 % of road accidents in the European Union every year .
<en> 10 000 people die every year as a result of these accidents .
<en> We most do more in relation to drugs , however , as it is clear that they are a major cause of road accidents and of deaths of people on the roads .
<en> I propose to the Commissioner that we must do a lot more .
<en> I welcome the research but we must do a lot more with regard to making it effective .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( ET ) Madam President , Baroness Ashton , as well as the considerable changes in the natural environment , we must also keep in mind the fact that the thawing of the Arctic Ocean , which has accelerated , has opened up the possibility of a race for new natural resources .
<en> This could , however , give rise to a potential security threat to relations between the European Union and other countries .
<en> For this reason , I would like to draw your attention to the behaviour of Russia , which is not about fishing , tourism or mineral ores , but about the world 's last untouched gas and oil supplies .
<en> Despite the idea arising from the European Commission 's Arctic Strategy to engage in cooperation with neighbouring countries in matters concerning adjacent territories , since the turn of the millennium , Russia has not shown any willingness to consider our wishes .
<en> Last year 's Russian national security strategy sent a threatening signal westwards that , if necessary , Russia is prepared to use military force to obtain new resources in the Arctic .
<en> I believe that we should implement targeted policies towards Russia in order to avoid a competitive race .
<sp>
<en> ( ET ) Madam President , Baroness Ashton , thank you for immediately dealing with this most important subject during the start of your stressful term of office .
<en> Most urgent in my view is the Arctic .
<en> You said very directly that the Arctic is not the Antarctic , and that it would be unrealistic to copy the agreement on Antarctica for the Arctic Sea .
<en> I believe that if someone somewhere in the world is to stand for idealism , then it should definitely be the European Commission .
<en> And why should the European Commission not present an idealistic proposal to its partners that , before we start a new gold rush in the Arctic Sea , we should apply a moratorium for several decades - that we do not start a process which will create the possibility of an arms race and other threats ?
<en> I want to say a few words about the rights of the indigenous people of the Arctic .
<en> I believe that , in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on human rights , the question should be asked of whether the indigenous Arctic people living in the Russian Federation get enough involvement in the work of the Arctic Council .
<en> Yes , Antarctica is not the Arctic , but steps which helped to bring about a settlement in the south during the Cold War should not be repeated simply because there is no idealism in the Commission .
<en> I am a native of the country from which the Antarctic explorer Bellingshausen set out .
<en> He went and he discovered things , because he was an idealist .
<en> I wish you some idealism in your work .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , the European Union wants a comprehensive Arctic policy .
<en> This proposition is entirely bizarre .
<en> Cyprus and Greece , for example , have historic cultures , but look at the geography .
<en> It is really rather hard to understand why a country on the Aegean Sea needs there to be an EU policy on the Arctic .
<en> But an EU Arctic policy is perhaps not so bizarre as the appointment of the supremely unqualified Baroness Ashton , the Sarah Palin of the ex-student Left , as High Representative .
<en> At the hearings , it was clear that the High Representative has forgotten nothing and has learnt nothing .
<en> And , by the way ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> I am sorry but I do not think we should listen to personal comments like that in this Chamber .
<en> ( Interjection from the floor )
<en> Your speaking time has finished .
<en> We will not have personal comments of that nature .
<en> ( Interjection from the floor )
<en> We shall now move to the next speaker .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Madam President , let us get back to the point .
<en> As many of our fellow Members have said , the race is on for the natural resources and administration of the Arctic region .
<en> The Arctic region , however , needs a comprehensive approach , as the High Representative said here .
<en> It will have to take account of the extremely fragile nature of Arctic wildlife , the longterm effect of melting ice , and , more than anything , the rights of the region 's indigenous peoples and of the other people who live there .
<en> So far , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its Fish Stocks Agreement have been enough to regulate the extraction of natural resources in the Arctic sea area and on the seabed .
<en> The Arctic Council has concentrated on environmental and research cooperation , but the agreements that focus on the use of natural resources have brought with them a growing need to develop international administration strategies , and the EU , too , may have a role to play here .
<en> Furthermore , the EU 's Arctic policy needs its own strategy , and it should be jointly coordinated .
<en> An appropriate way for the EU to be involved in the Arctic would be to establish an Arctic Centre .
<en> The first time this need for an EU Arctic Information Centre was mentioned was in the Commission 's Communication on the European Union and the Arctic Region in autumn 2008 .
<en> At the Council 's behest , the Commission began to explore the possibility of establishing such a centre in the European Union .
<en> The Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi , on the Arctic Circle , has indicated its willingness to function as the EU Arctic Information Centre .
<en> Finland does not have any territorial claims with respect to natural resources , so the country , as a neutral actor , would be a suitable choice for running the Centre , as Mrs Wallis has also encouragingly stated .
<en> I would therefore urge High Representative Ashton to make a decision on the form an EU Arctic Centre should take , its location and its tasks , thus raising the EU 's profile in Arctic policy .
<en> I wish you a pleasant trip to Lapland .

<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution , since the inclusion of Roma communities is one of the priorities of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament .
<2en> This resolution shows Parliament 's position ahead of the Second European Roma Summit , which is being held on 8 and 9 April in Córdoba under the Spanish Presidency .
<2en> The situation of the Roma population is different from that of other minorities in the EU and their inclusion requires effective policies to curtail the systematic discrimination to which they are subjected .
<2en> All levels of government from the EU to local authorities must be involved and play a role in achieving equal treatment for them , since that is one of the fundamental values of the EU .
<2en> The resolution calls on European institutions to make a coordinated and strategic contribution to including Europe 's Roma population .
<2en> The Córdoba Summit must serve to take a step forward , moving from good intentions to concrete policies that allow the problems faced by these people regarding access to housing , education , public services and employment to be overcome .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am really glad this resolution was adopted ( I obviously voted in favour ) as it includes crucial statements in terms of promoting non-discrimination against the Roma population .
<en> More specifically , it once again calls on the European Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the Second European Roma Summit as I believe that the battle against discrimination directed at the Roma , which is a pan-European community , requires a Community approach .
<2en> We must express our concern regarding the discrimination suffered by Roma in terms of education , housing and employment , as well as equal access to the health care system and other public services .
<2en> We condemn the recent escalation in hostility towards the Roma ( Romaphobia ) in a number of EU Member States , regularly displayed in the form of hate speeches and attacks against the Roma population .
<2en> We call again on the Commission to adopt a horizontal approach to the Roma issue and to draft additional proposals aimed at implementing a coherent policy at European level on Roma social inclusion .
<2en> With this in mind , we ask the Commission to prepare a European Roma strategy in cooperation with Member States to provide better coordination of and promote the efforts aimed at improving the situation of the Roma population .
<2en> Furthermore , I hope that Member States will use the various instruments currently available more efficiently to combat Roma exclusion , such as allocating a maximum of 2 % of ERDF resources to be used for housing for marginalised communities or the existing options as part of the ESF .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We are obviously in favour of Frontex exercising surveillance beyond the territorial waters of border EU states .
<en> There is contradictory legal advice about whether or not it already has such power .
<en> However , this resolution imposed rules and guidelines that would impede this function .
<en> In particular , they insisted not only that Frontex should rescue illegal migrants thought to be in danger at sea ( a self-evidently moral action to take ) but also to impose a duty to grant the rescued illegal immigrants asylum .
<en> We believe that such rescued illegal immigrants should be taken to the country from which they are believed to have embarked or their home country and left there .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution for reasons which go beyond the draft decision and the content of the Council proposal on supplementing the Borders Code as regards the surveillance of the sea external borders .
<2en> Despite the fact that , especially in the second part which is not binding on the Member States , the decision refers to positive elements for defending human rights , the procedure being used to seek its ratification clearly circumvents the work and competences of the European Parliament .
<2en> In this draft decision , the Council exceeds its executive powers .
<2en> If the European Parliament accepts such a procedure , it will create a very negative precedent for its role and effective operation , whereas it should safeguard its control , law-making and other powers as the only elected institution at European level .
<2en> Recently , moreover , we saw that the decisive vote by the European Parliament overturned the agreement on the transfer of personal data on European citizens to the secret services and government of the USA .
<2en> Facilities such as this should not be set in motion .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon has given Parliament new responsibilities .
<2en> This situation means additional administrative work , with the result that Members need qualified staff to act as advisors .
<2en> This new situation leads to two problems : increased costs arising from the need for more assistants , and additional space required in order for them to carry out their duties in good working conditions .
<2en> This situation leads to increased costs .
<2en> That is difficult to explain during this time of crisis , but if Parliament 's work is to be excellent , it needs to have the necessary financial and human resources .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this important report .
<en> The guidelines are the first step in the budget procedure , giving general guidance to the Secretary-General and the Bureau of the European Parliament for the subsequent step , the preliminary draft estimates , which are currently already before the Bureau .
<sp>
<2en> The circumstances under which the 2011 budget is being adopted are exceptional and constitute a challenge at the same time .
<2en> The successful implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon is a greater priority , while the effects of the economic crisis , which are making themselves felt in the European Union , make achieving this objective even more demanding .
<2en> In this context , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , to which I belong , continues to advocate a sustainable and rigorous budget , in which each item of expenditure is justified and in which the rigour and efficiency can be sustainably assured .
<2en> I therefore advocate a move towards a zero-based budget , which allows efficiency and savings .
<2en> In order to better achieve this objective , it is urgent that a long-term building policy be set .
<2en> I agree that it is necessary to promote greater cooperation and strong dialogue at interinstitutional level in order for resources to be better used in various areas , such as translation and building policy , amongst others .
<2en> I would stress the importance of making Parliament 's legislative excellence a priority and providing this House with the means necessary to successfully carry out its legislative role .
<2en> That is why I voted for the 2011 budget guidelines included in this report ...
<2en> ( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report on the EU agricultural product quality policy because to me , it seems extremely relevant in two areas .
<2en> Firstly , it stresses the importance for the European Union to protect the quality of products and makes this a major priority of the European agricultural strategy .
<2en> Secondly , it defends the principle of geographical identification and traditional specialities , presenting them as two elements contributing to European agricultural competitiveness and the preservation of cultural heritage .
<2en> Ultimately , this report gives its support to the agricultural products of which we are so proud while , at the same time , advocating necessary administrative simplifications as regards their protection .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report entitled ' Agricultural product quality policy : what strategy to follow ? ' because quality is a decisive factor in the competitiveness of European products in international markets .
<2en> In this context , I consider the implementation of compulsory ' place of farming ' labelling positive , as it makes it possible to provide consumers with information relating to quality standards .
<2en> I also consider how the report deals with environmental protection and animal welfare to be positive .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - I do not agree .
<en> We are not there .
<en> In fact , as you know , the creation of the institutional position of High Representative / Vice-President of the Commission is one of the most important innovations of the Lisbon Treaty and the idea is to put together what typically we call intergovernmental competences and Community competences .
<en> For the common foreign and security policy , it will remain basically intergovernmental : it is the prerogative of the Member States .
<en> But there are other Community competences that should not go now to the intergovernmental arm .
<en> It should be kept , of course , in the Community method .
<en> So the High Representative / Vice-President of the Commission is , as we say , usually double-hatted .
<en> She will have to put together , using the best of the synergies , those two competences .
<en> So there will be , of course , competences that she will be able to develop inside the Commission , as Vice-President of the Commission , but working also hand-in-hand with the Member States and with the Council .
<en> I think that is the contribution to have more coherent and consistent external relations of the European Union , to reinforce the defence of our interests and promote our values in the world .
<sp>
<en> I can see the internal consistency of what you are saying as a Euro-integrationalist , which I am not .
<en> But , in fact , what you are suggesting is that we should actually go beyond the Lisbon Treaty , which is bad enough , and almost cut out the Council which , as I say , for all its faults , at least contains representatives of nation states .
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - I could never suggest that the Commission go against the treaties , because it is its duty to ensure that the treaties are respected .
<en> What I am really asking Member States to do is to respect the treaty , and all the institutions have to respect the treaty .
<en> The treaty strikes a balance and that balance has to be respected .
<en> It represents progress compared to the past , where we had completely different institutions to deal with what is , in fact , a very important common interest - namely the defence of European values in the world .
<en> I consider it possible , in full respect of the treaty , to achieve exactly what the treaty aims to achieve .
<en> That can be done in a spirit of good cooperation between all institutions and in full respect , of course , of our Member States .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I come from the south of Italy and in our region , the economy is based on small and medium-sized enterprises , on the textile , clothing and footwear manufacturing industries , and on agriculture .
<en> Today , this type of industry is in serious difficulty because of the influx of goods from China and the Asian markets .
<en> To produce a shoe in our region , in southern Italy , costs EUR 13 .
<en> The cost of the finished product from China is EUR 5.50 .
<en> A baby grow produced by us costs EUR 4-5 , whereas one from China costs EUR 1 .
<en> Entrepreneurs are relocating in order to survive or are closing down , and when they close down , thousands of jobs are lost , and this also causes a consumption crisis and an impoverishment of the region .
<en> Whenever I meet entrepreneurs , they ask me : ' What is stopping you from imposing customs duties , from imposing taxes ? '
<en> For in China , there is low-cost production because children from the age of 12 work 10 hours a day with no social security benefits , no insurance and no health care rights .
<en> I know that protectionist measures are undesirable , but what is the answer ?
<en> Mr Barroso , when I meet entrepreneurs , what do I tell them that Europe is doing to combat an irreversible crisis in which so many businesses are failing , so many jobs are going up in smoke and entire regions of Europe , including the poorest regions , the south of Italy , are going through a serious and irreversible crisis ?
<en> I would like to be able to offer some answers , Mr Barroso , and I would like to hear them from you .
<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - I understand your concern and it is a very legitimate concern , and I would like to say a word about the small and medium-sized companies , which in fact are , as you know , the most important driver for job creation in Europe .
<en> Now , how can you respond to this problem of competition coming from other parts of the world which have lower standards , both in labour and in environment ?
<en> I think the solution is certainly not to close our borders , because the European Union is by far the biggest exporter in the world .
<en> So the solution is to promote decent work and upgrading of social standards all over the world .
<en> That is a matter which we have been pushing inside the G20 ; that is a matter that we have been pushing with the International Labour Organisation , and that is a part of our dialogue with other partners .
<en> But I really think it is not a solution - unless there is dumping - to act via anti-dumping instruments , nor is it a solution to close our borders to other very important trade partners of Europe .
<en> That will be self-defeating for us .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , Mr López Garrido , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on Passenger Name Record ( PNR ) data is very similar to the one we have just held on SWIFT .
<en> Basically , we are talking about the quest for a healthy , acceptable balance between security and the protection of privacy .
<en> Both are important , of course , and a careful balance needs to be struck between them .
<en> The problems in European aviation over recent days have demonstrated once more the essential role played by passenger and freight transport in the organisation of today 's society .
<en> Just about everyone will travel by air sooner or later .
<en> Therefore , it is unacceptable for us to have dozens of items of data continually transferred and updated , often completely unwittingly , without there being cast-iron guarantees to prevent abuse ; particularly as , for example , the US authorities already use a wide variety of information sources for a very long time to assess whether or not a person is suspicious , ranging from his or her visa application to check-in procedures at the airport .
<en> A few weeks ago , I was able to see for myself in the PNR centre in Washington how a whole team is working round the clock to reduce an initial rough list of approximately 5 000 people each day to a small list of a handful of people to be denied access to US territory .
<en> Evidently , only an administrative appeal is possible against such a ban on entering US territory .
<en> It is clear that this flow of data must remain confined within certain limits and that the minimum conditions set out in the resolution must be laid down , such as restricting the use of this data to the detection of terrorism and international crime .
<en> I agree with my fellow Members who have said that this must indeed be well defined , that all of this must , of course , be in keeping with the European data protection standards , and that this also applies when transferring data to further third countries where applicable .
<en> In my opinion , we also need to provide rather more clarity regarding the ' sensitive ' PNR data , as I believe quite a few things are open to interpretation in this regard .
<en> Therefore , I support the proposed postponement , so as to enable a new negotiating mandate to be presented , sooner rather than later , that takes account of our questions .
<en> I take note of the constructive position of the Council and the Commission and , like my fellow Members , expect to see more clarity by the summer months .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) The tension has indeed eased a little , ladies and gentlemen .
<en> Mrs in ' t Veld has drawn up a splendid resolution , one that is embraced by the Commission and the Council .
<en> That is excellent in itself , and I agree with her : I think it very prudent to state at this juncture that we are drawing up a single clear guideline for all future Passenger Name Record ( PNR ) agreements that takes account of proportionality , which means transferring only the data truly and strictly necessary for the intended purpose , namely combating terrorism , and to make clear that this is the one and only objective .
<en> This guideline must also make provision for reciprocity and provide that data cannot be stored for years to come , that time limits are indeed set , and that we stand by our fundamental rights .
<en> The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has now been declared binding , and so that , too , will have to be reflected in such PNR agreements .
<en> Therefore , it strikes me as the right time to submit this to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna , and I should like to ask this of the Commission .
<en> There is one other thing we should take into account , which is that it has now become customary for citizens to communicate with a foreign state - in this case , often the United States - via an enterprise , namely an airline , that has nothing to do with it , should not actually need certain of my details , and should not be trying to play this mediating role .
<en> Something needs to be done about this .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , freedom over the clouds , as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang , will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record ( PNR ) data .
<en> In August , a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having .
<en> Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists , the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space .
<en> As we all know in this House , this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding .
<en> Today , US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data - credit card numbers , booking data , seating preferences , special food preferences , IP addresses and passenger information - without clear data protection regulations .
<en> I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that , as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying , referred to as PNR , as it now is to be developed .
<en> We cannot support it as it is currently formulated , because it is not for a specific purpose , and it is not proportionate or useful .
<en> Finally , I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour .
<en> We need disclosure regulations like the USA 's privacy act .
<en> These must be opened to European citizens .
<en> The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , Mr López Garrido , I too would firstly like to make a short comparison with the SWIFT debate .
<en> I was quite delighted to hear the representative of the Council talk of dedicated objectives in negotiations for this new SWIFT agreement .
<en> I am therefore quite surprised by the sort of effect and power the Treaty of Lisbon and the statement by Parliament have had on the Council , which now wants to champion the interests of Europe .
<en> I hope that we experience the same momentum now when we are talking about Passenger Name Record data , and that here there is also a commitment to fighting on behalf of European interests .
<en> Secondly , I would like to say that I believe we all agree that from the point of view of legal certainty for both airlines and citizens , when it is a question of data protection rights , such agreements make sense .
<en> The standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution .
<en> Thirdly , I would like to mention a point that is not directly connected with the agreements , but definitely relates to the subject , in other words , the debate in the Council as to whether we also need or should develop a European PNR system .
<en> The last major terror threat in Europe was the Detroit case when an attacker boarded a plane and wanted to fly to Detroit .
<en> That happened last year before Christmas .
<en> In this case , we learned that in the United Kingdom , we knew that this person was a threat .
<en> However , those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand .
<en> What I want to say here is that I believe that in the European Union , the problem is not whether there is enough data available .
<en> I believe that we already know who poses a threat .
<en> The problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats .
<en> In Toledo , the Spanish Presidency proposed - and I am grateful for this - that we strengthen the networking of counter terrorism authorities in Europe .
<en> Unfortunately , this proposal was not taken up by the European interior ministers .
<en> Instead , there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data .
<en> It often seems to me that for the interior ministers , collecting new data is the easy option .
<en> I would firstly ask you to attend to the networking of the authorities involved ; then we would achieve a lot in the fight against terror .
<sp>
<en> ( SL ) I firmly believe that all Members of the European Parliament are aware of the importance of timely and accurate information in ensuring the safety of their many journeys .
<en> Today , as we face air traffic chaos , the scale of the daily movement of passengers is much more obvious to us all .
<en> Unfortunately , the financial losses of many airlines bear a rather obvious testament to that because of the missed flights and the crowds that have been and are still waiting for a seat on the first available flight .
<en> I hope now that we will soon be able to fly safely again .
<en> Any passenger who travels by aeroplane discloses their data explicitly only to the authorities responsible for combating terrorism and organised crime .
<en> I have no quarrel with that .
<en> If I voluntarily post details of when and where I am travelling on Twitter , then I do not mind such information being used in ensuring day-to-day air traffic security .
<en> What I do object to , however , is the fact that PNR agreements do not set predetermined conditions and criteria for all countries equally , that they do not specify the data we need to disclose and that we do not know the exact purposes for which such data will be used by the authorities .
<en> My question to you is as follows : can we expect to be given a mandate to negotiate a new agreement on the transfer of data records before or during the summer ?
<en> Furthermore , will all agreements between the European Union and individual countries that wish to enter into them be model agreements and agreements with equal , high and clear standards for the use and protection of data ?
<en> What action will you take to prevent PNR data being used in the profiling and definition of risk factors ?
<en> The point I wish to make is that any possibility of allowing personality profiling based on ethnic origin , nationality , religion , sexual orientation , sex , age or health is unacceptable .
<en> To this , I would like to add that no data collection system is sufficient in itself .
<en> We cannot prevent attempted terrorist attacks without sound data exchange and cooperation of the intelligence services .
<en> A very good reminder of that was the failed attack on the aeroplane flying to Detroit around Christmas last year .
<en> What we need , above all , is to use efficiently the instruments we already have in the fight against terrorism and , in particular , better cooperation .
<en> To conclude , I definitely do not want to say ' no ' to an agreement that would offer security to us all , citizens of the EU .
<en> Still less do I want to see our fundamental privacy rights being violated .
<en> However , it is right that any intrusion into our privacy should be balanced with security and efficiency of measures and with the protection of human rights .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report emphasises the importance that the new common agricultural policy will have for all Member States .
<2en> The safeguarding of areas with natural handicaps will be one of the main points of this policy that the EU and the regions of the Member States will be implementing , thereby putting subsidiarity into effect in practical terms .
<2en> The EU Commission must take this subsidiarity into account , especially when it comes to identifying the parameters that will define these areas .
<2en> The Commission must not neglect the fact that the recovery of areas with natural handicaps will provide tangible help for farms affected by the current major crisis , and will help to keep the environment in good condition .
<2en> May I remind you that all this must be possible not just in theory , but also in reality , through the allocation of appropriate funds for safeguarding and redeveloping these areas .
<2en> In doing this , we could recover and provide incentives for the economic development of agriculture in all areas with potential for growth and determine knock-on effects in the market , such as the agricultural production of foodstuffs typical of the area , and safeguarding of the landscape and the environment .
<2en> I thank Mr Dorfmann and congratulate him on his excellent report .
<sp>
<2en> In order to achieve fair and uniform conditions for all farmers in the European Union , which should , unquestionably , be the main objective of reform of the common agricultural policy , care should also be taken over areas with natural handicaps .
<2en> In order to harmonise the legislation which classifies areas as eligible to receive payments it is essential , above all , to harmonise the classification criteria of such areas .
<2en> Achieving this objective will not be possible without close cooperation with Member States .
<2en> The pragmatism proposed by the author of the report in allowing biophysical criteria to be defined by individual countries may pose a threat in the form of attempts to impose particular national interests .
<2en> However , as long as the Commission takes care to ensure that European legislative framework provisions are observed , this solution should significantly improve objective identification of the areas under discussion .
<sp>
<2en> Considering that more than half of the utilised agricultural area in the EU ( 54 % ) is classed as less-favoured areas - whether because of orography , climatic conditions or less fertile land - and that such a measure is essential to rural development , we conclude that aid for less-favoured areas must constitute a priority for the Member States .
<2en> For this reason , the preparation of a comprehensive strategy for less-favoured areas that meets the local needs of the various regions will lead to a reduction in the existing disparity between Member States as regards the aid that is awarded to them .
<2en> Therefore , by exactly defining the areas with natural handicaps , it will be possible to obtain sufficient funds to make use of the land and improve agricultural output .
<sp>
<2en> There is no doubt that farms in the outermost regions are in particular need of financial support .
<2en> Small mountain farms often have to fight to survive , as it is scarcely possible for them to react quickly to new market requirements .
<2en> Smallholders in particular lack the staff to be able to remain competitive .
<2en> Consequently , from a business point of view alone , their situation is much more difficult than that of large agricultural undertakings in exposed locations .
<2en> The high rate of farms going under in the past few years and the increase in part-time farmers clearly show that the EU subsidy policy focuses far too heavily on intensive livestock farming and the like .
<2en> In order for the EU Member States to remain even remotely self-sufficient , it is high time we renationalised our farming subsidies .
<2en> With a view to a fairer distribution of compensation payments , I have voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report , which tackles the problems facing farmers in many EU Member States .
<2en> I would like to emphasise in particular the importance of an amendment which I tabled in committee , and I wish to thank my colleagues who supported it .
<2en> The aim of the amendment I am alluding to is to ensure that the way in which areas with natural handicaps are delimited is relevant by basing it on homogeneous ecological zones rather than on LAU 2 , as is the case at the moment .
<2en> I also wish to point out that I feel that it is appropriate to include in the Commission 's future proposal flexible rules which also allow aid to be granted to farmers in zones with natural handicaps with a small area , located from an administrative perspective in units which do not meet the established criteria .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Consolidation of the biregional strategic partnership between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean , signed in 1999 , must be a priority on the European Union 's foreign policy agenda .
<2en> Although significant progress has been made during the last 10 years in terms of developing EU-Latin American bilateral relations , further steps still need to be taken .
<2en> The partnership 's ultimate objective is to create in 2015 a Euro-Latin American global interregional cooperation zone in the areas of politics , economics , trade , and social and cultural affairs , thereby ensuring sustainable development in both regions .
<2en> Today 's vote means that the European Parliament supports the adoption in future of a Euro-Latin American Charter for Peace and Security which will include , based on the UN Charter and related international legislation , strategies and guidelines on political actions and common security .
<2en> I also think that the fight against climate change , which hits the poorest population in the world hardest , must become a key component in the EU-Latin American strategy .
<2en> Both sides must make significant efforts to reach a common negotiating position as part of the discussions leading up to the UN Conference on climate change , which will be held at the end of the year in Mexico .
<sp>
<2en> The own-initiative report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America incorporates the approach that the EU promotes within international relations .
<2en> Indeed , this text reconciles economic , social , political and institutional dimensions in order to ensure that trade between the two geographical areas also benefits the most disadvantaged populations and contributes to the sustainable development of the subcontinent .
<2en> Moreover , the report recommends the harmonisation of financial regulations to introduce greater responsibility on the issue at global level .
<2en> I therefore clearly voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<2en> The resolution adopted today during the European Parliament plenary is an important sign indicating that the EU is very well aware of its global role .
<2en> Latin America is the favourite tourist destination of many Europeans , but it means much more than this to Europe .
<2en> Latin America may fall short in the area of democracy , judging by European standards and principles .
<2en> The European Parliament recently debated a resolution concerning blatant human rights violations in Cuba .
<2en> The situation ended in the death of people who were exercising their right to free expression .
<2en> These are tragic situations which must never happen again .
<2en> However , the European Union 's experience indicates that a relationship built over time , based on friendship and diplomacy , is much more productive in the long term .
<2en> A constructive approach will allow the European Union to successfully become an exporter of democratic principles , as it wishes to be .
<2en> Latin America is a huge continent , which cannot be ignored from an economic or social perspective .
<2en> In fact , the European Investment Bank has already been operating in the South American continent for a long time , offering the opportunity for long-term investments , which is a noteworthy sign in itself .
<2en> The resolution adopted today is part of a clear mandate given to the EU High Representative on how to approach relations with Latin America .
<sp>
<2en> I support the message conveyed in the resolution on improving the coordination of the positions of countries on both continents with regard to the methods for implementing the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , especially as the MDG Summit is going to be held this September .
<2en> We need to establish common ground , all the more so as we are behind in achieving the targets proposed for 2015 , particularly for combating poverty .
<2en> Especially at a time of global recession , investments need to be focused on poorer countries and on the more vulnerable population groups so that they can benefit from new jobs and the conditions required for social integration .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America , which argues for the creation of a full biregional strategic partnership .
<2en> I would stress the importance of the recommendation to reconcile the positions of the two regional blocs regarding the negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .

<en> The last item is the report by Mr Cozzolino , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the protection of the Communities ' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Annual report 2008 .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans , the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial .
<2en> Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort .
<2en> The work was confined , first and foremost , to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors , whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008 .
<2en> The fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds .
<2en> Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too .
<2en> However , absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control .
<2en> Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements .
<2en> Firstly , the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities , and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud , waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes .
<2en> Secondly , the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States , with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens .
<2en> In order to achieve these objectives , we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities : firstly , we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles , analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources , with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects .
<2en> Secondly , reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations .
<2en> We are embarking on a legislative and regulatory simplification programme , intended in particular for the Structural Funds .
<2en> Moreover , the fight against corruption , financial crime and breaches of public procurement rules must be stepped up .
<2en> In this year 's report we have made progress on this point with the support of the entire committee .
<2en> Thanks to an intense , concerted effort , proposals have been drafted on the main problems in this area .
<2en> From the relationship between the EU and tax havens , to the databases on beneficiaries of European funds , the report makes a practical contribution to increasing the transparency of expenditure and to strengthening the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies .
<2en> Lastly , with regard to OLAF , it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence , the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy , which it most definitely needs .
<2en> We must keep the debate alive and kicking in Europe so as to establish the role of a single European Prosecutor .
<2en> To conclude , I believe it is vitally important to fight together for the transparent and efficient management of European resources .
<2en> In this regard we must ensure that the problems that do exist are not exploited in any way in order to call into question instruments of fundamental importance to the European project , such as cohesion policy and development aid .
<2en> Rather , we must look clearly at the problems , at the distortions that still exist in the various European spending areas and use these data to take new , determined steps forward , thereby making the management of our finances more efficient and transparent .
<2en> I believe that , by making this effort , the various European institutions really will make progress in the construction of a Europe that is stronger , more integrated and able to better satisfy the needs of Europeans .
<sp>
<en> - ( RO ) I think that European funds must be made accessible to citizens in a fair , transparent manner .
<en> One feasible method for possibly eradicating corruption in public procurement is to introduce a transparent system in the form of an online tender system .
<en> According to the Commission 's report , the declining financial impact of irregularities in 2008 indicates that some of the legislative and institutional measures aimed at discouraging fraud were implemented successfully by Member States .
<en> Greater financial control is still required , along with effective legislation for combating tax fraud , especially relating to VAT .
<en> The protection of the European Union 's financial interests is a priority for the Romanian Government as well .
<en> As part of this , the Fight Against Fraud Department was set up .
<en> It provides the single point of contact in Romania with OLAF for European funds .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , as EPP shadow rapporteur I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the other colleagues from the political groups for their excellent cooperation .
<en> We paid particular attention to increasing transparency and better rules for public procurement , as this is the area most vulnerable to fraud and corruption which distort the market and increase the prices paid by consumers .
<en> Moreover , beneficiaries of EU funds from all Member States should be published on one website and based on the same criteria .
<en> I also called for the mutual recognition of disqualifications , such as the exclusion of fraudulent offenders from acting as chief executives .
<en> OLAF 's activities should be supported ; we ask for statistics and reasons in cases where national authorities did not file indictments following reports by OLAF , which happens in 73 % of the cases initiated by OLAF .
<en> The report also proposes to ban companies which operate through offshore havens from concluding business agreements with companies residing in the Union if their offshore location has unilaterally delayed the adoption of cooperation agreements with the Union .
<en> Let me conclude by saying that the Union must treat fraud and corruption as interlinked and as a matter of priority .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I think it is not an exaggeration to say that the current economic crisis was brought about by a moderate crisis initially , a moderate crisis that saw greed triumph over generosity , corruption triumph over integrity and self-interest triumph over solidarity ; and until we get back to generosity , integrity and solidarity being at the heart of corporate and government affairs we will never get out of the trouble we are in at the minute .
<en> I agree totally with every effort made to fight fraud .
<en> I have seen programmes in Ireland showing people who were claiming social welfare in the Republic of Ireland , Northern Ireland and England every week , people flying in to Cork airport and out again having claimed social welfare .
<en> The worst of all was the banks - Allied Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide - playing ping-pong with accounting practices to hide their true situation .
<en> This has landed us in terrible trouble in Ireland , and every effort must go to ensure that fraud is stopped .
<en> The message has to go out loud and clear that it is going to be pursued and dealt with very strongly at European level and at every level .

<2en> I voted for the draft directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation .
<2en> The directive covers every stage in the chain , from donation to transplantation , and provides for cooperation between Member States .
<2en> An effective transplantation system is not solely based on donors ' support ; it also depends on the correct use of information and on the quality of the network by which this information is shared .
<2en> I therefore supported the idea of creating a European database recording information on the organs available , and a pan-European certification system guaranteeing that the human organs and tissues available have been obtained legally .
<2en> Indeed , in order to ensure equal access to available organs , organs must only be donated on a voluntary basis , without any payments being made .
<2en> However , the principle of not paying for organs will not prevent live donors from being compensated , provided that such compensation is strictly limited to covering the costs and loss of income resulting from the donation .
<2en> Such a transparent , safe and efficient donation system is the only way to combat organ trafficking .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the proposal for a directive for the following reasons : 1 .
<2en> Given the increase in the demand for organs for transplant and the limited supply , which often forces patients to look for solutions to their problem beyond national borders , the adoption at Community level of a common framework of quality and safety standards and the creation of a network of cooperation and mutual information is absolutely necessary in order to improve protection for public health and services to patients .
<2en> 2 .
<2en> National provisions governing the procedure for providing consent to organ donation , the selection of which remains within the jurisdiction of the Member States , are not affected in any way .
<2en> On the contrary , the proposal for a directive supplements the current legal framework of each Member State of the EU with specific quality and safety standards throughout the transplantation procedure and , at the same time , safeguards the absence of any form of speculation and maintains the anonymity and security of both the donor 's and the recipient 's personal data .
<2en> 3 .
<2en> Cases of organ smuggling are minimised and the confidence of potential donors is strengthened , with the ultimate aim of increasing the number of donors .
<2en> 4 .
<2en> Sanctions are imposed by the Member States in the event of infringement of legislation relating to the identity of donors or recipients .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the report on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation because it contributes to reducing operation waiting lists for European sufferers .
<2en> It is unacceptable that , on average , 12 people awaiting a transplant die every day .
<2en> This directive will make it easier to donate and transplant organs , and to exchange them between EU Member States , benefiting thousands of ill Europeans .
<sp>
<2en> The scarcity of organs for transplantation has been feeding a terrible market which affects , above all , developing countries , but which has also hit deprived people in Eastern Europe .
<2en> I share the concern about the difficulty of combating this brutal trade and the terrible consequences for those who are deprived , forcibly or not , of their organs : savage drops in quality of life , chronic illnesses and , in many cases , death .
<2en> The adoption of common rules puts the European Union on a level footing in terms of requirements and responsibilities , in stark contrast with the sombre situation that I have described .
<2en> Patients and donors will have the conditions , the monitoring and the protection that those involved in the trafficking networks lack , and the Member States will start to be able to cooperate effectively .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that donation must be altruistic , voluntary and free , and that the donor must only be compensated for any expenses or inconvenience incurred by the donation .
<2en> I believe that my colleague , Mr Mikolášik , has proposed some good alterations that improve the basic text ; they must be a result of his medical training and of his following this subject since the last parliamentary session .
<sp>
<2en> I warmly welcome this proposal and its three principal objectives : guaranteeing quality and security for patients at Union level , ensuring the protection of donors and facilitating cooperation between Member States .
<2en> In general in the EU , there is a broad social consensus on the donation of organs for transplantation .
<2en> However , due to differences of culture and tradition , and also in the system of organisation , there are different approaches to this issue within the Member States .
<2en> I would stress that although the directive is aimed at maintaining or attempting to achieve harmonisation between quality and security measures , it should not create an extra administrative burden for Member States .
<2en> Rather , it should have a sufficient margin of flexibility for it not to jeopardise good practice already in force .
<2en> The proposal for a directive establishes common , binding standards of quality and safety for organs of human origin to be transplanted with the aim of guaranteeing a high level of protection for health throughout the EU .
<2en> I endorse the Commission 's view that , in principle , organ transplantation programmes must comply with the principle of voluntary and free donation .
<2en> Organ donation must always be free and protected from any potential commercialisation .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I was extremely pleased , but not surprised , at the overwhelming vote in favour , which has been consistent throughout the debates on the International Fund for Ireland .
<en> Of course , the EU is one of the main contributors to the IFI 's inception in 1986 , when it was established by the London and Dublin governments to promote economic and social development in the 12 counties on both sides of the border .
<en> ( GA ) More than EUR 800 million in contributions have been paid into the fund , and when the multiplier effect is taken into account , this equates to an investment in excess of EUR 2 billion .
<en> I am from a border county myself and I am a representative of the border region and , as such , I have a very good understanding of the part the International Fund for Ireland played in the peace process .
<en> More than 40 000 direct jobs and 16 000 indirect jobs have been created with the help of the International Fund and it has created employment opportunities in an economically disadvantaged region .
<en> In conclusion , while a sunset strategy has been agreed to take the work of the IFI to the end of this year , I do believe that every consideration should be given to prolonging this worthwhile and effective programme .
<en> Thank you for your indulgence .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I voted for this initiative because its main goal is to continue supporting the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland and Ireland 's border areas , in order to build bridges of reconciliation and communication between the most divided communities and to continue , as Europeans , defending values and human rights .
<en> We in Euskadi - the Basque country - are still suffering from terrorist violence and we are waiting for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna ( ETA ) to hear the cry of Basque society , which is tired of suffering and is asking for it to renounce violence once and for all .
<en> We are awaiting a definitive ceasefire declaration .
<en> Under these circumstances , I expect from the European Union the same solidarity and wholehearted support for Euskadi to build the peace and reconciliation that we are longing for .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , no country has been so disadvantaged by the bail-outs as Ireland , and no people has been so hard done by as the Irish .
<en> The Irish Finance Minister , Brian Lenihan , made all the right decisions .
<en> Every Irish public servant from the Taoiseach to the lowest civil servant , and even the recipients of unemployment benefit , have tightened their belts and taken huge cuts in income .
<en> Now they find that , if they had made none of those painful decisions - if they had just carried on spending - they might have qualified , like the Greeks , for a bail-out of their own and , worse than that , they discover that they are obliged to participate in rescuing Greece .
<en> In fact , not only that , but they discover that in per capita terms , Ireland is making a greater contribution than most of the other eurozone members .
<en> Every orthodox economist would suggest that what we need to do at a time like this is to allow some of the eurozone economies to print their own currencies again , to devalue , to buy themselves time to price themselves back into the market .
<en> Instead , we are condemning the peoples of southern Europe to years of poverty and deflation and loading the taxpayers of northern Europe with an enormous debt , all in order to save a few faces .
<en> Surely we have the most expensive faces since that of Helen of Troy , which launched a thousand ships !
<sp>
<en> Mr President , it was not my intention to make an explanation of vote on this particular issue , but during his speech , the rapporteur referred only to Dr Paisley and Mr Adams , saying that they brought the peace to Northern Ireland .
<en> Well , Mr Adams and Dr Paisley may have brought a lot of things but peace they never brought .
<en> A lot of people may claim peace in Northern Ireland but it was really David Trimble and John Hume who bore the brunt of the heavy lifting to bring the peace to Northern Ireland , and I hope the rapporteur will get his facts right in the future .
<en> They did all the heavy lifting in the past .
<en> Let me make it clear that I voted in favour of this today because I believe that in Northern Ireland today , we still need support to maintain what has been achieved .
<en> It is by no means sure that the peace will last as there are those on both sides - and we have seen them coming forward recently - who are still trying to de-establish what has been achieved .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I was among the 334 Members of the European Parliament who endorsed Pastor Tőkés for the position of Vice-President of the European Parliament .
<en> He is a hero of my younger days .
<en> As a journalist for Solidarity in 1989 and under fire from the criminal Securitate security service of Ceauşescu , I reported on the Romanian revolution , and that revolution started in Timişoara with a speech made by Mr Tőkés on 16 December 1989 .
<en> However , it grieves me that today , he has been the victim , first of a computer error which wrongly counted 168 votes , and that then those 168 votes were added by the person chairing the proceedings to the overall total , which has been the cause of general controversy .
<en> Therefore , if people are going to call into question the legality of Mr Tőkés ' election as Vice-President of the European Parliament , then I am in favour of taking the vote again .
<en> I am certain his result will be even better .
<en> The mandate of such a distinguished person in the European Parliament must not be questioned by anyone .
<en> So I think that it is in the interest of Mr Tőkés himself , if anyone is going to raise doubts , to repeat the vote .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The International Fund for Ireland is a good example of transnational and international cooperation .
<2en> The fund , which is managed by an independent international body , is financed by several countries : the European Union , the United States , Canada , New Zealand and Australia .
<2en> Both in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic , the projects foster contact , dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists .
<2en> This international support will , however , be coming to an end in 2010 .
<2en> We should therefore consider how the fund 's action priorities might be financed after this date , especially those relating to promoting economic and social progress and encouraging the peace dialogue .
<2en> The projects covered by the International Fund for Ireland already complement the actions under the EU PEACE programmes .
<2en> It would be useful to establish what will happen to these projects in the context of the forthcoming EU budget planning .
<2en> I therefore call upon the European Commission to look into how the Structural Funds might continue the role of the International Fund for Ireland , particularly within the framework of the ' European territorial cooperation ' objective .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Following numerous years of instability in Ireland , a fund referred to as the IFI was set up for the purpose of ensuring economic and financial stability in the region .
<en> We have seen that the report looks into the plans for the fund in the future and establishes some key goals that need to be tackled .
<en> I agree with the conclusions reached by the rapporteur and hence decided to vote in favour of this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the Kelly Report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning EU financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( IFI ) .
<en> Such inter-regional cooperation and reconciliation projects should be supported , in particular , with a view to furthering social and economic progress .
<en> The IFI has been a key part of cross-community reconciliation and recognition needs to be given to the key role played by the EU in this area .
<en> Lessons can be learned from the successes of the IFI initiatives , which may be applied to other areas of the Union where there is community marginalisation and tension .
<en> The use of EU funds to support the IFI 's ' Football for Peace ' project is a point that I wish to highlight .
<en> The promotion of reconciliation and mutual understanding amongst young people through the medium of sport is an initiative which should be lauded .
<en> Indeed , the use of sport to empower individuals and combat social exclusion should not be underestimated .
<sp>
<2en> The peace process in Northern Ireland is an example of success that has deserved , and should continue to deserve , the support of the European institutions .
<2en> As with European integration , in post-conflict situations like this one , the path to stability can be forged by establishing de facto solidarities which facilitate and increase cross-border and inter-community relations .
<2en> I hope that other parts of the European Union plagued by the phenomenon of secessionist terrorism can look to the Irish process and learn lessons from it that will allow them to eradicate violence and construct a society in which everyone can feel that they belong , while respecting the law , traditions and human rights .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the extension of the International Fund for Ireland , as I believe that it is important to emphasise the European Union 's mission of peace between peoples and communities as a key factor for economic and social development , as well as for enhancing human dignity and quality of life for citizens .
<2en> This can be seen in the specific case of Ireland .
<2en> The European Union should continue to play a key role in maintaining peace and eliminating regional , ethnic and cultural tension , and thus promoting conditions for social and economic progress .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , we urgently need this review .
<en> It is a few years too late and , because of this delay , the European Commission is , of course , getting caught up by one political reality after another .
<en> These changes which were ushered in by the Treaty of Lisbon must obviously now also be viewed in the light of the financial and economic crisis .
<en> When the Commissioner repeatedly says that we should now set ourselves political goals and priorities , I can tell him what , in my view , our priority should be : it lies in saving , specifically saving on administrative expenditure under heading 5 .
<en> We have a situation where we do not know the exact scale of the European Union 's administrative expenditure .
<en> The administrative expenditure of EU agencies , the decentralised agencies , is not covered by heading 5 .
<en> That brings me on to my question : what are you going to do to ensure that we can finally have transparency in our administrative expenditure ?
<en> What specifically are you going to undertake to ensure that expenditure is dramatically reduced ?
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) In the resolution on the budget for the current year , Parliament approved the possibility of extending the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007-2013 to 2015-2016 .
<en> We are all aware that in seeking to control the deficit and reduce public debt , the Member States are cutting back on investment .
<en> This means that the implementation of EU funds will be further delayed .
<en> However , these resources are vital for social , economic and territorial cohesion .
<en> Are the Commission and the Council therefore willing , like Parliament , to extend the Multiannual Financial Framework to 2015-2016 ?
<en> The challenges posed by globalisation , the ageing population and climate change have to be overcome .
<en> With the implementation of the 2020 strategy , I am sure that we will make the right choice and defend employment , quality of life and our social model .
<en> However , if we are to cope with these investments , how can we increase the European Union 's budget ?
<en> In 2009 , the surplus was more than EUR 2.2 billion .
<en> Are the Commission and the Council willing for these surplus funds from the EU budget to be used to strengthen the following year 's budget or to constitute a fund to finance the EU 's priorities ?
<en> How would they proceed in relation to Parliament concerning the establishment of EU priorities ?
<en> They advocate a clear escalation of EU priorities so that we can decide , in a transparent and consensual manner , what we want to support , in a concrete form and with financial support , and what we are supporting from a strictly political point of view , but will this have any impact on the budget ?
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is a pity that the European budget , which should be a symbol of solidarity and the will to act together , has become a rigid tool , which the citizens do not understand and which lags behind the expectations of European society , incapable of being deployed to fight the social repercussions of the crisis .
<en> From this point of view , not a day passes without the media or a top-ranking politician talking about the need for a stronger European budget .
<en> Tension is increasing between revenue that is too modest , too dependent on the contributions of the Member States , and the money that the Union needs to spend in order to kick-start growth .
<en> For example , in the draft budget for 2011 , the Commission simply presents a margin for manoeuvre of EUR 50 million to support new projects linked to employment and corporate competitiveness , which are top priorities .
<en> The revision of the financial framework is therefore a serious challenge for the future of the Union if we want to make it a real political and economic leader and also , and above all , a player that is closer to its citizens at a time when nearly 25 million of them are affected by unemployment .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , the debate further to Mr Böge 's question has not actually borne a great deal of fruit .
<en> The envisaged mid-term review has failed to materialise and , in addition , what is now being promised is extremely meagre .
<en> Against that background , Parliament too must become involved in steering things .
<en> I should like to make three suggestions .
<en> Firstly , if there is no new money , we must simply reprioritise within the budgets .
<en> We must take a good look at where the big money is to be found within agriculture and the Cohesion Fund and focus it much more on the necessary aspects such as the agreements on the EU 2020 strategy .
<en> Secondly , more flexibility must be introduced , as the Commissioner has already indicated .
<en> Without flexibility , we could never have raised the funds for the recovery plan in connection with the crisis .
<en> We must step up the search for any areas where leeway remains , for opportunities for deploying funds differently .
<en> Thirdly , we need to innovate .
<en> An example is the transfer of funds from the Seventh Research Framework Programme to the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) .
<en> These funds were then used to provide subordinated loans to the business community and universities , thus giving tremendous momentum to investments for the coming years at this point in the crisis .
<en> I should like to know what your approach is to the matter , how the substance and the funds are to be linked .
<en> A final thought : perhaps you could go along with the ideas that have been expressed so often in this House .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to thank my colleague , Reimer Böge , for these questions and this debate on the budget .
<en> Earlier today , we voted on Budget 2011 and we all know how difficult it was to manoeuvre within the very tight margins in the budget .
<en> We also know that we were due a mid-term review of the budget .
<en> Regarding the non-paper which I read from the Commission , I would like to ask what status it has now .
<en> I know it is slightly off this point , but are some of the ideas contained in it still within the Commission 's framework for further discussion ?
<en> I am particularly concerned about attitudes to agriculture spending and any attempts to renationalise that policy .
<en> Others have , of course , discussed the realities for Member State budgets and Member State governments as well as the concern about looking for additional funding when all our Member States are having financial and economic problems .
<en> However , if we are to have more Europe , there is a requirement for more resources .
<en> I think one of the great difficulties we have in this Parliament is that we have not communicated enough the value of a European Union budget and what it does .
<en> If you recall - again in the votes today - we voted on the Globalisation Fund .
<en> When citizens are in difficulty , whether it is from flooding or a jobs crisis , they turn to the European Union for support and they turn to it for budget support .
<en> That provides solidarity to the European Union , which is something that you cannot put a price on .
<en> I think we have to be conscious of this .
<en> If we continue to measure and count euros , rather than looking at what we are trying to create in the European Union , I think we will limit our vision for the future of what we all hold dear at the European Union .
<en> That said , perhaps the analogy of a cake is appropriate at this point - that people look at the European Union budget in the shape of a cake .
<en> If we have more demands on it , we will continue to slice it ever thinner unless we increase the resources .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The Danish Liberal Party abstained from voting in the final vote on the Berès report on the financial crisis as it positively recommends the establishment of a financial transaction tax .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I , along with my Labour colleagues , voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents .
<en> There is , however , a need for continued , detailed debate on one issue in particular , a CCCTB .
<en> I agree it is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime .
<en> However , particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland , whose prosperity and employment levels depend , to a large extent , on its capacity to attract foreign investment .
<en> I wish to note also that the Irish Labour Party does not support a CCCTB .
<sp>
<2en> The Berès report covers issues of importance to the stability of the euro area , which I voted for .
<2en> However , I abstained in the final vote , because I believe that , firstly , a general and simplified approach is being taken to the economic and financial problems of the EU and to the measures that need to be taken and , secondly , it refers to the Commission proposals on sanctions for undisciplined Member States , such as other fiscal or financial measures , which the European Parliament has not yet debated and on which it has not yet reached any conclusions .
<2en> I therefore reserve the right to express a specific opinion at a later date .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Berès report because I believe in the need for effective cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission to find a way out of the economic and financial crisis .
<2en> The International Monetary Fund recently made public an analysis of the current state of the world economy , showing that the recovery process is still fragile and patchy .
<2en> In effect , we are facing two different scenarios : on the one hand , a stage of strong growth for emerging countries and , on the other , high levels of unemployment and an overall slow rate of recovery in economically more advanced States .
<2en> I therefore believe that it would be useful to embark on a path with the aim of guaranteeing appropriate solidity of public finances to maintain confidence in the markets and ensure that the public can again believe in the worth of the European project .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report by the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis , which represents a constructive compromise between all the groups involved .
<2en> We do not need less Europe , we need more of it !
<2en> Our national economies are closely intertwined - national egotisms will only intensify the crisis .
<2en> This report calls for Europe to be unanimous on essential issues .
<2en> Sustainable EU financial , economic and employment policy needs to be the cornerstone of our action .
<2en> The recommendations for action show a clear way forward : in future , businesses must have their credit ratings assessed by an independent EU ratings agency .
<2en> An end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax .
<2en> The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be better connected to the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> We are unambiguous in calling on the Commission to create a balance between growth , equality of opportunity and financial market stability .
<2en> There is a need to reduce the taxation on work in order to strengthen investment and thus , Europe 's competitiveness .
<2en> Small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular , need easier access to credit .
<2en> In the social sphere , the advancement of human resources - through real , tangible measures to get people trained and qualified - takes top priority .
<2en> Numerous public hearings , workshops and analyses have enabled us , as committee members , to make well-founded , fact-based contributions to the public debate .
<2en> It is important for Parliament to offer clear answers to crises .
<2en> Only in that way can we strengthen our credibility and reliability in the eyes of the citizens .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , giving money from one 's own pockets is an act of generosity .
<en> Giving money out of other peoples ' pockets , those of the taxpayer , is both less generous and less honest .
<en> The additional EUR 176 million will not just be given to the poorest countries , but also to emergent countries whose exports are already and increasingly destroying our manufacturing bases and the jobs of our taxpayers .
<en> A desire on the part of the EU to promote democracy and human rights in the Third World might be admirable , if it were not for the fact that European Union countries can , and do , imprison people who have committed neither acts of violence nor theft , but simply expressed heretical or dissenting opinions on political or academic subjects .
<en> European Union countries can , and do , ban political parties openly , as in Belgium and Germany , or by the back door by civil action , as in the United Kingdom .
<en> If we wish to spread democracy and human rights worldwide , we would do so more effectively and more cheaply by setting a good example .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this has been a fascinating debate .
<en> In a way , it very much coincides with yesterday 's speech here by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , when he clearly said that the EU and the United Nations share responsibility in this world in the fight against poverty , the fight against climate change and the fight against nuclear proliferation .
<en> It is a common challenge that we face .
<en> On the whole , our citizens today are not too worried about this issue because they believe that we take care of this issue and also promote our values .
<en> Transnistria was mentioned .
<en> It is not thousands of kilometres away from us ; it is very close .
<en> Concerning peace and security , it is true that we do not have too much conflict , but that is because we have an extremely active external policy in order to prevent any conflict as soon as it starts .
<en> I believe that we have experience that we can be proud of .
<en> Financial instruments definitely help us to address these challenges .
<en> I believe that today 's debate was basically very positive about the experience that we have had from the financial instruments .
<en> At the same time , I would emphasise that we have full accountability , and that it is taxpayers ' money .
<en> Whenever we start a project , there are ex ante controls and there are ex post controls afterwards .
<en> There is a Court of Auditors of the European Union that looks not only at whether the money is spent correctly , but also at the political reasoning behind this .
<en> The Committee on Budgetary Control is quite tough with regard to any Commission spending , so I can assure you that taxpayers ' money is very much valued and is spent with good purpose .
<en> We always discuss how to be more effective , but I can assure you that we follow policy objectives that have been agreed with this House .
<en> Today 's debate has already started the next debate , because ambition concerning the revision of financial instruments has been rather humble until now .
<en> We wanted just to adopt them until the year 2013 , with some particularities .
<en> Some of you address the challenge for countries that will have particular issues because of our agreement on the banana trade .
<en> It is necessary to adopt banana accompanying measures as soon as possible .
<en> It is not only our credibility which is at stake ; countries really face a challenge .
<en> That is the reasoning behind it .
<en> I believe that this House was very supportive of it .
<en> We have started to debate what will happen after 2013 , and I would draw your attention to the fact that this is the beginning of the debate .
<en> We are not prejudging what will happen after 2013 .
<en> The budget review was adopted by the Commission yesterday ; it will be considered in this House .
<en> I intend to discuss the Green Paper on modernisation and development policy within the Commission .
<en> I believe my colleagues will also come forward with issues .
<en> We need to agree on policy priorities and also financial instruments well in advance so that we do not need to make an adjustment later if we find that there is not sufficient money in one instrument and we try to cover some of the priorities with reallocation .
<en> I understand that this is not the best possible way , but it means that before adjusting the financial framework , we should agree what we would like to achieve , which instruments should be applied , and what scope we would like to see .
<en> I would like to emphasise that , as a Commissioner , I have two budgetary authorities .
<en> One is definitely this House , but the other is the Council .
<en> I believe this means that , for all the scrutinies that we will carry out and on which we should agree , we need to follow the letter of the Lisbon Treaty , with the political willingness to find the right compromise so that democratic scrutiny can be fully emphasised to show that it is efficient , swift and effective .
<en> This is exactly what we have discussed today in the meeting that I mentioned in the first speech .
<en> I have every reason to believe that we will find the necessary compromise .
<en> It will not be easy ; it will require a lot of political will .
<en> On the Commission side , we definitely have the political will because I know what the stakes are , particularly for some of the measures where we need a swift conclusion of this process .
<en> Thank you very much .
<en> I very much commend the work of the rapporteurs , which was very much appreciated from our side .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - What will happen after 2013 ?
<en> As regards the stability instrument , we have seen that it is wonderful because it is more flexible than other instruments , but that also occasionally leads to misuse for food crises , for humanitarian and natural disasters .
<en> That should really be stopped and we should clarify , for the period after 2013 , that this is really for conflict situations , and maybe add more flexibility to other instruments in order to address more emergency situations .
<en> Then there was another thing that I would like to highlight .
<en> The recent British defence review puts conflict prevention at the core of the External Action Service .
<en> I find that quite interesting and correct .
<en> I think it is the right way forward to say that the External Action Service should become the hub for conflict prevention , in the interest of internal coherence .
<en> The tools that it needs include the stability instrument .
<en> I see others , like a mediation cell , being created within the appropriate structures .
<en> I think we should build on this when we look at the period after 2013 , and ask : What do we need in terms of money and resources so as to really become a driving force for conflict prevention ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to offer a heartfelt greeting to Commissioner Piebalgs and appeal to him to take an active part , as I believe he sincerely will , in the measures to be voted on tomorrow , because it is a matter of great importance for the European Parliament , which will have greater power after the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> Thank you , Commissioner Piebalgs .
<2en> I should also like to thank all the speakers who gave their support during today 's debate .
<2en> I sincerely hope that tomorrow 's vote will obtain a very broad majority , if not unanimous approval , thereby ensuring a great victory for the report by Mr Mitchell , precisely because it is important that the European Parliament has greater powers after the Treaty of Lisbon .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to thank my fellow Members for participating in this debate .
<2en> Your comments have actually drawn attention to the same question that we , the rapporteurs , have had to grapple with in the past period .
<2en> I would like to thank the Commissioner for his constructive approach to this debate .
<2en> What we have seen today is that - as almost all speakers confirmed - the European financing instrument for democracy and human rights is a very important and perhaps the only instrument of the European Union for the democratisation of third countries and the defence of human rights designed in such a way that civil society organisations can receive it directly .
<2en> It can be paid out directly to organisations working in the field , without the support of the third country .
<2en> This is why it is important and we consider it necessary to promote every technical facilitation that will enable these organisations to access the aid that is often crucial to their survival .
<2en> At the same time , and for this very reason , since this programme involves such a priority area and we are talking about an instrument that is intended directly for these NGOs and civil society organisations , it is important that Parliament has a say in the elaboration of the strategy and long-term programme , and it is essential that Parliament should see how these funds are used , and not only at the end of the seven-year financial framework .
<2en> This is why we consider it important to emphasise Parliament 's democratic right of oversight and its right to have a say .
<2en> I believe that a joint solution will be found , especially after the meeting this morning with both Mrs Ashton and Commissioner Piebalgs , and I , too , seriously believe that if the political will is there , the legal obstacles will be overcome .
<2en> This , then , is the view we should take as we look ahead to the coming weeks .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Echoing what has been said by my fellow Members who have spoken so far , we are facing a very tough situation because the 20 000 inhabitants of Hatcliffe Extension are threatened with eviction .
<en> As you are aware , they belong to the most vulnerable section of the population in Zimbabwe , a country going through major political problems , on top of the extremely dire economic situation .
<en> Since its creation in February 2009 , Zimbabwe 's Unity Government has done very little to improve people 's situation , especially of those evicted in 2005 .
<en> I think that our response or reaction to this situation is very clear .
<en> The Government of Zimbabwe must take action in keeping with its international obligations .
<en> This means halting and / or preventing forced evictions .
<en> On the other hand , we definitely all want democracy to be restored in Zimbabwe .
<en> What we have there at the moment could not be further from this .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) As has already been stated in this House , Zimbabwe is one of the countries where hunger is reaching catastrophic proportions , according to the report from the International Food Policy Research Institute published last week .
<en> The rate of undernutrition among the population , the prevalence of underweight children and the infant mortality rate are the three indicators which dramatically highlight the chronic situation in terms of food shortages , affecting millions of people .
<en> At the same time , hundreds of thousands of the poorest people in Zimbabwe have been evicted from their homes as part of a barbaric eviction operation whose brutal name is translated as ' Drive Out Rubbish ' .
<en> These people have not only lost their homes , but also their jobs , thereby increasing the unemployment rate to 90 % of the country 's population .
<en> This is happening while the dictator Mugabe declared that the people were extremely happy .
<en> This was the view cynically expressed by the man who will remain in history the creator of the cruellest , long-standing dictatorship in the world .
<en> I believe that it is absolutely imperative for us to request the regime in Zimbabwe to halt the forced evictions as a matter of urgency , put an end to the serious human rights violations and persecution of activists from civil society , and to refrain from any acts of violence , which are increasing at an alarming rate .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Zimbabwe is a country whose powerful leaders have long held the people of their land in contempt , and they are making this abundantly clear
<en> Of course , we may protest , arguing that helpless people cannot be treated like cattle , that they cannot be driven out of their homes with no rhyme or reason , and be left without any help .
<en> Forced evictions of the poor in Harare are but a tiny example of the rule of Robert Mugabe and his accomplices who are sitting on the mineral riches of their country like frogs on a spring , exploiting and enriching themselves with these resources while letting the people of their country die from hunger .
<en> I believe it may be naive to expect that we may achieve a change through persuasion and criticism .
<en> Our measures should be more vigorous ; people like Mugabe only listen to financial consequences or brute force .
<en> I think we have some financial measures at our disposal .
<en> We need to reconsider the provision of financial and material aid to regimes that act like Mugabe 's regime , and simply seek other ways , including sanctions which might force these dictators to respect fundamental , and I stress , fundamental human rights .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , it is no wonder that our fellow Members here are so infuriated by Mugabe .
<en> He has made his country , Africa 's fertile granary , a conveyor belt of bad news .
<en> The substitute accommodation that the government has provided has proven to be totally inadequate and has led to a worsening of living conditions , which were already wretched .
<en> One of the official reasons given for the entire operation was that they were trying to prevent the spread of disease , but the fact that there was no treatment available after the evictions casts doubt on the government 's motives .
<en> Everyone knows about the situation in Zimbabwe .
<en> The corrupt nature of the government and the general mess in both the economy and in society are generally leading to a situation where the basics for existence are just not there .
<en> Because of this , we must expect Zimbabwe to give a clear indication of its ability and willingness to safeguard the standard of living of its nationals .
<en> Even if there are good reasons why a large number of people have to make way for major projects , a crucial starting point must also always be the welfare of the displaced population .
<en> This is something that Zimbabwe has unquestionably neglected , regardless of whether the reasons that they have given are acceptable or not .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the current situation in Zimbabwe is appalling and unacceptable .
<en> Nearly 700 people were victims of the 2005 Operation Murambatsvina forced evictions .
<en> Now 20 000 citizens face forced evictions from the Hatcliffe Extension near Harare .
<en> The government has imposed unaffordable lease renewal fees on the people who were evicted , and has failed to consult with citizens or to inform them of the upcoming regulations .
<en> Operation Garikai intended to assist those who were affected by the 2005 evictions is merely a continuation of the same human rights abuses .
<en> I join in insisting that Zimbabwe halt these evictions of citizens in the Harare region .
<en> I urge the government of Zimbabwe to immediately amend Operation Garikai to comply with all obligations under international and human rights law .
<en> I ask the Commission to raise this issue as a matter of urgency with the government of Zimbabwe .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Today 's vote sees the establishment of a new and important fund to finance projects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector through innovative financial instruments .
<2en> The fund has two aims : promoting energy saving and improvements in the environment and , at the same time , giving fresh impetus to Europe 's economic recovery .
<2en> The fund shall finance initiatives and energy projects , adopting a different philosophy from the past , no longer focusing on straight grants , which have many times been shown to be disastrous , but on the profitability of the investment .
<2en> If used well , I believe that this new formula will herald the coming of a new virtuous cycle for the revitalisation of the European economy .
<2en> Furthermore , the new financing instrument represents an important opportunity for the development of local entities , above all , those in the south of Italy .
<2en> In fact , the fund could also be integrated with other European funds , such as the European Regional Development Fund , for example .
<2en> By voting decisively in favour of this new fund , I am expressing my hope that this innovative type of financing could also be extended in the future to many other sectors , starting with road , rail , port and airport infrastructure .
<sp>
<2en> A commitment to energy efficiency and security is one of the European Union 's current priorities .
<2en> The scale of the economic and financial crisis Europe is currently suffering is leading it to seek solutions capable of providing a balanced response to the requirements of the modern world , notably by making use of existing financial resources .
<2en> I welcome the initiative to channel the unused sum of EUR 114 million allocated to the energy sector , as part of the European Energy Programme for Recovery , into initiatives in support of energy efficiency and renewable energy , in the spirit of the EU 2020 strategy .
<2en> The intention is for these new investment projects to contribute to creating jobs and increasing competitiveness in the sector .
<2en> I support the report 's stress on the importance of increasing decentralised investments , since the beneficiaries of the initiatives will be public authorities at the various levels of government , whether municipal , regional or national .
<2en> The role of the various parties involved will thus be strengthened and valued , demonstrating the success of the coordination carried out under the Covenant of Mayors .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this joint resolution because I consider the transatlantic relationship to be , without doubt , the most important foreign relationship for Europeans .
<2en> At the upcoming EU-US summit , both partners must cooperate on moving forward with a common agenda based on shared values such as the defence of democracy , of the rule of law and of human rights .
<2en> During a period of serious crisis and on the eve of a crucial G20 meeting , the EU and the US , which account for half the world economy between them , must be more committed than ever to working closely together on global economic recovery and on establishing measures for regulating the global financial system .
<2en> Joint action is needed on the great challenges faced by the world - the struggle against climate change , achieving the Millennium Development Goals , the Middle East peace process , the specific situations of Afghanistan and Iraq , and even the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
<2en> Such action must be the result of increased strategic dialogue and cooperation between the EU and the US , within the framework of existing multilateral institutions , notably the United Nations , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and NATO .
<2en> This will contribute to creating solutions .
<sp>
<2en> The unique relationship that binds the European Union and the United States is one of the strategic foundation stones of the European Union .
<2en> The transatlantic partnership , jointly representing half of the global economy and united by the common values of democracy and human rights , stands moreover as a guarantor of world stability .
<2en> The next EU-United States summit is a crucial juncture in this cooperation .
<2en> I voted for this text as it highlights the challenges that await this collaboration and the obligations that hang over it .
<2en> The revival of the dialogue between our two great powers , and the promotion of multilateral negotiations which characterises the policy of the new Obama administration , accentuate the importance of this text .
<2en> From this perspective , it provides the guidelines for the next summit , particularly in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , the Iranian nuclear issue , nuclear disarmament and the transatlantic security pact .
<2en> Finally , it calls for the Transatlantic Economic Council to be strengthened and highlights the need for the international financial system to be reformed , for cooperation as regards energy , environment , intellectual property and consumer protection to be developed , and for judicial and police cooperation .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I support this resolution .
<en> With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Union became an important player on the international stage .
<en> While the EU and the USA remain the strongest forces in the global economy , the serious consequences of the financial and economic crisis have led to the creation of a more integrated transatlantic market , which would create more favourable conditions for economic growth and sustainable social development .
<en> It is therefore necessary to develop bilateral cooperation as regards the preparation of a joint energy strategy , which would support diversification and security of energy and supply routes , promoting an ecologically efficient economy .
<en> Furthermore , in creating a new business culture , it is necessary to enhance the use of innovations , creativity and information and communication technologies and increase cooperation in the fields of education , research and science .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> It is essential to simplify access to the framework research programmes in order for there to be motivation for potential interested parties to access them and for important funds not to be squandered .
<2en> We cannot forget that research makes a vital contribution to economic growth , to job creation , and to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy .
<2en> It is therefore time to coordinate national , regional and European research policies , so that there are not considerable obstacles to obtaining cost-effective solutions .
<2en> That being the case , we need to move towards greater simplification and harmonisation of rules and procedures , as simplification is not just an isolated objective , but is rather a means of ensuring the attractiveness and accessibility of EU research funding .
<sp>
<2en> There is increasing despondency among researchers , research institutes , universities and businesses with the research framework programmes due to the complex nature of the European Commission 's tendering procedure .
<2en> However , the 2020 strategy aims to improve the framework conditions and access to funding for research and innovation to ensure that innovative ideas can be turned into goods and services creating growth and jobs .
<2en> Therefore , in the interests of efficiency and with a view to promoting the highest quality research , it was highly desirable to simplify the implementation of the research framework programmes .
<2en> We had to take these measures to remain attractive in order to attract and keep the best scientists in Europe and remain competitive in a global economy .
<2en> I welcome the draft report which intends to promote a balance between trust and control , between risk taking and risk prevention , while ensuring sound financial management .
<sp>
<2en> I agree that we must simplify the funding of these programmes , but on one condition - after the result has been achieved , it must be available free of charge to all EU countries .
<2en> Otherwise , what will happen is this - one EU nation will carry out the research project with EU Structural Fund money , with common EU resources , therefore , but then , after it has obtained the result - be it a new product or new technology , it will sell it to other EU Member States .
<2en> This is unacceptable .
<2en> It is important that all who provide funding should be able to dispose of the results of research projects carried out with common EU funds free of charge .
<sp>
<2en> During the economic crisis which developed out of the financial crisis , between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion from the EU budget was redeployed to energy projects from other subsidy funds which still had money available in order to aid the recovery of the economy .
<2en> As the Commission explained in its presentation of the 2020 energy strategy , an investment of EUR 1 trillion is needed to develop the outdated power grid in Europe over the next few years .
<2en> It is to be expected that consumers will have to pay the cost of this , rather than the energy sector .
<2en> An important factor in this respect will be energy research , providing that it focuses on the genuinely more cost-effective technologies .
<2en> We must bring an end to the emphasis on nuclear power which , in addition to posing the risk of environmental catastrophes , is by no means cost-effective when the cost of expensive terminal storage , a problem which has not yet been resolved , is included .
<2en> We must devote our attention to green technologies .
<2en> I have voted in favour of the report .
<sp>
<2en> The report aims to simplify procedures and reduce costs .
<2en> It will also create incentives for an increase in the involvement of the private sector .
<2en> For this reason , I have voted in favour of this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Berlinguer report insofar as it concerns aspects of fundamental importance for enabling a shift towards a Europe of the citizens and for promoting the development of a European judicial culture .
<2en> In particular , the report addresses in a balanced and exhaustive way issues concerning the training of judges ; cooperation between judicial authorities ; European contract law ; fundamental rights , including freedom of enterprise , so as to develop entrepreneurship in all economic sectors ; and the mutual recognition of official documents issued by national administrations , including the effects of civil status documents .
<sp>
<2en> The Stockholm Programme aims to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens in an area of freedom , security and justice .
<2en> However , the differences in the various legal systems of the Member States are creating barriers to the development of European legislation .
<2en> That is why I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution , which proposes the convergence and harmonisation of civil , commercial , family and private international law and focuses on cooperation between the various legal systems of the Member States by :
<2en> • nurturing a common European judicial culture ;
<2en> • educating and training judges , prosecutors and other court officers , with the aim of building mutual understanding of the legal systems of the other Member States and resolving cross-border disputes ;
<2en> • creating a regular forum so that judges in areas of law where cross-border issues arise can examine areas of legal controversy or difficulty with the aim of building a climate of mutual confidence ;
<2en> • introducing a European contract law ;
<2en> • introducing cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters .
<sp>
<2en> The Stockholm Programme adopted in December 2009 establishes the priorities for the development of a European area of freedom , security and justice over the next five years .
<2en> In this context , it is important to point out the significant results that have already been achieved , and to hope that the recommended measures can help to respond to the real needs of the public and businesses , facilitating their mobility and the exercise of their rights and freedoms in the single market , without jeopardising the requirements of the principle of subsidiarity and respect for diversity of the legal approaches and constitutional traditions of the different Member States .
<sp>
<2en> Today , we voted in plenary on a proposal for a resolution on positive law aspects of the Action Plan implementing the Stockholm Programme , in other words , European Union priorities for the development of an area of freedom , security and justice in the period 2010-2014 with particular regard to aspects of civil , commercial and private international law .
<2en> The dossier calls on the Commission to improve the proposal submitted in an attempt to overcome certain problems and critical areas that occur specifically in international judicial practice .
<2en> Assisting national judges on technical aspects of the proposed measures during legislative drafting and the establishment of an independent European claims instrument , which would , amongst other things , make it possible to resolve , at least partly , problems raised by differences of opinion in national procedural law , are specific examples of the constructive and approving approach that a common and extensively discussed proposal for a resolution could have on European legislation .
<2en> In an area as important to citizens as civil law , it is necessary to respect and accommodate radically different legal approaches and constitutional traditions but it is also necessary to face up to the negative legal consequences for citizens arising out of this difference .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This is a good regulation calling mainly for the use of every possible means to nurture a European judicial culture , particularly through legal education and training .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this is the second time that I have sat in this Chamber and seen the President interrupt one of the speakers on the basis that they are speaking too quickly .
<en> I do not know how often you speak yourself , but you should understand that such an interruption has the consequence of completely wrecking the speech .
<en> Now , I happen to disagree entirely with what Mr Désir said , but I think that , really , the interpreters are paid employees and if they cannot keep up , that is their problem .
<en> It is not for the President to interrupt in the way that you have just done .
<sp>
<en> It certainly is my job to interrupt .
<en> You can pay a one-hundred-metre runner EUR 1 million to run the one-hundred-metre race in 10 seconds .
<en> However , even if you pay him EUR 100 million , he will not manage to do it in five seconds .
<en> I am obliged to interrupt Members if they speak too quickly .
<en> I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and I know very well that when the interpreters can no longer keep up , they press a button and a bulb on my desk lights up .
<en> You are very welcome to have a look at it .
<en> It is labelled ' slow down ' .
<en> I have already experienced this in the committees .
<en> At some point , the interpreters say that they are going to stop working .
<en> If a Member then complains , the whole thing comes to a grinding halt and the speaker cannot go on speaking .
<en> ( Heckling )
<en> Mrs Berès , I am doing what you also do in your committee , which is to explain the situation when a point of order is raised .
<en> ( Heckling )
<en> It is precisely the same thing .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me assure you that if ever I were to run the 100 metres , it would take me at least 15 seconds , so there is no major problem with me - at least not in that respect .
<en> First , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the INTA Committee for these reports , which raise important issues concerning the contribution of the European Union 's trade policy towards the achievement of some of the fundamental objectives of public policy : respect for human rights , the pursuit of economic welfare and social justice , the achievement of sustainable growth and respect for the environment and particularly the climate system .
<en> You will understand that , in the short time I have at my disposal today , it is impossible to go into the details of each one .
<en> But allow me to make a few general considerations .
<en> The three reports have many points in common .
<en> They all address policy coherence and , more particularly , the need for trade policy to be conducted in the framework of the EU 's overall objectives , in particular its economic , social and environmental objectives .
<en> I could not agree more with the goal of fully using all the instruments at our disposal to achieve these aims .
<en> At the same time , it should be stressed that effective action must rely on those instruments that are most suitable to address each issue .
<en> I see trade policy as one of the key factors in promoting and safeguarding the European Union 's social model , its values and its principles , and I am aware that there are high expectations in this respect .
<en> But we must bear in mind that not all problems can necessarily be solved through trade policy .
<en> Other policies may offer key elements or even better options for effective solutions .
<en> We must also be aware that balancing different interests is at the core of political action .
<en> So there will always be choices to be made .
<en> Challenges will also be different , depending on whether we are considering autonomous instruments such as GSP , bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements .
<en> Ms Saïfi 's report on human rights , social and environmental standards in trade agreements recognises that each of those dimensions offers different possibilities .
<en> In general , international cooperation has the potential to trigger more effective action .
<en> On the other hand , it takes two to tango .
<en> We have to take account of what is acceptable to our trade partners - and at what price .
<en> Especially when it comes to multilateral settings , achieving consensus can become very hard .
<en> The EU has a general interest in improving international governance , including through increased coherence between actions in different fora : the WTO , the ILO , the international climate negotiations , and so on .
<en> The three reports outline several possible directions of work in this respect .
<en> We need to be pragmatic and be able to discern between those practical steps likely to prove successful in the short term and those steps more likely to produce an effect in the longer-term objectives .
<en> We need to give ourselves the scope to think ahead and think big .
<en> On the other hand , the Commission wants trade policy and our actions in trade bodies to have an impact and lead to results .
<en> This also applies to our bilateral deals .
<en> The provisions in our free trade agreements are not there to become mere declarations of good intentions .
<en> They must be ' implementable ' .
<en> Turning to Mr Jadot 's report on climate change , I would like to highlight the need to ensure that any options are indeed capable of effectively reducing the risk of carbon leakage and of being applied at reasonable cost .
<en> We all know , for instance , that options such as border measures raise a number of issues : how to measure , how to monitor , and so on .
<en> The truth is that we need to exercise caution and assess all relevant issues before precipitating conclusions .
<en> That said , the EU should definitely continue to look into all feasible options .
<en> As regards Mr Désir 's report on corporate social responsibility , I note the statement that ' Commission initiatives should focus on supporting rather than regulating CSR activities ' .
<en> There is , however , a fine line to be drawn between supporting , regulating and enforcing - a line that the rapporteur has skilfully explored but that embodies a great number of political and practical considerations .
<en> Indeed , CSR cannot replace states or exempt them from their responsibility in enforcing their laws - just as state bodies are not there to enforce corporate policies as such .
<en> It is useful to note that many of these issues are being considered in the update of the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises due for adoption in 2011 .
<en> This is one example of the useful work being carried out and in which we are actively engaged .
<en> The reports under consideration today include very specific orientations on possible avenues for increasing the scope , effectiveness , consistency and transparency of our actions as regards social and environmental provisions in FTAs , including provisions on CSR or climate change issues .
<en> Needless to say , the Commission will continue to consider these orientations .
<en> In line with the caveats that I have already spelled out , you should anticipate important reservations on several points - as well as wholehearted agreement on others .
<en> We will have plenty of opportunities , for instance under next year 's GSP review , to discuss these issues further in the following months or years , including in the context of upcoming legislative or consent procedures .
<en> The European Commission is willing to examine - together with the European Parliament - suitable , effective and workable means to ensure that trade policy duly reflects societal concerns .
<en> The guiding principle should be careful , analytical policymaking on the basis of forward-looking objectives but also of realistic expectations .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . - Mr President , should Europe 's trade policy simply be about obtaining maximum economic advantage , or should it be used to underpin and promote our wider goals : sustainable environment policy , fight against climate change , our social model , the promotion of human rights and democratic values ?
<en> The three speakers before me - the three rapporteurs - have all confirmed that the answer to that should be in the affirmative and , I am pleased to say , so has the Commissioner .
<en> Indeed , already in our actions we do put human rights , environmental protection and labour standards in our bilateral trade agreements .
<en> But the question is : do we do it in a way that allows us to ensure proper application and compliance with these standards ?
<en> The Subcommittee on Human Rights of this Parliament has serious doubts about our effectiveness so far .
<en> In the case of future trade agreements , we would like to ensure that , before any agreement is initialled , an FTA is subject to a human rights impact assessment to make sure that there are not only economic benefits from the agreement , but human rights gains from any such agreement .
<en> We believe that the system for suspending free trade agreements for abuse of human rights must be made more transparent and accessible , and I acknowledge the fact that Mr De Gucht in the Korea FTA has started to go down that route .
<en> We believe that in relation to GSP + , beneficiaries must be subjected to consistent and fairer benchmarking to make sure that their application of environmental , social and human standards remains at a high level and consistent .
<en> Mrs Saïfi , Mr Désir and Mr Jadot have all made it very clear that trade must not be viewed as an end in itself but must be part of a wider global strategy to promote a fairer , safer and healthier planet .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am pleased that Mr De Gucht , Mr Désir and Mrs Saïfi understand very well that if we are to have equal trade conditions , then standards - and I mean standards in a broad sense , including human rights and social and environmental standards - must undergo extensive harmonisation .
<2en> These standards are an extremely important matter , not only for world trade , but also for cooperation on development , and even more importantly , for the pursuit of values which we call fundamental values .
<2en> The Committee on Development has tabled several remarks about the Saïfi report .
<2en> We regret , for example , that the European Union does not have an overall approach to the way in which businesses meet human rights obligations .
<2en> This allows some firms and Member States to ignore these standards .
<2en> We insist on compliance with the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation as a preliminary condition for entering into trade agreements .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The importance of ensuring the pluralism of broadcast media is due to the pivotal role that such media play in our society in terms of information and pluralism , as well as the promotion of rights , freedoms and guarantees , which clearly contribute to a more informed and participatory society .
<2en> It is therefore of paramount importance to ensure that these services have financial and editorial autonomy , and that they are prevented from becoming politicised or making concessions to economic interests .
<2en> In Portugal , there have recently been reports of possible government interference in the field of news , including the replacement of the editor of a daily newspaper and the head of news at a radio station , along with the sudden cancellation of a commercial channel 's news programme and the replacing of its director-general .
<2en> There have also been several incidents where columnists who were critical have been removed , and an alleged plan for a company in which the state holds a golden share to acquire a stake in a media company that owns a private channel .
<2en> In view of this , it is vital to give precedence to a dual EU system that ensures independence at all levels and which safeguards freedom of expression in both public and private sector broadcasting services , given that the latter are not immune to political interference .
<sp>
<2en> The EU audiovisual landscape is characterised by what is described as a ' dual system ' .
<2en> The coexistence of public service and commercial broadcasters has ensured a very diverse range of programming .
<2en> This has contributed to media pluralism , cultural and linguistic diversity , editorial competition ( in terms of content quality and diversity ) within the media , and freedom of expression .
<2en> I would like to highlight the need for the Member States to address the digital divide between urban and rural zones and to ensure that , with digitisation , all individuals in all regions have equal access to public service broadcasting , along with offering attractive , quality content to appeal to young people who access the media .
<sp>
<2en> The main message which we wanted to convey with this report is that we need to keep public service broadcasting independent .
<2en> We insisted in the additions made to the draft report on the need to make appointments to management boards based only on competence and not on political bias .
<2en> In addition , we have endeavoured to make as clear as possible our wish not only for public stations with high quality , attractive content , but also for the integration of new platforms , taking into account the latest technologies .
<2en> One point which we insisted on was investment in public service broadcasting , without which it is impossible to operate to high standards .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The British Conservative delegation supported this report because it recognised that under the ' Amsterdam Protocol ' , it is the exclusive competence of Member States to define the public service remit and to provide funding of public sector broadcasters .
<en> This is of importance to the UK because of the unique method of funding of the BBC and we welcome this confirmation that the European Parliament will not try to intrude into the funding methods used in the UK to fund the BBC .
<en> There were two issues that the UK delegation could not support in this report : the call for search engines and Internet service providers to provide funding for the financing of content creation on the Internet and the call for a European Audiovisual Observatory to gather data on national public sector broadcasters .
<en> The UK delegation therefore requested separate votes on these paragraphs and voted against them .
<en> However , overall , the report is a balanced approach to this subject and for this reason , the British Conservative delegation supported this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome this resolution , which reaffirms Parliament 's commitment to the dual broadcasting system , in which private and public service media play their respective roles , independent of political and economic pressure , and calls for access to broadcasting of the highest level to be ensured irrespective of consumers ' and users ' ability to pay .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The reason why I voted in favour of this resolution on the current situation in Western Sahara is rooted in the commitment that has always been shown , with particular emphasis on the way the conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front over Western Sahara has developed , above all , because of the obvious implications of that problem for stability in the region .
<2en> Clearly , Morocco has been invited on several occasions to maintain an open , flexible dialogue with no preconditions in order to obtain small but significant steps forward in the peace talks brokered by the United Nations .
<2en> I personally have always supported the efforts made by the UN and its envoy , Mr Ross , aimed at holding bilateral political , negotiated and sustainable talks between the two parties .
<2en> In many EU countries , including Italy , there is widespread sensitivity and awareness regarding the conditions in which the Sahrawi people live , with particular understanding for Morocco 's positions and points of view .
<2en> The Union , particularly the Mediterranean countries , has always been to the fore in terms of giving the Sahrawi people humanitarian aid , because the principle of solidarity towards people living in such problem circumstances is fundamental .
<2en> I voted as I did with a view to achieving a gradual improvement in the current situation through a reciprocal commitment to cooperation and dialogue .
<sp>
<2en> I supported this resolution as I believe that the fight for human rights is crucial .
<2en> There have been reports from Western Sahara of instances of police violence against citizens who were holding a non-violent protest camp outside the city of Laâyoune against the social , political and economic situation and against their living conditions .
<2en> The police forces used tear gas and batons against the demonstrators in order to evacuate the camp .
<2en> This is more than a political issue with a neighbouring state .
<2en> We are looking at a violation of human rights that we must all condemn , without exception , and so I am voting in favour of this resolution and adding my voice to those of my fellow Members in urging all parties to remain calm and refrain from all acts of violence .
<sp>
<2en> Following the multiple attempts by the Moroccan regime to prevent Parliament from expressing its opinion on the human rights situation in the Western Sahara , we must welcome the fact that on this occasion , the Moroccan lobby has failed .
<2en> I consider the constant interference by Morocco to be unacceptable .
<2en> Likewise , the text of the resolution is just a compromise between positions that are based on very different analyses .
<2en> I therefore wish to state our group 's position in favour of the Sahrawi people , and specifically our condemnation of the provocative and irresponsible way in which the Gdaim Izyk camp was dismantled .
<2en> We cannot place those who attack , torture and massacre on the same level as those who seek to defend themselves .
<2en> There needs to be an independent investigation , and freedom of access and movement needs to be given to those responsible for the media and information .
<2en> The EU , and especially Spain and France , must assume their historical responsibility and demand that Morocco ceases its inhibiting and intransigent attitude , even by freezing the numerous trade agreements and special relationships that exist between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco , and by doing everything possible to ensure that the referendum on self-determination included in numerous United Nations resolutions is held .
<sp>
<2en> The violent incidents that occurred in Western Sahara as the Gdaim Izyk camp was being dismantled and in the town of Laâyoune are very serious and must be roundly condemned .
<2en> The European Parliament is quite right to express its concerns about how the situation in the region has deteriorated .
<2en> As the United Nations has pointed out , the parties involved in the conflict need to agree to seek a realistic political solution that is fair , sustainable , acceptable to both sides and in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions .
<2en> However , it is unfortunate that the text was produced before Parliament had access to all of the facts and detailed information about the circumstances that triggered this tragedy , including the exact number of victims .
<2en> Journalists , independent investigators , observers and political decision makers need to be given time and access to the town of Laâyoune and the refugee camps in order to shed light on the events .
<2en> The distress of the Sahrawi people should in no way be exploited to incite further acts of violence .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the joint resolution on Western Sahara .
<en> However , I strongly regret that the resolution fails to mention and criticise the illegal fisheries agreement between EU and Morocco , which allows European fishing fleets to operate in waters within the occupied Western Sahara territory .

<en> Dear President-in-Office Chastel , dear High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission Lady Ashton , dear guests ,
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) A message to the European Parliament : Santa Clara , 14 December 2010
<en> Dear Mr Jerzy Buzek , President of the European Parliament ,
<en> Dear Vice-Presidents and honourable Members of this multi-national democratic forum ,
<en> Unfortunately , for want of the tolerance that we so much need on this tormented planet of ours , I cannot be with you as a representative of the Cuban people in rebellion and those Cuban citizens who have lost their dread of the totalitarian government which has been repressing us for a shameful total of 52 years , whose latest victim is the martyr Orlando Zapata Tamayo .
<en> Unluckily for those who misgovern us in our own homeland the fact that I cannot leave and return voluntarily to the island where I was born is , in itself , the most irrefutable witness to the fact that unfortunately , nothing has changed in the autocratic system ruling my country .
<en> In the minds of Cuba 's current rulers , we Cuban citizens are just like the slaves from whom I am descended , kidnapped in Africa and brought to the Americas by force .
<en> For me or any other ordinary citizen to be able to travel abroad , I need a Carta de Libertad , that is a Freedom Card , just as the slaves did : only today it is called a Carta Blanca , a White Card .
<en> My deepest hope is that you will not allow yourselves to be deceived by the siren songs of a cruel regime practising ' wild communism ' whose only desire , after pretending to make ostensible economic changes , is that the European Union and the European Parliament will rescind the Common Position , and allow the regime to benefit from the loans and investments used to help Third World countries under the Cotonou Agreements .
<en> Former political prisoners or prisoners of conscience , recently released by ' wild communism ' , will surely have taken their seats alongside you .
<en> It would be a mistake to think that they were set at liberty ; they and their families are subject to ' psychological banishment ' , because their nearest and dearest were blackmailed by the neo-Stalinist Cuban Government .
<en> We , the peaceful opposition within Cuba , take a stocial , rational approach to the material or spiritual difficulties we suffer , as we do to the risk of losing our freedom and even our lives , being as we are part of the leastfavoured sector of the population .
<en> Here , inside Cuba , we are all suffering , but we do not complain , for that reason we hope to be able to rely on your support .
<en> Dear Members of the European Parliament , I ask you not to give in to the claims of the Cuban ruling elite , unless the following five demands are met :
<en> First : continue with the release , without banishment , of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , and make a public commitment never to imprison non-violent political opponents .
<en> Second : put an immediate end to the violent beating-up and threatening of the peaceful opposition within the country by the regime 's military and paramilitary followers .
<en> Third : announce that all Cuban laws which contravene the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are to be examined and repealed .
<en> Four : grant the wherewithal , in daily practice , for establishing opposition parties , mass media not subordinate to the ' State socialism ' system , independent trade unions and any other kinds of peaceful social bodies .
<en> Five : publicly accept that all Cubans living in the diaspora have the right to take part in Cuba 's cultural , economic , political and social life .
<en> At this crucial juncture in the history of my country , you and all men and women of goodwill throughout the world need to pay close attention to the continual social outbursts and protests within Cuba , caused by frustration in the face of the overweening power of a government capable of issuing the order to murder my compatriots .
<en> I hope to God that there will be no unnecessary civil war between Cubans due to a blind refusal to accept that the political model of ' State socialism ' has been and is a failure wherever there has been an attempt to introduce it : something acknowledged by the historic leader of the ill-named Cuban Revolution himself in the foreign press .
<en> The old men who govern Cuba , in their daily contempt for those they govern , do not wish to understand that they should be public servants , and that all genuine public servants give their compatriots the possibility of replacing them or endorsing them .
<en> No person in power should seek to be served by those he governs , as is the case in Cuba .
<en> With our sisters and brothers in the struggle who share democratic ideals , with those who are still in prison , those who enjoy ostensible freedom in the streets , and those who have departed into the harshness of exile , we shall continue our unequal non-violent struggle against the Castrist oppressors , and with the help of God , we will win the battle without bloodshed .
<en> If there is one thing that I do in the company of my dissident colleagues , it is to banish any rancour against my political adversaries from my soul .
<en> The fact is - and this makes us better human beings to tackle the task of rebuilding our homeland - that in this struggle I have learned to be guided by the words of the first known dissident , Jesus Christ : ' love thine enemies ' .
<en> I thank the European Parliament for not abandoning the Cuban people in these more than 50 years of the struggle for democracy .
<en> In accepting the 2010 Andrei Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Conscience that has been awarded to me I do so because I feel myself to be a tiny part of the rebellious spirit that nourishes the people I am proud to belong to .
<en> I am extremely grateful to you , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the European Parliament , for this gesture shows that you have not forgotten the sufferings we endure , and thus your gesture brings the light of freedom that much closer to my country .
<en> May God grant that in Cuba we shall shortly see reconciliation amongst His children , and that the country will be blessed with democracy .

<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Yesterday , the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the Cuban citizen Guillermo Fariñas , who was absent .
<2en> His chair was empty , because the Cuban Government would not have allowed him to return home .
<2en> This is a shocking and symbolic example , serving as a brutal reminder that the human rights situation in the world is not improving .
<2en> The practice of the death penalty close to home in Belarus , hangings and stonings in Iran , female genital mutilation in Somalia , mass rapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the murdering of journalists in Russia , 215 million children working , arbitrary detentions , unfair trials , censorship , and so many other barbarities that require the European Union to be steadfast and uncompromising .
<2en> The report adopted today requires us to put human rights at the heart of the European Union 's external action , in its development , defence , trade , fishing , immigration and justice policies .
<2en> The universality of these values must take precedence over geopolitics , once again cynically revealed on 10 December 2010 when 15 countries made a cowardly response to China 's express request that they boycott the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese citizen , Lu Xiaobo .
<sp>
<2en> I should like to congratulate Mrs Andrikienon her excellent work .
<2en> Parliament 's annual report on human rights - this year in relation to 2009 - is a point of reference for all those interested in the issue .
<2en> This edition is even more important , because it is the first since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , which grants the European Union greater powers in foreign policy .
<2en> In fact , the greatest hope for human rights is the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon in terms of foreign policy : The European External Action Service must reflect the priorities and the spirit of the Treaty .
<2en> One of the priorities of a coherent foreign policy should be the promotion of democracy and human rights .
<2en> Lastly , I note that Parliament 's annual report on human rights not only provides a long list of problems ; it also suggests solutions .
<2en> The report notes the abolition of the death penalty in several countries , the progress made on violence against women , the protection of children , the fight against torture , protection for human rights activists , the promotion of democracy and religious freedom , and so on .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - As usual , the final text has good and bad news .
<en> Among the positive points : First of all , the amendment in two parts relating to Magnitsky was adopted with a large majority ( + 318 , -163 and 95 abstentions ) .
<en> S & D and ALDE amendments were all adopted ( LGBT , death penalty / lethal injection ) .
<en> Two GUE amendments were adopted ( equal access to healthcare / treatment and Colombia ) .
<en> However , among the negative points , we have to mention that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteur ( EPP ) relating to the EIDHR and the need to dedicate more projects to democracy instead of HR were adopted .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Mrs Andrikienė 's report because I believe that we need to stress once again that respecting human rights is the reflection of a modern society .
<2en> All human beings are born free and equal , and it is clearly our duty to do everything possible to ensure that this is the case across the world .
<2en> Notwithstanding the fact that the European Union 's external policy has made some important strides in recent years , the road to adopting a shared and coherent policy for the promotion of human rights is still a long one .
<2en> First of all , the Council and the Commission need to improve the European Union 's capacity for rapid response to violations in third countries .
<2en> Beginning with the firm condemnation of the death penalty across the European Union , we need to strive to achieve and reaffirm human rights on a daily basis .
<2en> In this vein , I should like to conclude by noting that , as Mahatma Gandhi said , the protection of human rights is the necessary precondition for peace .
<2en> This should never be forgotten .
<sp>
<2en> The report on the annual report on human rights in the world in 2009 and EU policy on the matter provides a near total overview of human rights problems across the world .
<2en> The report also takes up new types of human rights issues , such as human rights protection and the fight against terrorism .
<2en> Thanks to the amendments of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , a chapter has been included on the role of human rights in the newly-established European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
<2en> This is very important given the fact that , as a new instrument , the EEAS is able to provide us with an opportunity to review the EU 's human rights policy and to defend human rights worldwide in a more coherent and decisive way .
<2en> I therefore support 100 % the proposal to appoint a high representative , who , together with his / her service , will coordinate the Union 's human rights policy on a permanent basis .
<2en> The core message is clear : human rights should occupy a central place in the foreign policy of the European Union .
<2en> There is still a long way to go , but Parliament will keep its finger on the pulse .
<2en> That is an exceptionally positive thing .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this recommendation prepared by the European Parliament because I approve of the Council 's draft Decision on Switzerland 's participation in the ' Youth in Action ' and Lifelong Learning programmes .
<2en> Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area , Switzerland is nevertheless cooperating closely with the European Union in the fields of education , training and youth affairs .
<2en> This agreement is appropriate because Switzerland is committed to complying with the conditions and provisions laid down by the European Commission .
<2en> Furthermore , projects and initiatives submitted by participants from Switzerland will be subject to the same conditions , rules and procedures as are applied to projects from Member States .
<2en> Switzerland will conform to EU financial control and audit provisions .
<2en> In accordance with the bilateral agreement , Switzerland will establish a National Agency to coordinate implementation of the programmes at national level and will make an annual financial contribution to each programme ( in 2011 , EUR 1.7 million to the Youth in Action programme and EUR 14.2 million to the Lifelong Learning programme ) .
<sp>
<2en> Cooperation with Switzerland on education matters is an important step in EU-Switzerland relations .
<2en> The two programmes in question support lifelong learning and the inclusion of young people in European integration , through tolerance and solidarity between young Europeans .
<2en> The agreement between the Commission and Switzerland is adequate , given that Swiss participants in these programmes apply on an equal footing with all other young Europeans , and that Switzerland is committed to adapting to European rules and their supervision , as well as to contributing to both programmes financially .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome the adoption of this report in my capacity as the Chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Switzerland .
<en> The European Commission , the European Parliament and the Member States of the European Union agreed to establish the ' Youth in Action ' programme , which puts into effect the legal framework to support non-formal learning activities for young people .
<en> The aim of this proposal is to provide for the participation of Switzerland in the Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes .
<en> Switzerland is the only European country to take part in these programmes without being a member of the EEA , a candidate or a potential candidate country .
<en> Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area , Switzerland has shown sustained interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the education , training and youth fields .
<sp>
<2en> We are all very much aware that a good education system which ensures that young people receive the best possible education is enormously important for every country .
<2en> A good level of qualifications , knowledge and education has a direct impact on culture and the labour market and , as a result , citizens ' standard of living .
<2en> Each country wants to be proud of its young people , and each young person wants the opportunity to get to know new cultures and languages and to acquire professional experience abroad .
<2en> The European Union can be proud of its well-developed student exchange system and of its open labour markets , which mean that every young European has a great many opportunities for intellectual and professional development .
<2en> Switzerland 's participation in the ' Youth in Action ' programme demonstrates that cooperation with the European Union , particularly in the field of education , is of great importance to the country .
<2en> We should not prevent young Swiss citizens from enjoying the privileges and possibilities of a Community education .
<sp>
<2en> The attention being focused on education and training , on research and , in particular , on the resource provided to the European Union in its young people , is steadily growing .
<2en> By providing new learning opportunities , we want to offer our citizens more chances .
<2en> Education , training , cultural , research and youth programmes are a key element in this strategy .
<2en> The aim of the ' Youth in Action ' programme is to inspire a feeling of active European citizenship , solidarity and tolerance among Europeans , from adolescence to adulthood .
<2en> The programme promotes mobility both inside and beyond the EU 's borders and encourages the inclusion of all young people , irrespective of their educational , social and cultural background .
<2en> As a member of the Delegation for relations with Switzerland and Norway , I voted for this report as I think that the agreement signed between the Commission and the Swiss authorities is completely appropriate and in their mutual interest .
<2en> This will enable us to help as many young people as possible acquire new skills and offer them learning opportunities with a European dimension .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to begin by quoting some data from a study conducted by Amnesty International this month , in December 2010 .
<2en> At least 10 000 convicts and at least 6 000 refugees are caned each year in Malaysia .
<2en> There are numerous canings in detention facilities , and Mr Tannock has said that , unfortunately , Malaysia is not the only country in which anachronistic punishments of this type are applied : there is also talk of Singapore .
<2en> What is , however , problematic in the case of Malaysia is the fact that a more significant number of crimes and offences attract a caning sentence : to be more precise , 66 in Malaysia , compared with 30 in Singapore .
<2en> We are talking not only about violent or sexual crimes , but also drug taking , and especially infringements of immigration provisions .
<2en> I concur , on the other hand , with the perspective that my colleague , Mr Posselt , has embraced , saying that we are talking about torture , which is absolutely prohibited under international law .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , Parliament 's resolution is timely and important .
<en> Thousands of people are subject to caning in Malaysia every year .
<en> Caning is an inhuman and degrading form of punishment which should be abolished everywhere in the world .
<en> Caning is a form of torture .
<en> According to Amnesty International , a Muslim woman was caned last year in Malaysia where Sharia law is applied .
<en> The reason for the punishment was drinking beer .
<en> Amnesty International has also reported on the caning of refugees and immigrant workers in Malaysia .
<en> We urge the government of Malaysia to abolish caning as a form of punishment .
<en> We also call on the Malaysian Government to ratify the Protocol to the United Nations Convention on Torture , as well as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we are pleased by Malaysia 's economic development and the improved living conditions of the Malaysian people .
<2en> At the same time , however , we are incredulous at Amnesty International 's report describing the widespread use of the punishment of caning in Malaysia .
<2en> This really is a harsh punishment , use of which is often over the top , as it is sometimes meted out for minor and very dubious offences .
<2en> In my opinion , it is particularly cruel to hand down this sentence to illegal immigrants or people found on Malaysian territory without valid documents , including political refugees from Burma .
<2en> The ruthless nature of this punishment , however , conceals the unspoken truth regarding the traditional conditions and nature of the punishment of caning as practised in Malaysia .
<2en> Many of the misdemeanours which carry the punishment of caning are related to violations of Islamic religious law and customs deriving from this law .
<2en> An example of this is the case of Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno , who was sentenced to caning in 2009 for drinking beer in a bar .
<2en> The situation requires our response .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , traditional Islamic Sharia law , which is applied even in many moderate Islamic countries , permits corporal punishment for infringements of the law .
<2en> There was the notorious case from Malaysia of a punishment of six strokes of the cane imposed on the model Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno for being caught drinking beer .
<2en> After the announcement of the punishment , however , which was to have been performed with a rattan cane in a women 's prison , the punishment of six blows of the cane , handed down to a 32 year old mother of two children , was commuted to three months ' community service on the basis of a ruling by the Malaysian sultan , Ahmed Shah , who supervises compliance with Islamic rules in Malaysia .
<2en> Things went rather worse , however , for 46 year old Indonesian , Nasarudin Kamaruddin , who got 6 blows of the cane and one year in prison for the same offence .
<2en> Judge Abdul Rahman Mohamed Yunos , who also sentenced Kartika Shukarno , said of the judgment ' The aim of the verdict is not to punish but to teach ' .
<2en> A similar argument was used in defence of his ruling by Wee Ka Siong , Deputy Education Minister , when he justified the corporal punishment of children in schools , adding that the punishment could be carried out only by directors of schools or assigned persons , that parents would be informed about a punishment , and that a witness would be present when the punishment was carried out .
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , what we are talking about is nothing exotic .
<2en> It is everyday life in the so-called moderate Islamic world .
<2en> We must therefore not hesitate to provide help to people in these countries in abolishing such mediaeval punishments and customs , if we can do so by means of diplomacy or in other ways .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , we absolutely should condemn the use of caning and all forms of corporal punishment and inhumane treatment .
<en> Malaysia cannot invoke its domestic legislation , under which at least 66 crimes carry the punishment of caning , in order to justify its ruthless methods , which are tantamount to torture and which are considered illegal by international law and conventions .
<en> Amnesty International reports of an increasing number of refugees and emigrants subjected to caning in Malaysian prisons are also alarming .
<en> The European Union , which has had more effective methods at its disposal to facilitate the protection of human rights since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , should show greater initiative in the fight against the brutal treatment of people throughout the world .
<en> Furthermore , the observance of human rights should be a key condition set by the European Union for the development of further political cooperation with Malaysia .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission , by Mrs Angelilli , on international adoption in the European Union - B7-0670 / 2010 ) .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , over the years , many of my fellow Members and I have become aware of the problem of abandoned children , orphans and street children .
<2en> Amongst the associations that contacted me was the Amici dell 'adozione .
<2en> There are many abandoned children , not only in the developing world , but also in Europe .
<2en> These are children who become invisible and end up in the vicious circle of poverty and social exclusion or , worse still , are exploited by organised crime for begging , illegal work , prostitution , organ trafficking or illegal adoptions .
<2en> Often , these children spend their youth shuttling between social workers and orphanages .
<2en> We must guarantee these children the right to be adopted and the right to have a family .
<2en> A child should spend as little time as possible in an institution .
<2en> Obviously , the aim is the best interests of the child , so the ability to be adopted must certainly be granted warily , under the scrupulous supervision of the competent domestic authorities .
<2en> However , where suitable conditions exist , children have the right to be adopted , above all at national level , but also at international level , within the European Union .
<2en> I know that the Commission is aware of this , even if it is a matter of purely national competence .
<2en> However , some sort of cooperation between the Commission and Member States would be desirable to ensure good practices and strategies capable of guaranteeing the utmost transparency and to prevent possible illegal and casual adoptions , but also to ensure the maximum level of cooperation from Member States in guaranteeing the right of adoption and preventing children from being abandoned to themselves or , as I said before , abandoned to an institution .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you for bringing forward this important question .
<en> The protection and promotion of children 's rights is a priority for the Commission , especially since the launch of the communication entitled ' Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child ' in 2006 .
<en> The strategy on the rights of the child focuses on the fundamental rights of children , including the protection of the best interests of the child as enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<en> The Commission is determined to ensure that all fundamental rights encompassed in the Charter are duly respected by all EU actions , both legislative and non-legislative .
<en> This practice will be upheld and further developed in the forthcoming communication on the rights of the child that the Commission will be publishing this year .
<en> As of this year , 2011 , the Commission will also be reporting annually on progress made on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<en> We have to remember that the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union , with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity , and to the Member States , only when they are implementing Union law .
<en> We therefore have to remember that , currently , no European Union legislation on international adoption exists .
<en> The subject is regulated by the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on protection of children and cooperation in respect of inter-country adoption , as well as by national laws .
<en> All the Member States are party to that Convention , but the EU is not .
<en> Its aim is to implement Article 21 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by establishing safeguards to ensure that inter-country adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and that the child 's fundamental rights are respected .
<en> Internationally , the Commission supports the accession of third countries to the 1993 Hague Convention on inter-country adoption and its correct implementation by participating in relevant meetings of the contracting parties .
<en> The Commission does not consider specific European rules on intra-EU adoptions to be necessary , as all 27 EU Member States are parties to the Hague Convention .
<en> That being said , the Commission is closely following the issue of international adoption within the European Union , given the link between adoption and children 's rights .
<en> The Commission has taken steps to see how countries are implementing the convention on adoption , and , in November 2009 , provided a forum for an exchange of views on the issue .
<en> The Commission 's Green Paper on the free circulation of public documents , published on 14 December 2010 , addresses the lack of mutual recognition of adoption decisions as civil status acts between Member States and its impact on the freedom of movement of EU citizens .
<en> This is a specific step which addresses the question raised today .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that the issue of international adoption is particularly important , and Mrs Angelilli has done well to bring it to the attention of the European Parliament in this sitting .
<2en> We need leaner , simplified procedures .
<2en> The current costs of adoption are particularly significant , ranging from EUR 20 000 to EUR 30 000 per adoption , and there are difficulties in providing a real response to the need for a family and for budding parents to become just that .
<2en> We are talking about vulnerable and often abandoned children who sometimes disappear from sight .
<2en> I am referring , in particular , to flows of illegal immigrants and the many children who , having been accommodated in immigration centres , are subjected to the disgraceful conditions of the slave trade , in which so many of them are often caught up .
<2en> We need to promote the family .
<2en> The Italian model , and that of other places , can be followed .
<2en> We need to cut the costs related to international adoption , provide favourable loans from banks , introduce those leaner , simplified procedures that I mentioned , with proper supervisory mechanisms for monitoring what is going on in the Member States , ensure real prevention of trafficking in human beings , on which Parliament recently intervened with a specific dossier , take real action to combat illegal adoptions , and ensure transparency .
<2en> What is more , if we want to restore the central role of the family - as we often say in this Chamber - we must make sure that the associations , which are very often the key vehicle of these adoptions , are characterised by particularly high standards of guarantee .
<2en> I would conclude , Commissioner Georgieva , by saying that if there is a suggestion to be made , then it is the following : why not provide a European system of accreditation for these associations , and ensure that they work transparently , clearly and practically , but with a high level of guarantees to truly protect the inalienable and inviolable rights of children ?
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we are talking here this evening about a very sensitive topic , since we are talking about the smallest members of society , about those who need our love and need our care .
<2en> The problem of abandoned children is becoming more serious in Europe .
<2en> The situation that has arisen today is , to a very large extent , due to immediate surroundings .
<2en> Through the law on adopting children in an international context , it is possible to avoid a situation where many children are forced to live in children 's homes , where , despite the enormous care they receive , they never feel the real love of a mother or a father 's caress .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to make the adoption system more effective , so that the youngest abandoned children can find a replacement family .
<2en> It is necessary , for example , to restrict the rights of biological parents who show no genuine interest in a child for a certain period of time .
<2en> This would shorten the period which a child spends in a children 's home , as the child is not , so to speak , legally free .
<2en> In this way , it would also be possible , to some extent , to eliminate unnecessary delays in the overall adoption process .
<2en> Many agreements on the protection of minors provide a legal framework for the efforts of the competent authorities to act for the benefit and in the interests of these children .
<2en> Protecting children 's rights is also one of the main aims of the European Union .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to continue taking appropriate steps to ensure , in particular , that the best interests of children are protected under all circumstances .

<en> The next item is Question Time ( B7-0009 / 2011 ) .
<en> The following questions are addressed to the Council .
<en> Subject : Rule of law in Serbia
<en> How does the Council view the development of the rule of law in Serbia , particularly in the light of the questionable court case against alleged guerrillas belonging to the Albanian minority in the Preševo valley in southern Serbia ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( HU ) The opinion of the Council on the development of the rule of law in Serbia is presented in the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010 .
<en> In these conclusions , the Council welcomes the fact that Serbia is continuing the implementation of its reform schedule and has shown further progress in implementing the provisions set out in the interim agreement signed with the European Union .
<en> In its conclusions , the Council also established that Serbia continues to achieve good results in the performance of its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
<en> However , the country needs to make further efforts , particularly in the following areas : the reform of public administration , the rule of law , including the reform of the justice system , the fight against corruption and organised crime , and the improvement of its business environment .
<en> The Council did not discuss the development of the rule of law in Serbia with regard to the specific procedure referred to by Mr Posselt .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Since I submitted the question , a group of Serbian citizens of Albanian nationality have been given the maximum sentences in a show trial by a special court where they stood accused of crimes in Kosovo .
<en> Should this not have been dealt with by the European Union Rule of Law Mission ( EULEX ) instead of Serbia ?
<en> Could you please look into this and find out about the specific case that I have asked about ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( HU ) Thank you very much , Mr Posselt .
<en> Please note that the so-called accession criteria laid down in 1993 by the European Council in Copenhagen are decisive considerations with regard to the position of the Council on any enlargements and stabilisation and association agreements .
<en> These criteria also include respect for human and minority rights , and nothing can be more important to the Council during the negotiations than this principle .
<en> What I can tell you is that the Hungarian Presidency , representing the Council , will naturally acknowledge your request and the issue , is aware of the gravity of these events , and , as in all accession and association agreement procedures , is paying special attention to these matters in this case as well .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I have another supplementary question for the Council with regard to the Mr Posselt 's question .
<en> My colleague has already asked whether the Council can envisage , in this specific case in particular , contacting the government and those responsible on the ground once again .
<en> Therefore , I would again like to ask the Presidency of the Council : Can the Presidency envisage , in this specific case , entering into contact with the people responsible on the ground ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is Question Time ( B7-0019 / 2011 ) .
<en> Before I start Question Time , because we are so late , I want to say a couple of things about the manner in which I will be conducting Question Time .
<en> I would be grateful if everybody would pay attention , including , if I may ask politely , the Commissioners who will be responding .
<en> I will take , by way of supplementary questions , only the author of the question because we do not have enough time to do more if we are to get through enough questions .
<en> I would ask the Commissioners who are responding or delivering their first answer not , please , to read us a long essay .
<en> We would like a very nice answer and an informative answer to our question , so that you can have some dialogue with the questioner .
<en> The following questions are addressed to the Commission .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , I must admit that I support your arguments about the time available .
<en> However , I would like to ask you to take one thing into account .
<en> The Members who want to ask questions are not the ones who are responsible for the fact that we are running so late .
<en> My problem is that I put a question to the Council concerning a matter which will now be dealt with as Question No 2 .
<en> My question to the Council was identical to this , but Question Time with the Council has now been cancelled , without a replacement .
<en> This is , of course , rather unfortunate , and I would like to ask you to review your otherwise completely logical and understandable approach with regard to this one question .
<sp>
<en> I have no alternative in the circumstances we find ourselves in tonight .
<en> I am very sorry for all the questioners , but the best I can do is to get through as many questions as possible and let questioners have their moment .
<en> It is not a position I relish , and you will know , I think , that we are taking steps to move to a new more real form of Question Time to reflect the new situation we find ourselves in after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> The sooner that happens , frankly the better , but let us now proceed .
<en> Part one
<en> Subject : Framework directive on minimum income in the EU
<en> Last year , Parliament adopted a report on the role of minimum income in combating poverty and promoting an inclusive society in Europe , in which it maintained that a minimum income should be guaranteed in the EU under a framework directive .
<en> Given that there are already more than 85 million people in Europe living below the poverty line , does the Commission not consider it necessary to draw up a framework directive on a scheme to guarantee a sufficient minimum income in Europe as a whole ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - People have often said that societies should be judged by the way they treat their weakest members .
<en> Clearly , if we fail to provide adequate support for persons in need , we are likely to exclude them even further , and so make it harder to integrate them into society and bring them onto the labour market .
<en> The Commission believes that , in addition to acting as automatic stabilisers , minimum income schemes can play an important role in protecting the most vulnerable from the worst effects of the crisis by providing safety nets .
<en> The Commission recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market and the EPSCO Council Conclusions of 17 December 2008 on common active inclusion principles to combat poverty more effectively both highlight the importance of access to adequate resources , alongside quality services and inclusive labour markets .
<en> The recommendation calls on the Member States in particular to ' recognise the individual 's basic right to resources and social assistance sufficient to lead a life that is compatible with human dignity as part of a comprehensive , consistent drive to combat social exclusion ' .
<en> The approach outlined in the recommendation has proved to be a step in the right direction , especially during the economic crisis .
<en> But more needs to be done to fully implement active inclusion reforms .
<en> As the Commission announced in its communication on the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion , it will report in 2012 on the implementation of the common principles on active inclusion , focusing , inter alia , on the effectiveness of minimum income schemes .
<en> It will propose action based on that assessment , including ways in which EU financial instruments could support active inclusion .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) Madam President , Commissioner , thank you for your reply , but you did not answer my question .
<en> My question was worded thus - does the European Commission intend to initiate a framework directive on ensuring sufficient minimum incomes , because otherwise , we definitely will not overcome poverty .
<en> Even last year , during the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion , poverty grew in individual Member States .
<en> Commissioner , one other point - since a really high number of elderly people are falling into poverty , how would you feel about the Commission initiating uniform criteria as regards a minimum pension at European Union level ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Madam President , the economic crisis has demonstrated that the service sectors are far more vulnerable than industrial policy , and Europe must therefore once again focus on the latter .
<en> I therefore very much welcome both the attitude of Commissioner Tajani and the report of our colleague , Mr Bernd Lange , on this subject .
<en> It has been a pleasure working on this report .
<en> Every one of the participants wanted to add something to it .
<en> We were not arguing about what the difficulties were , but rather about how we could accelerate this process .
<en> It is imperative that we understand that the European Union must play a leading role in setting its own goals , and also in pulling the Member States along on this road .
<en> The European Union must coordinate , lead and hold the Member States to account for what they have achieved in this area .
<en> Industrial policy provides Europe with the opportunity to gain a competitive advantage in manufacturing industries , biotechnology , nanotechnology , the chemical industry , or even in fields related to the aerospace industry .
<en> We must understand that in the industrial policy of the 21st century , the intensity of knowledge and the efficiency of material use are increasing .
<en> At the same time , we must strengthen vertical relationships , from education to research to market opportunities .
<en> Supplier relations , including small and medium-sized enterprises , as well as horizontal relations , must be established .
<en> We believe that social dialogue cannot be circumvented .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , this report on industrial policy , on which we will vote tomorrow , includes a point that will not be supported by the Spanish Members because it welcomes enhanced cooperation as an appropriate legal instrument for the establishment of a single EU patent .
<en> It is not only the Spanish Members , but also others from different Member States who , firstly , call into question the legality of enhanced cooperation as an appropriate legal instrument in this case , and , secondly , condemn the failure to observe the rule of unanimity , which should be applied to all issues relating to the rules governing languages .
<en> However , my reason for asking to speak , Madam President , was to draw Parliament 's attention to Opinion 1 / 09 published today by the Court of Justice of the European Union , which states that the European and Community Patent Court , as is currently being proposed , is not compatible with the Treaties .
<en> The clear position expressed by Court of Justice is a considerable obstacle to this enhanced cooperation , and I hope this decision will encourage other Members to join us in order to defend the equality of all Member States and the rigorous application of EU primary law .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report on the industrial policy is thorough , examines all the weaknesses in the system , and points us in the direction of respect for the principles of the social market economy .
<en> Realistically , however , we have to accept that Europe has not had its own industrial policy so far .
<en> In fact , productivity in the manufacturing sector in Europe is going through difficult times , while emerging countries are not only growing but also investing heavily in research and technology .
<en> To make industry and employment grow in Europe , we need to deploy special measures in addition to the current rules , even to the extent of reviewing the distribution of competences between the Member States and the Union .
<en> Redistribution policies and systems also need to be reviewed in line with a new cultural approach to industrial relations , with the company profit-sharing model at the focus of our reflections .
<en> The Europe 2020 strategy sets out goals that the European Union cannot afford to miss and , if it is to achieve all the targets set , Europe must overcome the challenge of industrial growth by strengthening training and research in support of small and medium-sized enterprises .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important report .
<en> It is good to see that industry is back on Europe 's agenda .
<en> I think that what we need is a balanced European economy .
<en> I speak mainly on agriculture and food policy , but I was moved to participate in this debate because I think talking about industry and agriculture and services is really important .
<en> Europe needs a balance of all three and not to recognise that would be very foolish .
<en> I want , in particular , to draw attention to paragraph 112 , which talks about free trade being the cornerstone of Europe 's economic growth , but also talks about fair global competition and , in particular , urges that , when we come to do bilateral trade agreements or multilateral agreements , we must take account of the principles of sustainable development , social and environmental concerns and relevant standards in those agreements .
<en> Those of us on the agriculture side would say the very same .
<en> So I think this is an important report on all fronts .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , one of the decisive factors affecting industrial growth in the European Union is the trend towards a ' green economy ' .
<en> This is good news .
<en> However , the way in which the current EU regulations operate is blind and arbitrary , resulting in the opposite effect , or , in other words , limiting our progress towards this goal .
<en> The European copper industry has become an example of such an adverse impact .
<en> There can be no question about the fact that both the Climate and Energy Package and the benchmarks directive will cause a drop in the production of copper , which , as we all know , is a metal which is in great demand for innovative and energy-efficient technologies , particularly in relation to electricity transmission and heat transfer in heat exchangers .
<en> I would like to ask the Commissioner whether it is not time - while we still have time - at least to revise certain aspects of these regulations , and to stop these destructive measures ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , we must not forget , in this debate , that we are dealing with a simplified Treaty revision pursuant to Article 136 and that we , as Parliament - in connection with whatever mechanisms - are supposed to be more heavily involved .
<en> That is the starting point .
<en> A wish list has been put forward in this regard .
<en> I would like to give my specific backing to Mr Brok when he says that the participation of the Commission and of Parliament must be envisaged .
<en> That is why we are having this debate and will not be taking a decision until 24 March , in order to give the Council the chance to actually bring about that participation in reality .
<en> The full inclusion of the Commission throws up questions , as the Commission has failed , in the past , to observe its obligation to act as guardian of the Treaties by failing to instigate proceedings .
<en> The Member States themselves have likewise failed to observe their obligations .
<en> It is therefore imperative that , in this simplified Treaty revision , we take a new step towards completing economic and monetary union .
<en> I also have an idea of how that can be brought about , which is for the Commission to prepare everything - including proposals and drafts - on behalf of the Council , and the Council to then be obliged , much like in the monetary dialogue that we have with the independent European Central Bank , to report to us here and discuss matters with us .
<en> That would be a sensible approach .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Mr President , from a legal perspective , the amendment to the agreement is essential for the introduction of a fixed Eurobond .
<en> It is also undoubtedly necessary to introduce a euro area stability mechanism .
<en> A mutual assistance mechanism , if properly set up , can bind the Union together and lead to greater integration and solidarity between Member States .
<en> However , we should definitely not stop there .
<en> If the mechanism is to be significant , coordination must be improved in the economic area , but also in the area of social policies .
<en> At the same time , I consider the intention to establish a stability mechanism outside the system of European institutions to be a bad signal .
<en> The intergovernmental or even private-law nature of the proposed mechanism may put the European integration project back several years .
<en> I would therefore like to call not only on the Commission , but especially on Member State representatives , to abandon such ideas .
<en> If we are to exploit the crisis at least in some positive way , then we must see it as a chance to mobilise and not to split apart .
<en> The establishment and operation of a permanent stability mechanism should happen in the closest possible connection with the framework of the EU , and should involve the institutional procedures of enhanced cooperation .
<en> I would like to end by expressing the hope that only the good signals from the submitted proposal will come to fruition .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , we are amending the Treaty of Lisbon , which , in fact , we only recently adopted .
<en> Perhaps this should cause us to consider whether the Treaty , which was so greatly trumpeted and said to be a panacea for all of Europe 's problems , has nevertheless proved basically to be completely overrated .
<en> Of course , the crisis , which is , at the moment , a problem for the Union , requires very resolute action .
<en> Only there is a question as to whether what the Commission and the Council are proposing really is a good solution .
<en> This is not only a matter of the euro area , because it is going to affect countries which are outside the area .
<en> What is more , those countries - and that includes my own country , Poland - are basically going to have decisions imposed on them which were made without their involvement .
<en> This is not a good signal for the citizens , who were once told that the Treaty of Lisbon would be a panacea for every problem .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I have three points .
<en> Firstly , deficits are not caused by currencies .
<en> They are caused by governments and overspending .
<en> I think that is perhaps bad news for Mr Bloom , who spoke here earlier , because if he was right and the responsibility was that of the currencies , that would be extremely bad news for the pound or the dollar , where we have the biggest deficits globally today .
<en> The responsibility lies with governments .
<en> That is why it is important that we secure and structure the stability mechanism in a way that helps Member States get out of difficulties , but also helps to ensure that Member States do not get into difficulties .
<en> That is why I think it is important that the financing of the stability mechanism is structured in such a way that those who are exposing us to bigger risks by having bigger deficits should be obliged to pay more in order to contribute to the mechanism .
<en> Then you have some kind of ' polluter pays ' principle and you also have a preventive action in the stability mechanism , contributing to the stability of the euro as such .
<en> That is why I think we need not only to discuss the formal structure of the stability mechanism , but also how we finance it .
<en> We need to secure stability in a long-term perspective as well as in the short-term perspective .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) I can summarise my position in three points .
<en> Firstly , the idea of a permanent stability mechanism for the euro in itself constitutes a vital contribution to strengthening the single currency , to greater monetary integration in the EU , and to making the public debt markets more stable .
<en> We should therefore support it unreservedly .
<en> Secondly , the permanent stability mechanism can only be created with security and legal certainty if it is included in the Treaties in a clear way .
<en> We should therefore support the careful amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
<en> Thirdly , it would obviously be preferable if the aforementioned mechanism were created and managed by the European institutions themselves , rather than emerging as an intergovernmental initiative for the euro area .
<en> Nonetheless , we are well aware that this is impossible in the face of insurmountable objections from certain Member States , and it only takes one such objection for the amendment to the Treaty not to be passed .
<en> We should therefore support the Council 's proposal for the amendments of the Treaty as it is .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the volcanic ash crisis last year prompted the cancellation of close to 100 000 flights , resulting in absolute chaos for passengers .
<en> It is the effect that this crisis had on passengers that I wish to draw the Commission 's attention to today .
<en> Over 10 million people were affected and the cancellations resulted in significant economic costs for thousands of passengers .
<en> While airports have signs and leaflets informing travellers of their rights , this is often of little use when faced with cancellations or major travel disruptions such as that caused by the ash cloud .
<en> Under EU legislation , passengers have a right to information and assistance from their airline .
<en> However , in reality , the majority of passengers whose travel has been disrupted will spend a lot of time and money chasing down information , seeking alternative tickets or compensation with airlines .
<en> This is an issue that the Commission needs be more effective on .
<en> The biggest frustration that passengers face in situations like this is trying to get information , trying to get in contact with the airlines .
<en> Although they are aware of their rights , this is of little help to them if they are stranded in an airport or on hold to an airline .
<en> While I appreciate that , at the time of the ash crisis , airlines were under unprecedented pressure to deal with thousands of passengers - and I must admit that some did admirably - in general , it is very difficult for people to get information and assistance when it is needed .
<en> The travel chaos as a result of the bad weather in December 2010 further demonstrates this .
<en> Passengers require up-to-date information but they need to be able to reach the airlines in order to exercise their rights .
<en> Airlines , airport customer services and information need to be more accessible to passengers whose travel has been disrupted .
<en> It is not enough to inform European Union citizens of their passenger rights ; they must be assisted in exercising them in times of travel chaos .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , this was a natural disaster which had terrible consequences for many people .
<en> However , if we compare it with the floods and the simultaneous hurricane in Australia or with the earthquake in Christchurch in New Zealand , we all escaped unharmed .
<en> Safety had absolute priority , and rightly so .
<en> Commissioner Kallas made the right decision in agreement with the EU transport ministers in the Member States .
<en> I cannot understand the criticism directed at the airlines .
<en> They clearly suffered a loss - a figure of 2 billion was mentioned .
<en> However , it is wrong to lay the responsibility as to whether or not flights go ahead at the feet of the airlines .
<en> That decision must be made at a political level .
<en> Safety must be given top priority .
<en> Imagine if an aeroplane had crashed as a result of the volcanic ash .
<en> We would have had a completely different debate , namely , how irresponsible it was to even allow one aeroplane to take off .
<en> We need a plan B , as has quite rightly been said , and the rail system is the alternative .
<en> As a result of their exemption from fuel tax , airlines receive EUR 30 billion per year from European taxpayers .
<en> This money must be invested in the rail system , at least in parts of it , so that we have an alternative in the event of this sort of disaster .
<en> Safety first - that is what people are calling for , and rightly so .
<en> It must also be the case in the future , too .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , this situation showed that Europe was not , in fact , prepared for this crisis .
<en> Despite what we are hearing in this Chamber , the experts say that the reaction on our part was excessive and some flights could certainly have been allowed .
<en> However , this nonetheless shows the undoubted scale of the paralysis in which we found ourselves .
<en> Of course , the previous speakers who spoke about a certain alternative in the form of developing the rail network are right .
<en> That is obvious .
<en> In the field of aviation , the answer to this problem is definitely better coordination and strengthening of the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency .
<en> In addition , it is good that in November , the European Parliament adopted a suitable regulation on this matter .
<en> It was a step in the right direction .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , the volcanic eruption forces us to rethink transportation priorities .
<en> The time has come to begin favouring rail in medium-distance transport up to 1 500 km , for which subsidies , taxes , and other regulatory mechanisms could be used as needed .
<en> An important consideration is that significant internal market demand is noticeable in connection with the modernisation of railroad tracks as well as the manufacturing of rolling stock , both of which could create numerous jobs .
<en> In view of check-in and airport transfer times , aeroplanes - in comparison with high-speed trains - provide a zero minimal time benefit while causing considerable carbon dioxide and noise pollution .
<en> Even though we cannot prevent volcanic eruptions , we can improve the technology used to predict them and how we evaluate the resulting situation .
<en> However , a genuine solution can only be provided by transforming transport , energy and industrial policy , because volcanic eruptions cause either no disruption , or only local disruption , to rail transport .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as many of us have said just now , the eruption of the Icelandic volcano last April was a painful illustration of the fragmentation and ineffectiveness of the European sky .
<en> Each of us in this Chamber was directly affected .
<en> Five million of our citizens were stranded with no real alternative form of transport available .
<en> One year after that exceptional event , new European measures have so far failed to materialise .
<en> Commissioner , you said that a first crisis exercise , linked to volcanic ash , is scheduled for 13 and 14 April under the coordination of Eurocontrol , the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) and the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) , but it is essential that the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) exercises real leadership to coordinate safety measures at European level .
<en> It is certain that the information provided by the Visual Approach Charts ( VAC ) of London and Toulouse must be refined using more modern technologies .
<en> As we saw last April , however , the data may be contradictory and may lead each Member State to take decisions concerning the closure of their air space that are motivated less by information than by emotion .
<en> In this context , the role of the EASA is vital in proposing a harmonised interpretation of the data , as well as in ensuring the centralisation and proper dissemination of the information .
<en> Beyond the information provided by the VACs , the EASA must put in place a mechanism for collecting the available data in close cooperation with the Member States , the airlines and their pilots .
<en> This centralisation of information and the coordination of all those involved will prevent the chaos and the inconsistencies we witnessed last year .
<en> So I expect the Commission , together with the EASA , to be able to submit specific proposals in the very near future , which will be integrated fully in the implementation of the Single European Sky .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I believe that it does not make any sense for Parliament to deliver an opinion on this issue at a time when all guarantees of freedom of expression have been given , including by the Hungarian Prime Minister , Mr Orbán .
<2en> Moreover , this is a question of principle , so I shall refrain from appraising political , legislative and jurisdictional acts that lie strictly within the competence of the legislative , executive and judicial authorities of a Member State other than my own .
<sp>
<2en> Freedom of expression and information , including the freedom to express opinions and the freedom to receive and communicate information without interference or pressure , are social values which many have fought for over the years , including in Portugal .
<2en> The Communists have been , and are now , in the front line of this fight .
<2en> Unfortunately , there are still reasons to continue with it in various EU countries .
<2en> The pluralism and freedom of the media continue to provoke concern in various Member States .
<2en> It is often forgotten that some of the contributing factors for this are the way in which the ownership of media bodies is concentrated in a handful of large business groups , the attack on the rights of media professionals and the existence of increasingly precarious working relationships .
<2en> Added to this , there is interference by the political powers that still exist in many countries , and which is a cause for concern .
<sp>
<2en> Freedom of expression and information , with the resulting pluralism of the media , including the freedom to express opinions and to receive and communicate information without any kind of interference or pressure from the public authorities , has been achieved by civilisation .
<2en> Unfortunately , however , in various countries in the EU , we often see attacks on these fundamental rights .
<2en> The pluralism and freedom of the media continue to provoke concern in various Member States , particularly in Hungary , Italy , Bulgaria , Romania , Estonia , and others .
<2en> Even in Portugal , several cases have been reported of attacks on media pluralism , which do nothing to dignify democracy .
<2en> However , we disagree that there is a policy of permanent political interference by the EU in the governance of each country , as stated in certain paragraphs .
<2en> We voted on the resolution on media law in Hungary in view of this , taking its positive and negative aspects into account .
<sp>
<2en> I am convinced that a very broad majority in the European Parliament will uphold the fundamental rights of the media .
<2en> These rights are now being called for in a resolution , although the amendments to this law which were adopted this week in the Hungarian Parliament have not been taken into account .
<2en> I would therefore have liked all resolutions that were drawn up before this vote in Budapest to be withdrawn in order for them first to be updated and only then to be debated and put to the vote .
<2en> Consequently , the vote in the European Parliament no longer had anything to do with freedom of the press , which should have absolutely priority , but was simply a trial of strength between the groups .
<sp>
<2en> I fully endorse the adoption of this resolution from the European left criticising the inadequacy of the amendments made by Hungary to its media law , while the right welcomes them .
<2en> Though Mrs Kroes also seems satisfied with these changes , the European Parliament considers that the Commission only focused on a few technical aspects to the detriment of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<2en> Also , not only is our resolution addressed to Hungary but notes that , unfortunately , freedom and pluralism of the media can be undermined in countries with conservative governments .
<2en> In this sense , the Members of the European Parliament have demonstrated that they are mindful that fundamental rights and liberties , which are the very principles of the democracies and of the European Union , must be respected .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution , because I consider that women play a huge role and make a huge contribution to rural and agricultural development .
<2en> Support for women and their business plans in the rural sector will help the entire rural community to progress considerably .
<2en> In the midst of an economic crisis and with galloping unemployment , we must provide incentives to keep women of all ages in the countryside , to support female entrepreneurship and to invest in their training , in order to achieve development and innovation in the agricultural sector .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Jeggle for this excellent report , which highlights the extremely important role played by women in agriculture .
<2en> I am aware that many of us would like women of every age to remain in the countryside , or we believe that we need to encourage them to move there to ensure the future of rural areas and agriculture in Europe .
<2en> However , in order to facilitate this , we have to improve women 's access to education and training in the agricultural sector and allow them to gain better access to direct payments .
<2en> On the other hand , we must ensure they have access to decent pensions and social insurance .
<2en> In Romania , for example , some women living in the countryside are not eligible for farmer pensions and find it very difficult to start a business in the agricultural sector .
<2en> This is why it is paramount that we focus more attention on women working on family or subsistence farms and guarantee them both a decent living and adequate pensions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I endorsed the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas .
<en> In particular , I am in favour of solutions aimed at increasing levels of employment among women in rural areas .
<en> In Poland there are more women who are unemployed than men , particularly in rural areas .
<en> A large percentage of those without work in rural areas are women under the age of 34 .
<en> In the majority of cases these are educated women , who cannot find work appropriate to their qualifications .
<en> This is a particularly dangerous trend , since it is young people who should be given greater opportunities to gain a foothold in the labour market .
<en> In the long term , this results in the feminisation of unemployment in rural areas , and thus in higher levels of poverty among young women .
<en> Many of them decide to move to towns to look for work , which in turn leads to an ageing of the rural population , a drop in the natural growth rate and a general deterioration of living conditions for residents of rural areas .
<en> In connection with this , I support the proposal whereby provision should be made in the new EAFRD regulation for special funding aimed at supporting women in the future 2014-2020 programming period .
<en> This may have a positive effect on levels of employment among women in rural areas .
<en> I am also in favour of ensuring appropriate benefits for women living in rural areas , within the framework of social security systems .
<en> These benefits must take into account the fact that women have less earning power and that this affects their pension entitlements .

<en> in writing . - ( PL ) As a result of social and demographic developments , changing value systems and a wider range of choice , the structure of rural areas is changing .
<en> The role of women in rural areas is also changing .
<en> What is now needed , in order to ensure that women remain in rural areas , or to encourage them to choose a rural lifestyle , is to take greater account of their needs and make sure that these needs are reflected in our support policy .
<en> We should ensure that women are more visible in rural areas , particular in the economic and financial spheres , and we should make instruments available to achieve these tasks .
<en> In view of the fact that it is still women who take care of young children and sick and elderly people , giving up work to do so , we should make it possible for them to achieve a balance between family life and professional life .
<en> This is possible by means of infrastructure development , for example , by building nurseries and developing various educational and cultural options .
<en> The key to achieving these aims will be to include women of all generations in decision-making processes .
<en> It is also of the utmost importance to improve access to medical services and cancer screening programmes for women .
<en> Furthermore , it is still worth supporting and developing agritourism as a low-risk form of economic activity which fosters job creation and work-life balance , and promoting electronic forms of entrepreneurship , such as e-commerce , which make it possible to be economically active regardless of how far you are from urban centres .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The EPLP supports the aim of Elisabeth Jeggle 's report ' Role of Women in agriculture and rural areas ' to highlight the sector specific problems faced by women working in agriculture and many of the measures proposed to strengthen their position .
<en> The report addresses the specific needs of women working in agriculture , by proposing a series of recommendations which take account both of their living conditions and their role and contribution to the development of the rural economy .
<en> However , the EPLP does not agree with the Paragraph 4 , which speaks against further reducing the proportion of the total budget accounted by agricultural expenditure .
<en> We would like to see significant reprioritisation within the Multiannual Financial Framework to fully fund Europe 2020 priorities that have the greatest impact on raising employment and growth levels .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report provides a statistical summary about irregularities reported by the Member States in those areas where they implement the budget ( agricultural policy , cohesion policy and pre-accession funds , i.e. around 80 % of the budget ) and about the collection of the EU 's traditional own resources .
<2en> I think that the protection of the EU 's financial interests and the fight against fraud are especially important areas , and responsibility for them comes under the remit of both the European Union and Member States .
<2en> The report also gives an estimate of the irregularities which have occurred regarding expenditure managed directly by the Commission , as well as an overview of the operational activities of the European Anti-Fraud Office ( OLAF ) .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report , which strongly criticises the Commission for providing too little information on fraud and irregularities .
<en> This is considered a result of bad reporting by Member States .
<en> The fraud rates in France and Spain are , for example , considered ' suspiciously low ' .
<en> In future , we want to see a clear division between irregularities and fraud , given that fraud is a criminal offence , whereas an irregularity is a failure to comply with a rule .
<en> The report also asks for a breakdown of estimated fraud and irregularities for each Member State so that disciplinary action can be taken against individual countries .
<en> Large amounts of EU funding is still spent incorrectly , says the resolution .
<en> Parliament calls on the Commission to take action to ensure prompt recovery of those funds , especially in Italy .
<en> In agriculture and cohesion policy in particular , the rate of recovery of outstanding amounts is ' catastrophic ' .
<sp>
<2en> I share the view of the rapporteur that the Commission failed to provide much-needed information in its report on the protection of the Communities ' financial interests and the fight against fraud , even regarding the estimated level of fraud and irregularities in individual EU Member States , in connection with the management of EU funds .
<2en> In view of what may , without exaggeration , be termed the gigantic scale of corruption in some Member States , including the Czech Republic , this is a very serious shortcoming .
<2en> If we look at fraud and so-called irregularities at Union level , there is usually ' only ' a specific segment of corruption and fraud in general at the level of individual Member States , but it is nevertheless a very substantial segment .
<2en> In my view , there is an urgent need to consider whether the work currently carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office is sufficiently effective , and whether that work should not undergo structural and methodology-related changes , including a more aggressive approach .
<sp>
<2en> ' Protection of the Communities ' financial interests ' groups together the fight against fraud and irregularities .
<2en> It is important to make a distinction between irregularity , or failure to comply with a rule , and fraud , or purposeful wrongdoing , which is a criminal offence .
<2en> In other words , the Committee 's report does not fully make this distinction and deals extensively with irregularities while failing to explore cases of fraud in any great detail .
<2en> Three areas , representing around 80 % of the EU budget , are singled out : agricultural policy , cohesion policy and pre-accession funds .
<2en> The implementation of these policies and of expenditure depends on Member States , which are responsible for the national tools for the fight against irregularities and fraud .
<2en> The commitment of administrations is too heterogeneous and the high level of outstanding irregularities in some Member States is not acceptable .
<2en> Improvements are also expected in public procurement procedures , especially in terms of ensuring transparency and combating fraud .
<sp>
<2en> This report highlights the number of irregularities and fraud cases in the spending of EU funds in each Member State .
<2en> The increase in the number of reported cases was caused by the introduction of new communication technologies .
<2en> I believe that everything must be done to place responsibility on and penalise the Member States with regard to fraud and irregularities .
<2en> The necessary information on each Member State must be made available so as to increase the effectiveness of control and monitoring systems , and to ensure that we have a true picture of the situation .
<2en> The Member States should introduce the Irregularity Management System in order to develop improvements in fulfilling their reporting obligations to the European institutions .
<2en> Agriculture , cohesion policy and pre-accession funds are areas where rates of irregularity and fraud are particularly pronounced .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to take measures to increase monitoring , detection and correction .
<2en> We have to concern ourselves with creating a transparent and effective system for managing and spending EU funds .

<en> ( IT ) Mr President , this is not a point of order ; I simply could not understand what you just said .
<en> If I am right , Mr de Magistris has requested the defence of his immunity .
<en> There must be some misunderstanding .
<en> Since Mr de Magistris is the champion of the battle against immunity in my country , it was probably misinterpreted .
<en> I think it unlikely that Mr de Magistris would have requested the defence of his immunity .
<en> I must have misunderstood and I should therefore like some clarification on this matter .

<en> in writing . - I voted to give discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addicition and , in doing so , welcome the fact that the Centre has further enhanced the annual forecast of its cash needs ; notes that this forecast is constantly updated and submitted as a supporting document to the relevant Commission services to justify the Centre 's quarterly request for payment of the next instalment of its annual subsidy allocated by the Union .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Taking into account the Court of Auditors ' report on the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) for the financial year 2009 , together with the EMCDDA 's replies , I voted for this decision , which grants the Executive Director of the EMCDDA discharge in respect of the implementation of the EMCDDA budget for the financial year 2009 .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This grants the Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre 's budget for the financial year 2009 .
<sp>
<2en> Through today 's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction discharge in respect of the implementation of the Centre 's budget for the financial year 2009 .
<2en> Parliament welcomes the Centre 's initiative to run a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction .
<2en> Parliament notes that this network connects national drug information networks , specialist centres in the Member States and the information systems of international organisations working with the Centre .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I voted in favour of the discharge .
<en> The annual accounts for 2009 were found to be regular .
<en> The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) has been exemplary in the way it administers its budget .
<en> The Monitoring Centre has already presented a table comparing financial years 2008 and 2009 - not just the figures ( which show a 2.25 % reduction in funds compared with 2008 ) , but also the measures implemented .
<en> To fully ensure transparency the EMCDDA wishes to present the full report from the Internal Audit Service .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to say a very big thank you for the excellent compromise that we have reached .
<2en> The rapporteur , Mr Manders , in particular has done some sterling work and he ensured that we experienced truly excellent cooperation here in the European Parliament .
<2en> We have come a long way since the Commission tabled its original proposal .
<2en> It was a mainly technical proposal and it was one that only contained benefits for businesses .
<2en> Fortunately , however , by working on the proposal here in the European Parliament , we succeeded in incorporating elements that make this legislation beneficial for consumers , too .
<2en> I believe that this is absolutely crucial .
<2en> As a result , we will have better labelling and a higher level of safety for consumers once we have finally implemented this legislation .
<2en> The most important aspect for me and for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was to ensure that the textiles that are sold on the Internal Market do not cause health problems .
<2en> We are therefore very pleased that the requirement for there to be no residues of hazardous substances in our textiles that could give rise to allergies was successfully voted through - and , as the Commissioner has just said , that we are to have a study carried out to ensure that this is the case .
<2en> This is absolutely vital and it is something that we in the S & D Group are very pleased about .
<2en> We also agree that traceability and origin are extremely important , and this is also the type of information that consumers are very keen to have .
<2en> Personally , I also hope that we can achieve a little bit more than this and that we might also be able to have harmonised clothes sizes and use new technologies in our labelling of textiles in the future .
<2en> I do think that we have achieved a great deal , however .
<2en> It should be a lesson for us that , when we lay down legislation here in the EU , it is important for it to benefit both businesses and consumers at the same time .
<2en> That is the best way to ensure that we have a well-functioning Internal Market .
<2en> I would like to finish by expressing my sincere thanks once again to all my fellow Members for their outstanding cooperation .
<2en> I think we have achieved a very good result .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( RO ) Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate our rapporteur Toine Manders for the fine job he has done and for the perseverance he has shown in the negotiations with the Council on this proposal for a regulation .
<en> I welcome the agreement which has been reached with the Council at second reading .
<en> I believe that this is an agreement which , although it can be improved , will boost the competitiveness of the textile industry , while at the same time providing consumers with better information .
<en> This agreement has a large number of positive points .
<en> Firstly , the procedure for including new fibres in Annex I has been simplified .
<en> This will help reduce the administrative costs for the textile industry and allow this money to be reallocated to innovation .
<en> This measure will also benefit consumers as innovation is encouraged .
<en> I also think that this regulation will offer benefits to consumers due to the labelling requirements .
<en> Providing consumers with sufficient information so that they can make an enlightened choice is a completely natural step .
<en> The discussions about the labelling have lasted longer than the Commission initially proposed .
<en> However , I think that this can only benefit European consumers .
<en> I agree that we need more time to evaluate the impact of some additional labelling requirements , especially regarding origin , the care treatment method and the introduction of a harmonised size labelling system .
<en> This is why the study carried out by the Commission marks a first step forward .
<en> Finally , I believe that the labelling requirement for non-textile parts of animal origin is a sign of real progress as it is consumers who do not want the textile products they buy to contain such materials .
<en> I think that , as a whole , this regulation will help deepen the single market for textiles , a move which I fully endorse .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , simplifying the binding legal framework in respect of the labelling of textile products is intended to encourage the development of new textiles and their introduction onto the market .
<2en> The proposal we will vote on tomorrow differs significantly from that put forward by the European Commission , which mainly consisted in technical changes simplifying legislation already in force .
<2en> The original aim of the report was to speed up the procedure for registering the names of new textiles , in order to provide effective support for innovation in the European textile and clothing industry , while at the same time making it possible for consumers to benefit more rapidly from modern products .
<2en> Despite the fact that work on the simplification of procedures has slowed down during the more than two years spent on this dossier , I would note that Parliament proposed extending the original scope of the regulation , in particular to include provisions concerning the country of origin of textile products , so I am glad that a balanced compromise has been reached .
<2en> I would point out , however , that my group decided to approve the proposal in its initial version , which provides rapid benefits for business and consumers .
<2en> We proposed right from the start that work on these issues should not take place in the context of the technical report .
<2en> The Commission will therefore be asked to carry out a more in-depth analysis of the issue of mandatory ' made in ' labels for textile products manufactured outside the EU , and by 2013 it will produce a report on the possible launch of a system for country-of-origin labelling for products .
<2en> This report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal .
<2en> The compromise between Parliament and the Council also guarantees that labels on clothing products will provide information regarding the use of materials of animal origin .
<2en> If work is to be carried out in future on new opportunities for informing consumers about textile products , for example Europe-wide size harmonisation or RFID technology , let us remember to take a pragmatic approach , in line with consumers ' expectations and what industry can achieve .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , we say that consumer power is important , and if we are serious about this we clearly must also give consumers the opportunity to use their power .
<2en> We must ensure that they have adequate product information etc. to be able to make wise and informed choices .
<2en> I would therefore like to thank our rapporteur , Mr Manders , in particular for his persistence and commitment to ensure that the report includes the consumer perspective .
<2en> I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , who have shown a great deal of commitment to increasing consumer power .
<2en> As shadow rapporteur , I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left concerning origin labelling , mandatory labelling of animal products and ethical and environmental labelling .
<2en> It has not all been included , but I am very pleased with the compromise that we now have and I would like to express my support for it .
<2en> There is a lack of information when it comes to chemicals and various products used in textile manufacture .
<2en> The Commission has promised to carry out a study of this , and I would simply like to emphasise how very important it is that we have such a study done in order to be able to protect public health and combat allergies , among other things , in which we have seen a significant increase .
<2en> We need to be able to see , and , where present , substantiate the connections that exist .
<2en> I am also pleased that parts of textile products of animal origin are also to be labelled , and I wanted to use my speaking time to say thank you to everyone for their excellent work to increase consumer power .
<2en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the measure in question is designed to replace three obsolete directives and relates to the labelling of textile products entering the European Union and the registration and naming of the substances they are made of .
<2en> A text was adopted at first reading which called for labels to indicate the place of origin as well as a complete and mandatory list of the product 's composition .
<2en> Unfortunately , the Council 's position appears to contradict the text approved by Parliament since , in particular , it is against any reference to origin marking and the introduction of traceability in textile product labelling .
<2en> Just to get the measure approved at the second reading , the Internal Market and Consumer Protection ( IMCO ) Committee has agreed to a text which does not satisfy us because it does not provide for origin marking .
<2en> We will therefore vote against it , because the aim of providing consumers with correct and accurate information about the origin and composition of the product has not been met .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy , young people 's knowledge and skills are essential if the objectives of smart , inclusive and sustainable growth are to be achieved .
<2en> As such , youth has a key role to play in achieving the five EU headline targets for 2020 : employment , research and innovation , climate and energy , education , and the fight against poverty .
<2en> The ' Youth on the Move ' flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy aims to enhance the attractiveness of higher education in Europe , the overall quality of all levels of education and training and student and worker mobility through the more effective use of existing European programmes .
<2en> It is therefore essential to vote for this initiative , so that in the future , we will have young people who are increasingly qualified and prepared to realise the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
<sp>
<2en> The ' Youth on the Move ' initiative emphasises mobility for learning purposes , but it is also vital to ensure that the teaching young people receive meets the needs of the labour market and , as a result , it is vital to give them the skills and knowledge they will need .
<2en> Young people are , unfortunately , one of the social groups worst hit by the global financial crisis and should be given assistance to enter the labour market and to be able to shape their own future and support the economy .
<2en> Education and training are key factors for greater prosperity and greater social cohesion in Europe .
<2en> Student mobility is clearly a central component of the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> It offers many opportunities for students ' intellectual emancipation , for combating early school leaving , unemployment and poverty , as well as for the development of international cooperation in higher education but also in vocational education and training .
<2en> Moreover , student mobility is one of the major challenges of European integration .
<2en> Nonetheless , this mobility should take place with financial resources that measure up to ambitions and with the removal of the practical obstacles to this mobility .
<sp>
<2en> The effects of the global economic crisis were drastic for young people , in particular , right around the world , but also within the EU .
<2en> Youth unemployment within the EU has reached a high of 21 % .
<2en> This is compounded by the fact that 15 % of these young people dropped out of school and thus lack any qualifications for the labour market .
<2en> The EU has a target of reducing this rate to 10 % by 2020 and increasing the proportion of people with a qualification from a university or technical college from 31 % to 40 % .
<2en> In order to be able to achieve these targets , there must be EU-wide recognition of education and training courses and qualifications .
<2en> This is also the only way that greater mobility of our young people can be achieved , something which is also intended to help them become acquainted with new cultures and societies so that they also have the option of making a success of themselves beyond their home country in years to come .
<2en> For that reason , barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified , while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted .
<2en> I abstained in the vote , as I believe that there has been no discussion of how to bring about mutual recognition of qualifications obtained through qualitatively differing methods of education and training .
<2en> This especially applies to the skilled trades , for which there is no uniform standard across Europe against which qualifications can be measured .
<sp>
<2en> For young people in particular , there were grave consequences of the global economic crisis , namely , serious rises in the youth unemployment and school drop-out rates .
<2en> Young people often find themselves with no prospects .
<2en> Against this backdrop , it is important to increase the mobility of young people in the EU so that , where necessary , they will have more chance of finding work on another labour market .
<2en> The basis for this is the mutual recognition of qualifications and courses of education and training .
<2en> I abstained from the vote on this report as it fails to propose any tangible solutions to the issue of how mutual recognition is to take place where , of course , in many fields , there are qualitatively highly differing methods of education and training .
<sp>
<2en> European Union Member States are facing a high rate of youth unemployment .
<2en> In some countries , it is even touching 21 % .
<2en> That is double the average unemployment rate for adults .
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because it provides guidelines on how to improve young people 's education and reduce the youth unemployment rate .
<2en> I agree with the report 's provision that it is very important to focus on the creation of new programmes that would allow young people to combine work with studies .
<2en> This is crucial for students who are seeking an education , but who have to support themselves financially .
<2en> One of the programme 's key objectives is to reduce the number of people leaving school early , which increases the risk of future exclusion from both employment and society .
<2en> We must increase support for people with disabilities and young people with children , so that they can participate in mobility programmes and take advantage of this opportunity to strike a study-work-life balance .
<2en> Access to mobility programmes should be possible not only for university students , but also for young people with a low level of qualifications and school pupils .
<2en> It is also vital for young people to gain more practical knowledge and experience through high quality compulsory traineeships .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> A properly functioning procurement market is of essential importance in order to foster the Single Market , to stimulate innovation , to boost employment , growth and competitiveness , to promote higher levels of environmental and climate protection and protect social rights throughout the EU , and to achieve optimal value for public authorities , citizens and taxpayers .
<2en> With the objective of overcoming the financial and economic crisis , and of protecting against any future crisis , public procurement is of crucial relevance , serving as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the EU economy and , accordingly , for employment and welfare in the EU .
<2en> Therefore , a sound and properly thought-out process of optimising the legal framework for public procurement is of vital importance for the welfare of EU citizens , EU consumers and businesses , and for national , regional and local authorities .
<sp>
<2en> A properly functioning procurement market is of crucial importance to promoting the Single Market , to stimulating innovation , to promoting a high level of environmental and climate protection , and of social inclusion across the EU , and to achieving the highest possible value for public authorities , citizens and taxpayers .
<2en> For these reasons , I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries , and on the revision of the public procurement legal framework , including concessions .
<2en> In this sense , I join the proponents of this resolution in calling on the Commission to prioritise the modernisation of the procurement rules and to address service concessions in order to avoid the further fragmentation of EU law on public procurement , in line with the principles of ' better law making ' .
<sp>
<2en> Public procurement plays a vital role in stimulating the Single Market , promoting innovation , strengthening growth and supporting EU employment and competitiveness .
<2en> However , to achieve this , these must operate effectively .
<2en> For that to happen , as pointed out by the text of this resolution , which I endorse , it is important that the question of simplification and clarification of the rules for awarding public contracts finds answers quickly .
<2en> It also seems essential to me that access to public contracts by SMEs - who account for 99 % of all European businesses and over 100 million jobs - be improved as soon as possible .
<2en> Moreover , in order to support their business , I invite the European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity and to think of new ways of improving access by European companies to public procurement outside the Union , in order to ensure equal conditions for European and foreign companies who are competing for the allocation of public contracts .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We finally abstained due to the fact that several EPP and ECR amendments , inadmissible to us , were adopted .
<sp>
<2en> With a view to overcoming the economic and financial crisis , public procurement appears to be a catalyst for the revitalisation of the European economy , and of enterprise , employment and consumer welfare in Europe .
<2en> Due to a gradual liberalisation of special sectors ( water , electricity and gas ) , in order to protect the enterprises that operate in these areas , we need a qualification system for clients , aimed at ensuring that the competing enterprises are selected efficiently .
<2en> I am in favour of the motion for a resolution , since it is necessary , in a transparent regime , to keep the fragmentation of EU public procurement law in order to achieve the highest possible levels of competitiveness and efficiency , as set out in our targets .

<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Madam President , the issue of spent fuel and radioactive waste management is an important and pressing area , which has received even greater attention since the disaster at Fukushima .
<en> Despite technological innovations and solutions and waste management programmes , the problem represents a greater challenge every day .
<en> The management and final disposal of radioactive waste is an existing problem , and will continue to exist in the future .
<en> In Europe we aim for energy security and environmentally friendly , stable energy production .
<en> However , we also need to pay increasing attention to several issues , for instance the processing , transmutation and final disposal of rapidly expanding quantities of radioactive waste .
<en> Not only do we need to create the technical facilities for this , but also build a strict political , legal and social structure .
<en> It would be worth considering , assessing and planning pan-European cooperation in this field .
<en> All responsible participants should be involved in the building and development of this safe process .
<en> We need to take measures that will also protect future generations .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) Madam President , the management of nuclear waste is quite rightly followed closely by the general public , and it is therefore good that the European Commission has decided to handle the issue through comprehensive legislation which clearly defines the duties and responsibility of all the entities participating in this procedure .
<en> It is good that the submitted directive emphasises better quality supervision and controls , but especially the greater transparency of these processes and public participation .
<en> In my opinion , securing sufficient earmarked funds to cover the inevitable costs for decommissioning nuclear reactors and managing the resulting radioactive waste remains an important open question .
<en> The proposed system for monitoring the level of financial reserves through an independent body can , with the right organisation , create the conditions for a nuclear facility to accumulate during its operating life sufficient funds to finance environmentally-friendly decommissioning , and that should be our objective .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Madam President , I welcome the drafting of this report against the background of the change in global nuclear policy and of the Commission 's proposal for a directive in this area .
<en> I must insist on how important it is to apply fairly the ' polluter pays ' principle , as has also proved to be the case in the wake of the disaster in Japan .
<en> Although its low cost makes nuclear energy attractive , the safety of employees and civilians must come first .
<en> This is why I support cooperation between Member States aimed at the safe storage of nuclear waste .
<en> Transparency in this process also involves the population in determining the storage site and other details .
<en> Regional research programmes in this area have already proved their benefit .
<en> I also think that EU Member States need to share the use as well of facilities for treating and storing waste from nuclear power stations .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) Madam President , I am delighted that we are making progress in the area of spent fuel and radioactive waste management , establishing specific requirements which will ensure that Member States manage the national regulatory and organisational framework , and draw up effective national programmes from the creation to the storage of the waste .
<en> In the whole system , it is vital for the rules to include the principle of transparency , supervision and control .
<en> I also welcome the option of deep geological storage , including the principle of reversibility .
<en> Sufficient funding must be secured for national programmes , however , so that the polluter pays , and that is clearly strengthened in this directive , which I am pleased about , including adequate dissuasive sanctions , which must be ensured in every system .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( DE ) Madam President , the speeches show that the Members of the European Parliament have read , digested and evaluated all the details of the proposals .
<en> I do not think that there is a conflict .
<en> I agree that we should include your suggestions in the procedure .
<en> We believe that one point which Mr Swoboda mentioned , the subject of equal cross-border rights for public participation , is important .
<en> It is often the case that final storage sites and nuclear power stations are situated in areas close to national borders for geological or other reasons , which means that the indivisible , equal participation of citizens , transparency and the appropriate rights are all needed from a European perspective .
<en> Thank you very much for your cooperation .
<en> I hope that we will have your support tomorrow in the vote here in Parliament .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The point about transparency is a relevant one .
<en> It is true that the present duty-free system contributes to the financial resources of airports , ferries and so on .
<en> That is what I have said from the beginning in saying that the present duty-free system contains an element of aid .
<en> If airports , air transport , ferries etc. need to be aided , I am sure you would all agree that different and more transparent economic methods need to be considered , rather than a continuation of this non-transparent method of fiscal expenditure .

<en> Question No 21 by Wayne David ( H-0229 / 96 )
<en> Subject : VAT claims
<en> What are the procedures involved in claiming back VAT on goods and services purchased across the European continent by long-distance lorry drivers ?
<en> As regards the VAT forms , is it true that lorry drivers have to complete forms in different formats and the language of the Member State where the goods and services were purchased to be able to claim back VAT , or is it the case that forms in the native language of the driver can be used ?
<sp>
<en> The Eighth VAT Directive on the refund of VAT to taxable persons established in a Member State other than the Member State making the refund , provides for a standard form for the submission of applications for refunds and an explanatory note which the Member States have make available to those making such applications .
<en> The applicant has the right to use the pre-stamped form in any of the official languages of the European Union , whereas the form itself must be completed in the language of the country making the refund .
<en> Although the Commission is aware of the practical problems that these procedures may create for operators , it is not , unfortunately , possible to remedy them in the context of the current VAT arrangements .
<en> Problems of that nature will , however , come to an end when we move on to the definitive VAT regime , based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin .
<en> In fact , the place of taxation will at the same time determine the place at which the tax is deducted .
<en> The tax will be deducted overall , by being charged to the amount of tax owed , regardless of the place at which the tax to be deducted has been paid .
<en> And so , the whole of the detailed procedure provided for under the Eighth Directive is destined to become obsolete .

<en> I thank the Commissioner for his full and comprehensive reply and I take on board the point that he makes at the end that this is essentially an interim problem and once the new arrangements are in force the problem will disappear .
<en> But , given that there is this interim problem and given that enormous difficulties are being caused at the moment , are there no measures at all that the Commission can introduce so that the procedure is made much more straightforward and efficient , albeit in the interim ?
<sp>
<en> The Commission has indeed considered whether , under the present regime , there is any way of eliminating the inconvenience which I acknowledged is there .
<en> I am afraid we have not been able so far to identify any such possibility .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Robert Hersant on 21 April 1996 .
<en> Mr Hersant was chairman of the Robert Hersant press group .
<en> From 1956 to 1978 he was a member of the French National Assembly .
<en> In the direct elections of 1984 , 1989 and 1994 Mr Hersant was elected to the European Parliament and was a member of the Group of the European People 's Party in this House .
<en> He was a member of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment .
<en> Our sympathy goes to his family , his parliamentary group and all his friends .
<en> I now ask you to rise for one minute to honour his memory .
<en> ( Parliament rose and observed one minute 's silence )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 102 ( 2 ) .
<en> Yesterday , as on many previous occasions , there was no interpretation into or out of Finnish or Swedish in the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , despite the fact that a member of the committee from Finland was presenting a report and had to deal with very detailed amendments .
<en> As an English speaker , I condemn this discourtesy to other Members of Parliament .
<en> It is very discriminatory that they should be forced to present their views in a foreign language .
<en> I urge you , Mr President , to ensure in future that where a Member has to present a report they are able to do so in their own language even if this means taking interpreting staff from another committee for the period concerned .
<en> The committee views this with the greatest concern .
<en> All speakers in this Parliament are entitled to speak in their mother tongue whether that language is spoken by many or by few .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I want to say something about the celebration of an important day tomorrow , i.e. Schuman Day , Europe Day or Peace in Europe Day .
<en> All across Europe this will be celebrated by the flying of the European Flag except in Scotland where the Secretary of State for Scotland , a British Government Minister , has forbidden the flying of the European Flag from British Government buildings and has tried to prevent the distribution of Europe Day materials to schools .
<en> This Parliament should know about this and if you ask why is he doing this , it is because of the beef crisis .
<en> He is trying to make Europe the scapegoat for his own inadequacies in representing the Scottish beef industry .
<en> However , I am glad to tell the House that local authorities right across Scotland will be flying the flag in defiance of that ban .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , following on from Mr Macartney 's comments , I would like to report that Mr Forsyth , while refusing to fly the European flag from public buildings in Scotland , has a party of Scottish Office officials visiting this Parliament to learn more about the European Union and the workings of Parliament .
<en> I suspect he has sent these officials over here to fly the flag .
<sp>
<en> Gentlemen , let us call a halt to this debate .
<en> I can assure you that the European Parliament will not be influenced by the comments of the British Secretary of State for Scotland .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order pursuant to Rule 28 ( 2 ) ; in November 1995 I sent you a question within the meaning of Rule 28 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure on the building policy in Brussels , asking you whether , in particular , the Brussels Bench had been contacted by the presidency with regard to Parliament 's buildings policy .
<2en> You replied to me more than four months later - which is well outside the period of thirty days - not giving me any answer at all on this point but simply combining two questions to which you had already replied previously and not giving me any answer with regard to the specific point I had raised .
<2en> I think this is an infringement of the Rules of Procedure , though probably not intentional .
<2en> To be clear I should like to say that the question I have in mind is No 14975 of 10 November 1995 .
<2en> I would ask you , Mr President , to explain why no reply has ever been given to the questions concerning in particular the buildings policy in Brussels which has aroused , and continues to arouse , many doubts in this House .
<sp>
<en> I shall look into that , Mr Florio .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , our group voted against the Schulz report because for internal policy reasons Mr Schulz has created an extremely contradictory report through his amendments , by which he has tried to belittle the Bavarian security organs , which represent an important front in the fight against organized crime .
<2en> That is why we could not vote for that report and we call on Mr Schulz to follow the example of the US Congress and the US Senate , where both large parties have jointly initiated a major programme to combat nuclear smuggling , which they designated as the number one threat to the United States , on the basis of a report by the Institute for Strategic Studies which drew on hundreds of cases of nuclear crimes in the territory of the former Soviet Union .
<2en> The United States has managed to get the major democratic forces to cooperate .
<2en> Mr Schulz has missed that opportunity and I hope we will soon follow the example of the United States in this area .
<sp>
<en> I should first like to pay a sincere tribute to our colleague and friend Mr Schulz , for the documentary quality of his report and the intense effort that must have gone into it .
<en> We are rightly focusing on this traffic in nuclear materials , a quite recent development .
<en> This form of contraband presents dangers on a completely different scale to those we have encountered in other fields .
<en> Thus , we need to reconsider the nuclear problem in terms of its origin : the production of energy .
<en> We must not totally call into question nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
<en> On the other hand , we need to be even more vigilant in view of the potential dangers it involves .
<en> Next , we need to take due account of the handling of nuclear wastes and to suppress this unhealthy trade that I have denounced .
<en> It is absolutely essential to monitor all flows of fissile materials and other nuclear wastes .
<en> Euratom could very well take charge of this if the Commission and Council were to take a decision to that effect .
<en> The territory of the European Union cannot remain a permanent nuclear danger zone .
<en> With this aim in mind , we must take into account the many questions posed by the countries of central and eastern Europe , which today are juggling dangerously with the civil and military nuclear arsenal which they have acquired .
<en> Our duty is clearly to establish the means for combatting the distribution of these substances .
<en> These are areas in which there is a need for precise knowledge of the situation with this traffic and the risks being run .
<en> We need a strong political will to protect the public .
<en> I have no desire to find myself shortly a victim of those ' sorcerer 's apprentices ' whom I denounced a few months ago .
<sp>
<en> Illegal trade in nuclear material and radioactive elements must of course be fought strongly .
<en> This trade is evil both for human beings and for the environment .
<en> Action must be taken to stop it .
<en> But we are being used to bring about the creation and extension of Europol and as a means of exerting pressure on Member States to ratify the Europol convention .
<en> We have therefore chosen to abstain from the final vote on the Schulz report .
<sp>
<en> My understanding is that it is necessary to get to the root of this problem which is the production of radioactive elements leading to potential for trade in ' waste products ' .
<en> This problem is mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Schulz report , which is good .
<en> Therefore , I intent to vote no to Amendment No 22 , which would remove this .
<en> Illegal trade in nuclear material is a problem not only for EU countries but an international problem .
<en> Therefore , we must take action internationally to resolve the problem .
<en> Of course the UN and Interpol should receive increased resources to be able to take action .
<en> Closer cooperation between all the countries involved is important , not just in the EU but internationally .
<en> Europol is not the appropriate organisation for this issue as Europol is not a global organisation .
<en> I am voting against paragraph 18 which requests that Member States should immediately bring about the creation and extension of Europol .
<sp>
<en> The Danish social democrats in the European Parliament are voting in favour of the Schulz report on the illicit traffic in radioactive substances and nuclear materials .
<en> We are doing so because we agree with the rapporteur that it is absolutely essential to do something to prevent this illicit traffic .
<en> As the situation appears now , the actual problem is very small , but there is potentially a major problem just around the corner .
<en> If we do not treat the problem with the respect it deserves , it may come to be a threat to the environment , public health and both internal and international security .
<en> One of the most important ways of combatting illicit traffic is making the best possible use of the technology available to us .
<en> That is why , in this report , Parliament is calling on the Commission to assess the possibilities offered by modern technology .
<en> It is also vital for us to set up close monitoring and a comprehensive register of the trade in radioactive and nuclear materials , as a means of uncovering any illegal ramifications .
<en> Moreover , it is clear that we should keep a watchful eye on the countries of Eastern Europe , and also investigate whether these countries are complying with the rules on safety monitoring , and how security can be improved and extended .
<en> However , it is important to emphasize that even if the problem is potentially a major one , we should not make the very serious mistake of devising a much too complicated and comprehensive solution which simply adds to the problem instead of solving it : the solution must be appropriate to the problem .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , not specifically on the Minutes but on the Brussels Notebook which we have just found in our pigeonholes .
<en> This is a small but serious point : the notebook from the Session News Unit refers to important debates on economic and monetary union last evening .
<en> Obviously there is a good deal of interest in this Parliament on the British position on this subject .
<en> However , the printers of the relevant British parliamentary records and documents this week announced major redundancies with hundreds being made redundant in Norwich and elsewhere .
<en> That could seriously threaten the future availability of the information to this parliament and our Members .
<en> I would ask you to join me in contacting the newly privatized Stationery Office in Britain to seek clear assurances from them that all Members of this Parliament will be able to obtain the same service that has existed for our Members when it was a public body , namely proper access to all relevant documents of the British Parliament and Government , for example on economic and monetary union .
<sp>
<en> I do not think that the matter you have raised is within this Parliament 's competence .
<en> We will look into the matter and see if there is anything that we can do .

<en> Question No 37 by Gerardo Galeote Quecedo ( H-1027 / 96 )
<en> Subject : Cuba
<en> Could the Commission supply an assessment of the common position on Cuba adopted unanimously by the General Affairs Council , pursuant to Article J.2 of the TEU , at its meeting of 25 November 1996 ?
<sp>
<en> The honourable Member asks in his question for the Commission to supply an assessment of the common position on Cuba .
<en> I should like to make it clear that the Commission fully supports the common position , which is line with and follows on from previous European Union statements , such as the declarations issued by the European Council at the Madrid and Florence summits .
<en> The common position enables us to steer a middle course between vigilance with regard to human rights and support for the process of economic and social improvement .
<en> It should also be emphasized that the common position is a very useful instrument , in that it sets out systematically and in detail the areas of the European Union 's cooperation and the terms of its relations with Cuba .
<en> It thus specifies the various preconditions for the possible stepping-up of cooperation with Cuba .
<en> This clear presentation should benefit the Union , as well as Cuba itself .
<en> In general terms , the common position has the merit of reaffirming the specific nature of the political line taken by the European Union with regard to Cuba , and of pointing out , in particular , that the EU rejects any attempt to bring about change in Cuba by means of retaliatory economic measures or pressure on the people of that country .
<sp>
<2en> Commissioner , thank you for your reply ; I am pleased to note that the Commission shares the Council 's common position which , as you say , is consistent with the trend of events between the Madrid and Florence European Councils .
<2en> It should be recalled that during this period the Commission , in the person of its Vice-President Marín , took note on the spot of the rigidity of the Cuban regime and therefore did not present the draft mandate .
<2en> By the Council 's offer of negotiations now , if a start is made on reforms to guarantee respect for human rights and to begin the transition to democracy , the European Union is opening doors to hope , for which the Cuban people will certainly be grateful .
<2en> I would also like to congratulate you , Commissioner , on the reference you made to the specific nature of the common position on Cuba , since this Parliament , and certainly my Parliamentary Group , have opposed the embargo policy of the United States Government , and the Helms-Burton Act in particular .
<2en> Following this question and your statement , clearly I would like to ask you what specific action the Commission proposes to take to develop the guidelines contained in that common position , and specifically how you propose to ensure that aid is channelled through non-governmental organizations with no link to the regime , as set out in the common position .
<sp>
<2en> Mr Galeote , the common position undoubtedly provides the continuity that we wish to see , and it builds on the declarations issued by the European Council in Madrid and Florence .
<2en> It also unequivocally reaffirms the Union 's rejection of the use of retaliatory economic measures .
<2en> However , this continuity is not entirely linear , in the sense that the common position also makes an urgent call for an improvement in the human rights situation and greater political freedom .
<2en> This criterion also comes into play in determining our line of conduct .
<2en> Naturally , there is a need to ensure that the money we make available actually gets to where it is meant to go .
<2en> The aid is conveyed to its destination entirely by European NGOs , and those NGOs are required to ensure that the goods do actually reach their goal .
<2en> With regard to humanitarian aid , I should like to point out that the terms of reference agreed by the Commission and the Cuban authorities stipulate that the NGOs remain the owners of the goods until they are delivered to the final beneficiaries , and consequently also retain control over them .
<2en> In this way , therefore , we are seeking to ensure that the system functions properly .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I wish to pay tribute to your very fair presidency of Question Time .
<en> I gather this is going to be your last one and I am sorry to see you go .
<en> I hope you will not take that off my one minute , of course !
<en> I accept the Commissioner 's response on the question of the common position on Cuba but I hope that we will not get so hung up on the question of human rights that we forget the essentials of our position towards Cuba , which is to oppose the Helms-Burton Act and the attempt by the US to blackmail the people of Cuba and the people of the world , because of specific ideological commitments in the US .
<en> I wish to say that , having visited Cuba and America on several occasions , human rights in Cuba are often rather better than human rights in the USA , particularly the rights to free health , to free education and to a system which attempts to protect them .
<en> In fact , the infant mortality rate in Cuba is actually rather better than in inner-city Washington .
<en> Those are the human rights which the Cuban people want to keep and , although we , of course , expect and respect democracy , the broader conception of human rights is one which is shared by this Parliament and I know is shared by the Commissioner .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> We cannot support the Council decision that immigration , asylum , drugs policy , fraud , cooperation on civil law and certain forms of police cooperation shall be decided by a qualified majority .
<en> We believe the requirement for unanimity must remain .
<sp>
<en> Common viewpoints arrived at through interstate agreement are a better way of resolving the issues taken up in Article K1 in the long term , than decisions adopted by a qualified majority .
<en> Immigration , asylum and visa policies must be better coordinated .
<en> This ought to happen through unanimous decisions and not by majority decision .
<en> Police and customs matters must naturally be interstate .
<en> To transfer drugs policy to EU level could lead to a worsening of the situation because the Swedish / Scandinavian restrictive drugs policy would be replaced with a more liberal policy of legalisation .
<en> If it became EU policy , the report would lead to a massive transfer of decision making power from the Member States to EU level .
<en> This is why I am voting against the report .
<sp>
<en> Voting time is now closed .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Madam President , that would involve a change in policy .
<en> I am not in a position to announce that today but I will draw your suggestion to the attention of my colleagues who are specifically responsible for these projects .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should just like to refer briefly to the question of human rights and the death penalty in the United States .
<2en> I feel that I must tell you that a few minutes ago I received a telephone call from Joseph O 'Dell , a prisoner under sentence of death , from death row in a Virginia jail .
<2en> Using the few minutes of telephone time allowed to him by the prison authorities , Mr O 'Dell asked me to convey his sincere gratitude to the European Parliament for the interest which the House has taken and is still taking in his right to demonstrate his innocence .
<sp>
<en> The topical and urgent debate is closed .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 5.23 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
<sp>
<en> We now come to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> On the Kokkola report ( A4-0251 / 97 ) on the Commission communication on incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities and on the KestelijnSierens report on the Commission 's annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the EU 1996 ( A40257 / 97 ) .
<en> I and many British Conservative Members of the European Parliament wholeheartedly support the principle of equal opportunities for women and men and agree that mainstreaming is a valuable tool in helping to put that principle into practice .
<en> We welcome the increasing recognition of the problems experienced by women in particular and the increasing efforts being made at all levels to remedy the situation .
<en> We are not convinced , however , that the best way to achieve an equal representation of women in decision-making , for example , is through artificial discrimination of the sort proposed in both the Kokkola and Kestelijn-Sierens reports .
<en> The fixing of temporary quotas , though perhaps attractive in the short-term , is not the answer .
<en> We consider the suggestion in the Kokkola report that Commission working groups and expert committees should be made up of equal numbers of men and women to be particularly impractical and unhelpful .
<en> We firmly believe that appointments to such positions should be made on merit and qualification .
<en> To impose so-called positive discrimination in the way suggested may have the short-term benefit of increasing the figures of female representation in decision-making bodies .
<en> In the long-term , however , it could only be detrimental to the position of women in general .
<en> The proposal in the Kestelijn-Sierens report that the Commission should include a gender-impact assessment in its proposals for legislation is equally impractical .
<en> What is needed is practical concrete measures to give women the opportunities to achieve the qualifications and freedoms which will allow them to compete on a fair and equal footing with men on the jobs market and in the decision-making arena - not airy statements of the likely implications of proposed legislation , which in most cases are impossible to define or quantify with any degree of accuracy .
<en> Improvements are needed in many areas , not least with regard to the difficult task of combining work outside the home with family responsibilities .
<en> However , to suggest , as Mrs Kokkola 's report does , that social services , such as care for children and the elderly , school meals and public transport , should be financed by the structural funds , is nothing short of ludicrous .
<en> I am glad that Parliament as a whole voted against this proposal , although I note that British Labour MEPs voted for it .
<en> We also do not believe that it is the Commission 's role to decide how fiscal measures and social security benefit can be used to help bring work in the family into the official economy .
<en> These are all matters which should be dealt with at national , regional and local level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> The Kokkola and Kestelijn-Sierens reports rightly highlight the difficulties involved in achieving equal opportunities for men and women today and contain some very salient points .
<en> I and my colleagues will vote for these reports because their ultimate aim and motivation is to the benefit of women in Europe .
<en> We nevertheless wish to place on record our regret that they contain some suggestions which are unlikely to help women , and risk bringing the EP 's work for women into disrepute .
<en> Eriksson report ( A4-0201 / 97 )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I speak from local experience of the zero-tolerance campaign run in Thurrock in my constituency .
<en> Colleagues from the South Essex Rape and Incest Crisis Line tell me that posters in shops , public houses and at bus-stops enabled the issue of violence against women to be discussed in the open and validated the private experiences of many women for the very first time .
<en> This local project fully supports the extension of zerotolerance campaigns to other European countries , backed up by rape crisis telephone helplines , also absent in many of our countries .
<en> Another local women 's project in my constituency - the Southend Women 's Refuge - also supports this initiative .
<en> I helped them recently to open their new ' dove ' project - an open drop-in counselling centre for women who are victims of domestic violence .
<en> In just a few weeks five new women a day came forward for counselling .
<en> These two local examples show how far sexual violence is a reality for women today .
<en> They fully justify today 's parliamentary decision to respond with a European-wide campaign .
<sp>
<en> In the multicultural and pluralistic European Union , people clearly find it difficult to show respect for different opinions .
<en> With laughter and scorn , Parliament rejected the opportunity to vote on Mrs Eriksson 's two oral amendments to support active work against pornography and prostitution and to welcome initiatives from Member States concerning the criminalization of the customers of prostitutes .
<en> These are amendments which we would naturally have supported .
<en> That prostitution and pornography are the reason for the misconceptions about women which often lead to rape and beating etc . , is something we are convinced of , and we regret that Parliament did not have the courage to reach a decision on the proposed amendment .
<en> We would also like to stress how important it is that society gives vulnerable women and children help in the form of national legislation , and also in the form of help to take on a new identity , a new area to live in and a new job , and thereby the opportunity to escape their tormentor .
<en> We also call on Member States to give financial support for women 's refuges and for legal aid .
<en> Violence against women is basically a matter of human rights , something which most people claim to defend .
<en> In spite of this , violence against women takes place all over the world and in all social classes .
<en> Making 1999 an EU campaign year against violence against women should focus attention on the problem and help make the issue a topical one in the Member States .
<en> However , this requires sufficient funding to be allocated in the EU 's next budget , and we hope that will happen .
<en> Lenz report ( A4-0258 / 97 )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Lenz on her report calling for an end to discrimination against women in advertising .
<en> It is a call that is ignored , derided and considered old-fashioned by the advertising industry .
<en> The advertising industry believes that as long as a sardonic quote or a look can be incorporated into the advert , it is open season for portraying women 's bodies in any derogatory way , to sell anything from cars to underwear .
<en> In my local paper , the Birmingham Mail , I am told that an advertisement is going to be unveiled in Birmingham this week in the form of an electronic , 20-foot-high billboard showing a woman taking off her clothes continuously .
<en> The AA , the Automobile Association , is warning that it could be a source of distraction and could lead to accidents .
<en> I quote this as an example of the lengths to which the advertising industry in Britain is going at present in order to sell products : women in chains to sell cosmetics , women who are overweight portrayed in the most derogatory terms .
<en> Mrs Lenz 's call for self-regulation is a laudable one but I fear that the industry will ignore it .
<en> The European Union institutions must use their combined forces and recognize this as a growing problem in the 1990s .
<en> They must act to provide a Europe-wide code of conduct for the advertising industry in order for this discrimination to be stopped .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Crawley , I happily allowed you to exceed your time because your previous experience over a number of years as chairman of the Committee on Women 's Rights and your activity in this Parliament give you the right to justify exceeding your speaking time , when the Chair can allow it , and I was very pleased that you were able to complete your remarks .
<sp>
<en> The Danish Social Democrats are voting for the Lenz report on their own initiative .
<en> Because the media operate across borders , it is necessary to take up this issue at EU level .
<en> It would be desirable for the advertising sector to exercise more self-regulation and to recognize that it is discriminatory to show naked or semi-naked women in advertisements .
<en> If the sector itself is incapable of setting and maintaining certain guidelines for good marketing , it could become necessary to regulate this area at EU level .
<sp>
<en> That completes voting time .

<en> The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , we are used to having the Minutes in two parts .
<en> This morning we have them in four .
<en> How will we know when we have got a full set ?
<sp>
<en> We shall leave that to the intelligence of the Members .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in yesterday 's Minutes , halfway down page 19 , it says the following : " Mr Wijsenbeek referred to his remarks at the start of that morning 's sitting ( part 1 , item 1 ) and reported on how he had spent his time until the resumption of the sitting ' .
<2en> This Dutch is not correct , but the fact is I have still not received a reply from the Bureau as to whether it is actually true that the Bureau is now going to record Members of Parliament entering and leaving Parliament on camera .
<2en> Would you also state whether this is in accordance with the legislation in Europe on the protection of personal privacy and tell Members - because as the Bureau you wish to monitor how we spend our time - how many extra members of staff this will take and what that will cost the taxpayer , so that we can weigh one up against the other .
<2en> I believe that we Members are entitled to a reply to this question from the Bureau and we have not given you carte blanche to take measures that mean we can be spied on and be monitored from dawn to dusk .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much Mr Wijsenbeek .
<en> As usual , I have no idea what you are talking about .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I want to confine my remarks to the repairs clause .
<2en> This will soon become reality if we accept the suggestion that the 180 car and motorcycle manufacturers concerned will end up charging more for repairs and , consequently , for insurance .
<2en> This will happen if we do not accept what Parliament has already decided and what the Commission has already proposed .
<2en> This means - and here I reinforce what has just been said - that we are actually proposing to prohibit the reproduction of visible components .
<2en> This would result in a monopoly , in other words the car manufacturing companies would be in a position to dictate prices .
<2en> Of course we do not want this .
<2en> We do not want increased repair charges any more than we want to see jobs lost .
<2en> I would just like to point out that jobs are going to be lost not only on the production line but also , quite understandably , in the trade sector where spare parts are sold , and of course in turn in the free-market factories which would no longer be able to operate to full capacity .
<2en> Jobs are going to be lost there too .
<2en> We should be advocating both sides of the argument , that is to say both original replacement parts and reproduction parts .
<2en> Both sectors should be tolerated in the same way as we accept authorized repairers and free-market workshops .
<2en> After all , this is the beauty of the free market and it should remain so .
<2en> This approach is entirely justified when one realises that car manufacturers actually have to buy-in 70 % of their original parts .
<2en> The problem of reproduction parts is therefore not as blatant as many would suggest .
<2en> The conclusions to be drawn from this are as follows : yes to design protection - but with a repair clause which allows the reproduction of visible components under quite specific conditions , namely that the original manufacturer is notified that copyright royalties apply .
<2en> The Council has taken the side of the motor companies in this , and in tomorrow 's vote we in Parliament should support the consumer and the free market .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , it is regrettable that the debate on the very important report submitted by Mr Medina Ortega concerning the legal protection of designs has basically become restricted to the repair clause .
<2en> In my opinion a decision supporting this repair clause would represent a pyrrhic victory for the motorists ' representatives .
<2en> By this I mean of course a pyrrhic victory not in the economic sense but rather in the legal sense .
<2en> I can well understand the arguments of motorists ' representatives and spare parts manufacturers , but as a lawyer I cannot recognize any objective criterion for abandoning the principles of design protection in respect of car spares of all things .
<2en> In fact , I consider this development highly questionable and possibly even creating a precedent .
<2en> In truth , the matter under consideration has , I believe , more to do with competition than design protection and it should be judged from that viewpoint .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , as the Commissioner responsible for industry I should have plenty to say about today 's debate .
<en> However , with an eye on the clock I would prefer not to do that but rather to abide by Mr Rothley 's request that the Commissioner should be consistent .
<en> In the first reading the Commission supported the amendments proposed by Mr Medina Ortega .
<en> The Council did not accept these proposals .
<en> Incidentally , responding to a question from a certain female Member , may I just say that the Council vote was unanimous and that therefore one should actually call it a Council decision .
<en> But we want to remain consistent .
<en> We therefore support Parliament 's proposed amendments , but with four exceptions : we do not support Amendment No 12 since we are of the opinion that it complicates things unnecessarily in that it relates to a matter which is itself undecided , and this will certainly not aid the course of events , particularly in respect of a quick decision .
<en> Then we have material reasons for rejecting Amendments Nos 1 , 5 and 6 .
<en> If the repair clause is to be introduced in the form preferred by Parliament , these amendments could in our opinion give rise to uncertainty as to the meaning of the individual details of the clause itself .
<en> Nevertheless , this indicates that we support the greater part of the proposals , including the repair clause , as we did at first reading , and we hope that today 's discussion will have some influence on the Council .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Commissioner .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.

<en> Agreed , I am sorry .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to ask for Parliament 's support for a small technical amendment to point 12 .
<en> Point 12 says that we must refer the decision to the Commission and Court of Auditors .
<en> I have made a slight error , because , of course , I would also like to see us referring the decision to the Council and the governments of Phare recipient countries , so we can be sure that the wise words and stringent requirements of the report are much more widely known .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I request referral back to the Committee on External Economic Relations on the basis of Rule 129 .
<2en> The reason is that the title does not cover the subject dealt with .
<2en> The resolution contains many references to the relocation of companies and direct investments within the Union and not in third countries which is what the report intends .
<2en> Secondly , the resolution is based on the industrial age whereas we are now rushing into the 21st Century in which we will chiefly be dealing with the digital age .
<2en> My group therefore hopes that by referring it back to the Committee on External Economic Relations we will get a more balanced proposal in which the above-mentioned aspects are included .
<2en> I hope my colleagues will support this .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , for the benefit of the House , this is what would be called in English ' a wrecking amendment ' .
<en> It is simply to send something back and we have been given no notice of this .
<en> At no stage in committee and certainly not in the final vote , was any indication given by the Liberals that they fundamentally disagreed with this report , as they are now doing .
<en> No other member of that committee indicated such a line .
<en> This should be regarded as being a frivolous attempt to wreck this report and it would serve no purpose to refer it back .
<en> I ask this House to reject the motion .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the Green Group supports this compromise .
<2en> We have also signed it and would like that to be recorded please .
<sp>
<en> I note that the Green Group in the European Parliament supports the same amendment .
<en> I presume the rapporteur is in favour , since he has signed it , but I should like to know exactly what his position is .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , yesterday , right at the end , we managed to achieve a compromise on the important paragraph 3 with the representatives of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People 's Party , Mr Swoboda and Mr Poettering .
<2en> In this paragraph we tried to combine elements which we are both attached to in a logical and coherent way .
<2en> It therefore contains no ambiguities .
<2en> That is the freedom of a compromise , I believe .
<2en> So these two groups now support it , but I also know that the Greens do , and I have heard from two other groups that they want to vote for this compromise .
<2en> I will read it out to you in the English version .
<2en> It starts with an important element from the socialist amendment :
<2en> Asks the European Council to set in motion the enlargement process by a common act with all applicant countries .
<2en> And here comes the other part :
<2en> Believes that all the applicant countries which do at present meet the criteria of a stable democratic order , respect for human rights and the protection of minorities laid down at Copenhagen have the right to open the strengthened accession and negotiating process at the same time and that this process should begin for all these countries early in 1998 .
<2en> This , Mr President , is the compromise which was reached and I commend it to Parliament .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Mr Oostlander .
<en> Am I to understand that the House gives its assent for this amendment to be put to the vote ?
<en> It appears so , but Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is asking for the floor .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I ask that the two parts of this amendment be put to the vote separately .
<2en> On Amendment No 114
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is questions to the Commission ( B4-0017 / 98 ) .
<sp>
<en> The Commission would remind the author of the question that , according to the provisions of the new Article 255 introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam , the citizen has the right of access to the documents of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission , subject to the principles and limits the Council has to determine , according to the codecision procedure , within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty .
<en> On the basis of these general principles which are common to the three institutions , each one should draw up its own regulations on the specific provisions regarding application .
<en> The Commission will therefore submit a draft legislation , according to the entry into force of the Treaty .
<en> So far , no decision has been taken on the exceptions to the right of access the Commission should propose .
<en> Without any doubt , the Commission considers it essential to develop the policy of transparency and access to its documents , but the future legislation on this matter depends on the result of the interinstitutional negotiations .
<en> Naturally , the declaration included in the final document will be observed , which allows each Member State to ask the Commission or the Council not to disclose a document originating from the country itself without prior permission .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I have three short questions .
<2en> I would like clarification of whether this document will concern all or just three - the most important three - bodies mentioned in the Amsterdam Treaty : the Commission , Parliament and the Council .
<2en> Personally , I think it should be a matter for all to consider .
<2en> Next , I would like to ask about very sensitive issues .
<2en> Is it understood that Europe 's future central bank should be subordinate to public legislation ?
<2en> In addition , Europol cooperation has proved to be an area where there is a need for more openness .
<2en> Finally , I would like to ask whether the Commission could not put together some sort of Green Paper on the subject of openness so that all bodies , including Parliament , could discuss in broad terms what should be done concerning this document ?
<2en> I think this would be an excellent way to proceed .
<sp>
<2en> As a general outline to this additional answer , I have to say , Mr Hautala , that the general secretaries of the three Institutions concerned have already held specific meetings to discuss this point and have formed an interinstitutional working party , under the direction of the Commission , which has been given the task of conducting a preliminary study of the problem .
<2en> The working parties have already been set up and the group is currently reflecting on the questions to be dealt with in the proposal for the future legislation .
<2en> I wish to ask you , Mr Hautala , whether it will be applied to the three institutions ?
<2en> As I recalled , according to the provisions of Article 255 , it is a question of access to the documents of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission and there will be general principles common to the three institutions , on the basis of which each of the three institutions will then draw up its own regulations for specific application .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner whether his studies also cover the internal workings of Parliament , because we have a body , the Conference of Presidents of the various groups , which keeps the Parliamentarians in the dark , and takes all sorts of decisions in secret meetings that we hear nothing about .
<2en> Could this be sorted out ?
<2en> The second thing I wanted to ask is this : what is your attitude to the idea of forcing the European Central Bank to make a public declaration of this kind , which would have the effect of opening the doors to American speculators ? .
<2en> It would not take long to wreck our currency then !
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the voting on any objections concerning the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
<en> After the vote on point II : Human rights
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I am only commenting as a matter of interest , given that the vote has taken place , but I was surprised that the code of conduct for arms exports was included within the issue of human rights .
<2en> It is not a question of human rights .
<2en> It could have been a supplementary point within the framework of a topical debate , but certainly not a point connected with human rights .
<2en> In the future , I would therefore like us to make sure that only questions truly relating to human rights violations are included in the category of " human rights ' .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much , Mr Pasty .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Please be assured , I will put your amendment to the vote , as well as that of the Green Group , but with the rapporteur 's oral amendment applying each time to the text , since it does not concern the text of the amendment , strictly speaking .
<en> ( Parliament adopted the resolution )
<sp>
<en> In Denmark , we have a long and excellent tradition of voluntary work among all age groups , not just among young people , even though the level of activity is substantially higher in that section of the population .
<en> Denmark is often described as ' the nation of organizations ' , and on average , every Dane is a member of some organization or other , whether it is a political party , a youth organization , a Scout movement or a residents ' association .
<en> All these people are working to improve the situation of the members of the organization in question and others who are sympathetic to their cause .
<en> But only a minority would be prepared to work towards developing the European dimension .
<en> We question whether there is such a thing as a ' European dimension ' .
<en> We distance ourselves from this type of EU propaganda among young people and the rest of the population , for that matter .
<en> Nor do we believe there is any need for a common rule applicable to young volunteers .
<en> On the basis of the considerations outlined above , we are voting against a European voluntary service for young people .
<sp>
<en> I fully support the report by our colleague and first Vice-President , Nicole Fontaine .
<en> European voluntary service for young people is an initiative of the European Commission , and more particularly of Mrs E. Cresson , which the European Parliament enthusiastically supported with regard to its baptismal funding .
<en> Unanimity is required with regard to its objectives :
<en> encouraging solidarity through the promotion of a voluntary service for young people aged 18 to 25 , -encouraging the participation of young people in the construction of Europe through youth exchanges and , finally , -encouraging a spirit of enterprise and creativity amongst young people.This being so , as a member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , it is my duty to highlight the deplorable attitude of the Council of Ministers who , once more , are completely out of line with their discourse .
<en> Indeed , it is not sufficient to come to an agreement on the principles ; the practical means for its realization also have to be provided .
<en> On this level it is clear that the sum of ECU 47.5 million granted for the 1998-1999 period in no way does justice to our ambitions and even less still to those of the young people who are waiting impatiently for the time when they will be able to throw themselves into the adventure of solidarity .
<en> I will therefore vote for this report , but with this reservation .
<sp>
<en> Whilst everyone is now in agreement in recognizing that the training and education of young people in the world today are the fundamental axes of development in our societies , here we are confronted by a joint text which goes right to the heart of these issues , and yet which is extremely disappointing .
<en> It is disappointing because the results of all this are minor advances forced out of conciliation .
<en> For the least that can be said is that , in spite of the efforts of our Parliament , the Council was by no means the most conciliatory during the procedure , particularly with regard to the question of the programme 's financial framework .
<en> Indeed , what are these measly ECU 47.5 million in relation to the enthusiastic generosity of tens of thousands of young Europeans awaiting such exchanges , which we have constantly told them are synonymous with good citizenship , openness to social and cultural diversity and mutual enrichment and which are essential qualifications for their full development ?
<en> How can we make them understand , when they are hoping to invest emotionally in transnational activities of collective use , that they will come up against a multitude of legal and administrative obstacles ?
<en> What can we say about the degree of European integration if we are not even capable , at the dawn of the 21st century , to promote this type of initiative intelligently ?
<en> We already know that the programme has enormous potential and can be a brilliant success .
<en> This was the case with the exchange programmes for students .
<en> The many young workers or young unemployed who are no longer studying , and for whom European voluntary service is specifically targeted , want and deserve much more if they are to be supported in their projects for mobility and apprenticeship throughout Europe .
<en> We must , of course , support this much awaited text , even if it is insufficient , because I think this little something , imperfect as it is , is better than nothing at all .
<sp>
<en> I still take the view which I have previously declared on this matter when it was discussed in Parliament .
<en> The report 's firm intention was that the financial framework for the programme 's implementation during the 1998-1999 period should be increased from the Council 's proposal of ECU 35 million to ECU 80 million .
<en> After negotiations with the Council , the Council has now proposed an increase of the sum to total ECU 47.5 million .
<en> I cannot possibly vote for this proposal when I can see how at the same time the Member States are making cutbacks which are causing job losses in the public sector in their respective countries .

<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should like to ask you something .
<2en> The person in seat number 85 has taken a number of photographs of this side of the Chamber today .
<2en> Mr Seppänen regularly takes photos of this side of the Chamber .
<2en> I know that Hans-Gert Poettering is very attractive , but I would really prefer people not to take photos in the Chamber .
<2en> I wonder what they are for ?
<sp>
<en> Taking photographs in the Chamber is not allowed without permission .
<en> I would ask you to stop doing so .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I would simply like to know what is going to be done with this film .
<sp>
<en> I hope you have been reassured and that we can continue with the vote .
<sp>
<2en> No , Madam President , since we have rules in this House I would ask you to ask the gentleman in question , or perhaps he can explain himself , what he is doing with his camera .
<2en> Perhaps there is no film in it , in which case I would be perfectly happy .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr Nassauer , I hope you have informed the security services of this incident .
<en> I should reassure you that to date , Parliament 's security services have almost always resolved such incidents successfully .
<en> I trust this will not prove to be an exception and that the culprits will be identified .
<en> Should it appear necessary to tighten up on security , the appropriate measures will of course be introduced .
<en> Thank you for informing us of the incident .
<en> It will be noted in the Minutes and the security services informed so that they can take appropriate action immediately .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would like to ask the Commission when they propose to deal with the report which was commissioned by DG XIV - reference PEM / 306 - concerning the physical interaction between grey seals , fishing gear and the abnormal predatory conditions of the seals in the North Atlantic , the North-West Atlantic and now penetrating into the South Atlantic .
<2en> It is about time that the Commission had the courage to present that report and its scientific findings to Parliament so that we can deal with that particular matter .
<2en> Predatory behaviour of seals around the Irish and Scottish coasts amounts to the total allowable catch plus one quarter .
<2en> Something has to be done soon and we have to face up to it .
<2en> I ask the Commission to act with haste .
<sp>
<en> Mr Killilea , you know perfectly well that that is not the way to put a question to the Commission .
<en> There are several ways of putting your question .
<en> This is not the right time to ask it .
<en> You can ask it in one of the different ways provided for in the Rules .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I would also like to make a point concerning working conditions because for the second time my trunk has not arrived .
<2en> Each time I put all the files I need here in the trunk and when I arrive , I find out that it is still in Brussels .
<2en> This is very inconvenient because all my documents for work are in that trunk .
<2en> What is happening is that my office is on a corner and it must clearly get in the way , because people put it away in the photocopying room .
<2en> When the removal men come , they obviously forget the trunk .
<2en> I therefore took it out of there and put a label on it to let people know that when my trunk is put away in the photocopying room , it is not taken to Strasbourg .
<2en> I presume that the removal men saw the second part of that note saying that it is not taken to Strasbourg .
<2en> And I still do not have my trunk !
<sp>
<en> We shall take that up with the department which is responsbile , Mrs Guinebertière .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> I explained the significance of the vote quite clearly , Mr Fabre-Aubrespy .
<en> What is involved is a question of principle , namely whether or not a transitional regime is to be established .
<en> One phrase in the text which made provision for this arrangement was deleted .
<en> However , Amendment No 26 has been adopted by the House , which thus establishes the transitional regime .
<en> We now have to take the following decision : whether or not this transitional regime is to be the arrangement in Annex 1 , in other words what Mr Nassauer was asking for .
<en> I can put that to the vote .
<en> Before , I could not go against the text of the Statute , but now the text of the Statute says that there is to be a transitional regime .
<en> We now have to decide whether this transitional regime will be adopted later by Parliament , or if it will be the one contained in point A of Annex 1 to Mr Rothley 's text .
<en> I hope that everyone has now understood the significance of the vote I am about to take on this point A , which will now read : ' For the duration of the parliamentary term following the adoption of the Statute , the following Articles 1-5 shall apply by way of a transitional arrangement ' .
<en> That is the text which I am going to put to the vote .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , after the last vote , I would now ask that you put immediately to the vote the other amendments tabled by the other groups to the effect that we should not have a transitional period .
<en> We have overruled and mixed up what we have voted for in the draft Statute by the previous vote .
<en> You have allowed us now to move something from the annex into the draft Statute .
<en> This is totally contrary to what we are supposed to be doing .
<en> I spoke yesterday about the need for respect and dignity and about all of us agreeing on the principles of what is contained in this draft Statute .
<en> We are shooting ourselves in the foot by what we are doing now .
<en> I would ask you to cancel that last vote because it was illegal .
<sp>
<en> Mr Crowley , can you indicate which amendments you are talking about .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this House has voted on the matter of the transitional period .
<en> It voted that it did not want transitional provisions .
<en> That was as part of the draft Statute .
<en> You have taken amendments to the annex which is to be attached to the draft Statute and voted those before anything else .
<en> I want to know whether a proposal in the annex overrules the earlier vote on the draft Statute , namely not to have a transitional period .
<en> There is a clear conflict between the two texts .
<en> They cannot both be right .
<sp>
<en> May I draw your attention to one point .
<en> When we vote against part of an article we have not approved any other phrase saying we will not have a transitional period .
<en> We vote against part of the text .
<en> Then I put to the vote another amendment to the text of the Statute , not the annex .
<en> That is what we have voted : that we will have the transitional period .
<en> What we still have to decide is whether this is the one established in Annex 1 ( a ) 1-5 , as a transitional regime or not .
<en> This is the only way to know exactly what the House wants .
<en> My task is to allow the House to vote for what it wants and not use words to make Members say what they do not want to say .
<en> That is my duty and I will keep to it .
<en> This discussion is finished .
<en> Before the vote on point A of the annex
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The Commission bears the overall political responsibility for budget execution and for the fight against fraud .
<en> It may delegate management of individual budget lines to a Member of the Commission or to a Director-General .
<en> In any specific case of fraud , it is the individual who committed the crime who will be held legally responsible .
<en> However , the Commission or Commissioner or the Director-General concerned are still responsible for appropriate control and management measures being put in place .
<sp>
<en> I thank the Commissioner for that reply with words like ' responsibility ' and ' individual responsibility for certain areas ' .
<en> My supplementary question is very precise .
<en> If the report from the experts finds very specific problems within the Commission , will that mean that individual Commissioners will at that time take responsibility for the areas under them and , if appropriate politically , resign individually ?
<en> I need only a short answer , just one word will do in any of the official languages .
<sp>
<en> I have already given the answer and I am not going to say what will happen after the Committee of Wise Men give their report .
<sp>
<2en> Commissioner , in the Committee on Budgetary Control Mrs Cresson recently denied any knowledge of certain scandals .
<2en> Meanwhile we have learned that she was informed of them by her administration and we now want to know : who is it who has to resign here ?
<2en> The official who informed her or the Commissioner who falsely said in committee that she had no knowledge of these facts ?
<sp>
<2en> I would like to ask Mrs Gradin whether she would reinstate Paul van Buitenen , who was suspended because he took the trouble to give an elected representative a document which he believed the elected representatives ought to read as part of the investigation into fraud at the Commission ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
<en> Are there any comments ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , my attendance is not recorded even though , as you know , I was here because I sat in the Bureau with you for two hours .
<sp>
<en> That will be corrected , Mr Balfe .
<en> The Minutes were approved
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I want to draw to your attention the fact that the agriculture debates will be starting in a few minutes .
<en> The amendments to two of the reports are still not available in English .
<en> I asked for the amendments yesterday evening .
<en> One set had appeared by this morning - to the Fantuzzi report - but there are still no copies in English of the amendments to the Jové Peres and Happart reports .
<en> It really is not good enough to expect us to debate when we do not have the amendments in our own language .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Hardstaff , I have been informed by my services that there was a technical problem .
<en> The translations will be circulated as soon as possible .
