<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my good friend the rapporteur , Bogusław Liberadzki , on this really balanced and successful report .
<en> As Mrs Sommer has already pointed out , 110 billion tonnes / km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year .
<en> Like Mr Henin , I too would prefer at least part of that quantity to be stored in warehouses .
<en> Unfortunately that is not the case , which is why we must look into that matter too .
<en> A first , important point in this report is the updating and coordination of existing rules on safety requirements for tanks and vehicles .
<en> A second important point is the extension of that requirement from road and rail to inland waterways .
<en> If we look at the transport trend in recent years , it becomes very clear that inland waterways are becoming increasingly important .
<en> I agree with Mrs Lichtenberger that accidents on rivers are , of course , particularly dangerous .
<en> These measures - and here I am speaking as someone who lives in a country of transit - may also lead to a shift towards the railways .
<en> That is , of course , a very good thing .
<en> We in Austria naturally welcome this report , in particular because Austria , given its geographical location , sets very high safety requirements for transport participants .
<en> I also find it extremely welcome that in future every Member State is also to have the right to regulate or prohibit the internal transport of dangerous goods on its territory .
<en> In my view , that includes in particular laying down special provisions on environmental protection and the option of prohibiting or restricting the transport of certain hazardous goods .
<en> If the report is adopted in the wording proposed by the rapporteur , it will be a very good report and we can all be satisfied with the outcome .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to thank our rapporteur for the work he has headed on the really very technical issues involved in the transport of dangerous goods , which represent nearly 10 % of the goods across Europe .
<en> I certainly welcome the fact that not only does the report shed light on rules that affect public safety , it is also extended to inland waterways goods transport , because many of us think that is a mode of transport that should be developed throughout Europe as an alternative to road transport .
<en> It also raises high hopes on the part of European citizens .
<en> As well as being a step towards simplification of the legislation as regards the administrative procedures , for both consignors and consignees , it is also a crucial step for the training of personnel involved with the safety of dangerous goods .
<en> Although we have to define our position on certain points raised in the amendments in more detail , the report undoubtedly represents a step forward , on clarity in particular and on safety .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I wholeheartedly echo the comments of my Group colleague , Mrs Lichtenberger .
<en> We welcome this package as a step in the right direction , albeit with some reservations .
<en> Our amendments seek to strengthen the package , particularly in relation to training in how to deal with accidents and the right of individuals to know what is being transported .
<en> I personally would like to go further still .
<en> I would like to include military and civil nuclear materials in the same framework .
<en> Scotland , sadly , plays host to military nuclear facilities and civil nuclear sites and sees regular transports .
<en> The Sunday Herald newspaper recently revealed that 67 nuclear safety incidents relating to transport have taken place in Scotland over the last seven years .
<en> So there is clear room for improvement , and I believe that the EU can act where the UK Government will fail to .
<en> In the meantime , however , I welcome any steps in the direction of giving people greater rights to know what they are sharing the roads and waterways of Europe with , and that they are safe .
<en> This report helps to do that , so we welcome it .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , dear MEPs , between 1995-2004 freight transport increased by 28 % , and by 2020 a 50 % increase is predicted .
<en> 58 % of the freight transported is carried by road , 25 % by rail and 17 % by internal navigable waterways .
<en> Dangerous goods represent 8 % of the transported freight .
<en> This transport type highly endangers the regions the goods are carried through and therefore , the European Union must take the necessary measures to increase the security of this transport type .
<en> The existing laws in the European Union cover only the transport of dangerous goods by road and by rail , but for transport by sea there are only international conventions to which Member States are party .
<en> Following Romania and Bulgaria 's accession to the EU , almost the entire length of the Danube has become an internal navigable waterway .
<en> The Danube runs through seven European capitals and nearby many urban agglomerations , that is why the safety of the transport of dangerous goods along Danube is extremely important .
<en> It is essential that the measures on the transport of dangerous goods should be doubled with measures on the intervention of emergency services in cases of accidents where such transports are involved .
<en> There is a huge number of victims , even among those who should intervene in the event of an accident .
<en> Moreover , the transport of dangerous goods should be carried out during less crowded periods and routes , so that the related risks can be minimized .
<en> I think that for the safety of the transport of dangerous goods a short a transition period as possible is needed in order to implement this Directive .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank Mr Liberadzki and the Committee on Transport and Tourism again for this excellent report , which , like you , I really hope will enable us to adopt the proposal right away at first reading .
<en> In fact , it is because we are anxious for it to be adopted at first reading that we are ready to agree to the amendments reflecting the negotiated agreement between the institutions .
<en> We do not , however , think the amendments that would jeopardise agreement at first reading are desirable .
<en> What is true is that , as everyone has emphasised , the report will help to simplify the legislation and therefore make it easier to apply and thus to extend to inland waterways .
<en> I agree with Parliament that the inland waterways networks should be widely developed .
<en> They can be a way for Europe to achieve the modal shift that we would like to see .
<en> That is what I wanted to make clear .
<en> Once again , I thank Parliament and its rapporteur for its excellent work on this report , backed by expert knowledge .
<en> I think it can be said that the consultation on this report was absolutely exemplary .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing - ( FR ) The steady rise in the transport of dangerous goods has made it necessary to introduce European legislation to simplify and coordinate the rules applicable to the transport of these goods .
<en> It is our responsibility to protect public safety and that also applies to the transport of dangerous goods .
<en> It therefore seems important to me that Member States should be able , if necessary and in a proportionate and transparent fashion , to require the use of mandatory routes .
<en> They must also be able to insist that carriers use one mode of transport rather than another if they believe that that will be safer for their citizens .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I should also like to thank all the Members for a very interesting debate .
<en> I would like to tell you a story from Greek mythology .
<en> You can find this story depicted in mosaics in Pathos in Cyprus .
<en> It is the story of the first wine drinkers .
<en> A servant of the god Dionysus stole wine to give it to humans for the first time .
<en> They drank it , got drunk for the first time in human history , thought they were poisoned and killed the servant who had given them the wine .
<en> In this day and age the solutions are much more complicated , and we must come up with a different approach .
<en> Everyone has chosen a different approach .
<en> Some say that we have gone too far , others that we have not gone far enough .
<en> Some would have wanted us to legislate on everything , others that everything should be done by the Member States .
<en> The fact is that the solution lies somewhere in the middle .
<en> We are to complement Member States and support them in their policies , but that does not mean that there is no role for the European Union , as was reflected in the report and what Members have said .
<en> At the same time , not everything can be solved through legislation .
<en> We must , therefore , give the forum a chance to work and produce concrete results , which we will monitor .
<en> However , at the same time , as has already been said , legislation exists in the Member States on many of these aspects .
<en> It is implementation that is lacking and causing the problem .
<en> Therefore , putting pressure on the Member States will help us to achieve positive results .
<en> No matter what each side expected , we should not underestimate the importance of the fact that , for the first time , we have acknowledged at European level that there is a problem regarding alcohol-related harm , that there should be a European strategy - which has been adopted today - and that we now have a European debate , a European initiative and European action .
<en> This is important .
<en> No Member State can solve this problem in isolation and no Member State is immune from this problem .
<en> There is now binge-drinking in Spain , which used to be a north-western European problem .
<en> Therefore , one sees that , given cultural interchanges and other reasons - a social analyst could explain why this is happening - we have the same problems moving across borders , and there are no geographical barriers to such problems .
<en> They exist everywhere in the European Union .
<en> This is the first important step , though not the last one .
<en> If we do not see a result within a reasonable time then we can re-evaluate , reassess and re-examine this strategy and take a different approach or a different course .
<en> However , we are on the right track for now .
<en> Once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur , the committee and the Members for supporting this strategy .
<en> I look forward to working with you to achieve the results that we all desire .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) The excessive consumption of alcohol is a blight in European societies .
<en> We are losing innumerable lives to illnesses caused by alcohol consumption , and the number of victims of drink-driving is also extraordinarily high in the Member States .
<en> Alcohol consumption and habits vary from country to country and indeed from region to region and so it is proper that defensive strategies are created in the Member States .
<en> There is still a need for individual EU directives .
<en> Minors have to be protected in every possible way from alcohol , and to achieve this even more stringent sanctions are needed .
<en> In the spirit of ' don 't drink and drive ' , zero tolerance and a 0.00 % blood alcohol level must be introduced for drivers throughout the entire EU .
<en> But we will not make progress with prohibitions alone , as is so well demonstrated by the ignominious failure of the American Prohibition .
<en> We must popularise good habits in alcohol consumption and the consumption of low-alcohol beer and wine .
<en> We must act robustly against the trade in types of alcohol that are adulterated , fake , of poor quality and harmful to health .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - It is a worrying trend that in recent years alcohol manufacturers are targeting under-age drinkers with products such as ' alcopops ' .
<en> Binge drinking is increasing amongst young people and it is important that we tackle this development effectively .
<en> I believe that a good way to do this is to encourage supermarkets and shops to better separate alcopops from soft drinks .
<en> Alcopops , along with other alcohol drinks , should also carry adequate health warnings .
<en> I am pleased that my amendments along these lines were incorporated into the report .
<en> Of course , to tackle under-age and binge drinking effectively , national governments must also focus on the consumer through changing attitudes towards alcohol .
<en> I therefore welcome the focus on information and awareness-raising campaigns such as through school-based educational programmes .
<en> I also support the recommendations that the limit for blood alcohol content ( BAC ) should be set as close to 0.00 % as possible , especially for new drivers .
<en> I believe that the widespread availability of breath analysers , suggested in the report , can help to deter potential drink drivers .
<en> National governments can do more to ensure the availability of public transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol .

<en> ( DE ) Madam Commissioner , genetic engineering in farmed foods makes many people in Europe uneasy , anxious and afraid .
<en> Is this subject again playing , or will it continue to play , a greater role in the Doha Round ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - It is obvious that what we have experienced throughout the last few months in terms of the price increases in Europe , especially as reported in the newspapers in Germany throughout the summer break , has of course raised many questions .
<en> These are quite new questions on agricultural policy in Europe , where we were previously fighting against overproduction , intervention stocks , and we are now in a much more balanced market , thanks , I think , to the decoupling of the direct payment to farmers , which allows farmers to react to the market instead of calculating the best outcome on the cheque from Brussels .
<en> It is clear that in the Doha Round the préférence communautaire or the security of food supply is not in itself an issue .
<en> It is , of course , crucial to everybody round the world to be sure that they can feed their own people , but it is not exclusively a chapter in our negotiations .
<sp>
<en> In addition to expressing unease about yet further concessions damaging to our agricultural interests , can I ask you what focus there has been in the negotiations on raising beef production standards amongst those who seek greater access to our market , so that we might end the prejudicial impact on our own producers of permitting food imports where traceability and quality fall far below the standards that we expect of our own producers ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - I think I have heard this before .
<en> I might be wrong , but it reminds me of some question raised by the Irish Minister and some Irish MEPs on the import from Brazil , traceability , and the opinion of the Irish farmers on lack of traceability .
<en> It is obvious that we are following this case closely , and I know that my colleague , Commissioner Kyprianou , will be meeting the committee in Parliament .
<en> We want to ensure fair trade , which means that importers or exporters into the European Union have to meet the same quality standards as our own producers .
<en> I will be visiting Brazil next month to see if they can show me what I want to see : that is , how things work in Brazil concerning the possibility of tracing back the products that are taken into the European Union .
<sp>
<en> Question No 36 is inadmissible as its author is no longer a Member .
<en> Subject : Amendment of the CMO in wine
<en> On 4 July 2007 the Commission unveiled a proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine .
<en> Funds for the ' national envelopes ' are allocated according to a key which is based to 50 % on the historical input of Member States , 25 % on area and 25 % on production .
<en> Moreover , adjustments have been made in favour of certain Member States .
<en> Will the Commission say which criteria were used in the selection of the specific allocation key and why the funds are not allocated on the basis of the historical payments of Member States over a representative reference period , as occurred in the case of all those CMOs which have so far been amended ?
<en> Furthermore , given that the overall amount of resources is limited , how was it decided to adjust input for the benefit of some Member States , which necessarily results in a corresponding decrease for the others ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) I too would like to point out the importance of this issue , so I am pleased that the Council has addressed the Commission and is awaiting an answer .
<en> Nevertheless , I would like to ask : what are the Commission 's views on the force as regards extraordinary situations , and , bearing in mind all these floods and fires , climate change and the events taking place far from here , in America , what are the Commission 's views on the actual role of such a force in extraordinary situations ?
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President-in-Office , you have mentioned the Barnier report several times .
<en> This report has prompted fears among the aid organisations because it seems to provide for quasi-military leadership structures or preliminary decision-making at military level .
<en> Is the Council aware of these fears about the ' militarisation ' of this civil protection force , and how can , and will the Council , respond to these concerns ?
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , as I have already mentioned , the Council 's proposal and conclusions on Mr Barnier 's report were that this could form a working basis for future decisions .
<en> This was not a 100 % endorsement nor even a partial endorsement that this should form a working basis .
<en> It was simply what the Council agreed at the time .
<en> As I have just said , I cannot pre-empt the Council 's reaction to proposals , models and methods that do not yet exist , as that would be to pre-empt history .
<en> We must await the Commission 's proposals and assessment .
<en> We will then discuss these in the Council and come to conclusions .
<en> We will also decide on the direction to be taken in that respect , which brings me to an important point .
<en> The Council , by asking the Commission to submit proposals on this issue , has unequivocally indicated its interest in the subject and its desire to move forward in this respect .
<en> In my opinion , that is an undeniable and positive sign .
<sp>
<en> Subject : Fate of Professor Ukshin Hoti
<en> The internationally recognised scientist and peace activist Professor Ukshin Hoti , Foreign Minister of the democratic underground Republic of Kosovo led by President Rugova in the nineties , was arrested by the Milosevic regime and disappeared without a trace many years ago .
<en> Can the Council ascertain from the government in the now democratic Serbia what happened to Professor Hoti and determine if the Belgrade authorities are prepared to conduct an investigation into this matter ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr Posselt , Professor Ukshin Hoti is one of more than 2 000 people included on the list of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) whose families reported their disappearance during the Kosovo conflict .
<en> The ICRC has , since January 1998 , been gathering information on people who disappeared in Kosovo .
<en> This information has been sent to the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina , together with a request for them to do their utmost to discover the whereabouts of these people .
<en> The ICRC in Kosovo is also working on this issue in strict cooperation with the United Nations Missions in Kosovo .
<en> As part of the dialogue on issues of mutual interest between Pristina and Belgrade , the working group on missing persons which has representatives in both governments has met periodically since March 2004 under the auspices of the Red Cross .
<en> Work is being carried out on both sides in order to discover the whereabouts of missing persons , but progress is slow .
<en> The right to know the whereabouts of missing loved ones is a fundamental issue of humanitarian law and human rights .
<en> As a result , the Council of the European Union is supporting the work being carried out by the international and local authorities in Serbia and Kosovo to this end and is encouraging them to increase their efforts .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for the joint motions for a resolution arising out of the EU-Russia Summit , where Parliament , among other things , called on the Russian Government to create , together with the European Union , the necessary conditions for a rapid start to the negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia .
<en> Other issues covered included Russia 's pending accession to the WTO , human rights issues in Russia , the climate for investment and ongoing concerns over the upholding of the Conventional Forces Europe Treaty .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The 18th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall came after the EU-Russia summit , which was held after this report was discussed but before it was put to the vote .
<en> Eighteen years later , what used to be Eastern Europe is now a democratic area in which the market economy is an established feature .
<en> Russia , meanwhile , is far from democratic and far from being a reliable partner .
<en> In relation to energy , Kosovo , the Caucasus , Central Asia , Ukraine , Moldova or on the Iranian nuclear issue , Russia 's contribution to the solution has been found wanting .
<en> In the same week the European Council on Foreign Relations presented a report stating that the Russians are making the rules in relations between Russia and the European Union , and that Europe has shown a lack of unity and of strategy , in some cases not appearing to have put memories of the Soviet era behind them , while in others being overly pragmatic .
<en> It then rightly suggests that EU strategy should encourage Russia to respect the rule of law .
<en> Even though it is not a liberal democracy , Russia must be a predictable and reliable state , and Europe must work hard to that end .
<sp>
<2en> We consider the freedom to disclose information to be an important principle .
<2en> Civil servants should , without risk of reprisal , be able to provide information , obtain information in order to exercise their freedom of expression and freedom to disclose information , have the right to anonymity and an investigation ban which means that authorities and other public bodies are not allowed to investigate who has provided information under the freedom to disclose information .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I strongly disagree with the Atkins amendment ( Amendment 1 to paragraph 15 ) to the Committee on Petitions ' report by Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo .
<en> The Ombudsman 's Special Report regarding OLAF concerns the allegations made by the Office against a journalist who covered the story regarding its investigation into allegations made by Mr van Buitenen .
<en> Regardless of whether Mr van Buitenen 's allegations are right or wrong , we should defend the right of journalists to report on matters of public interest , even those who work for newspapers which are not very supportive of our views .
<en> The Ombudsman 's Special Report found that OLAF acted incorrectly in making accusations against a journalist .
<en> The Petitions Committee agreed to request an own-initiative report on this issue in order to pressure OLAF into accepting it had acted incorrectly .
<en> By voting for the PPE-DE amendment , we will be failing to defend the independence of journalists doing their work , failing to support the Petitions Committee in its work , and failing to support the Ombudsman in his work .

<en> ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted that - in spite of the technical problem - we all joined together to vote on the report confirming that the new Member States , including the Czech Republic , will be ready to join the Schengen area as early as 2008 .
<en> I appreciate the effort and openness of the Member States and the Commission during the intense technical consultations required prior to the enlargement .
<en> The enlarged Schengen area will no doubt present greater challenges for Europe 's internal security , but on the other hand , and I would like to emphasise this , it is the culmination of the efforts to achieve free movement in a truly integrated area .
<en> Next year Europe will be united as it has never been before .
<en> The Iron Curtain is definitely gone and I thank you for that .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Mr President , Poland 's accession to the Schengen area brings with it not only potential benefits linked to convenience in crossing borders , but also threats .
<en> One negative phenomenon that Poland has already been experiencing for a number of years is the difficulties encountered by citizens of our eastern neighbours in entering our country , including Poles living in Belarus and Ukraine .
<en> A lack of border controls may lead to many negative phenomena associated with criminality and illegal immigration .
<en> We are also concerned about action taken to remove national border controls in Member States in favour of pan-European EU border services .
<en> That is why I abstained from voting on this matter .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) As we have long argued , we consider that the areas of Justice and Home Affairs are central competences of States , particularly of the Portuguese State .
<en> We therefore oppose their progressive transfer to the supranational institutions of the EU in a process that justifies every new ' advance ' on the basis of the previous ' advance ' .
<en> Such is the case with the creation of the ' Schengen area ' with its Schengen acquis , which serves as a catalyst for the communitarisation of policies or measures linked to border control - visas , asylum or immigration - or police and judicial mechanisms .
<en> All the more so when such ' communitarisation ' happens in a framework in which the major EU powers , in concert , make sure that the decision-making process gives them the possibility of defending and safeguarding their interests , which is not the case for Portugal .
<en> As we have stated , essential international and European cooperation between sovereign States with equal rights concerning these matters is one thing , but the unacceptable handing over of fundamental elements for the safeguarding of national sovereignty and democracy to supranational institutions dominated by the major EU powers to create ' Fortress Europe ' is quite another .
<en> Hence our vote .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting against this report since , as I have already explained at length on several occasions , including recently , during my speeches in Parliament , I am firmly opposed to the Schengen Agreement .
<en> I am particularly opposed to it when this Agreement becomes the vehicle for illegal immigrants and dangerous movements within the EU .
<en> The borders of these countries that want to become part of the Schengen acquis are an easy target for criminals .
<en> They would provide another means of entry for uncontrolled immigration from former Soviet bloc countries and from the Middle East , . not to mention the social disorder that the free movement of citizens within the EU undeniably causes Italy and other countries .
<sp>
<2en> The Schengen cooperation must remain open to all Member States who wish to join and participate in the cooperation .
<2en> On the other hand , it is extremely important that all the countries participating in the cooperation already satisfy the requirements at the time of joining , because the cooperation entails a common external border .
<2en> If there are deficiencies in one country , Sweden has no way of checking the border protection .
<2en> The investigations made show that there are problems which need to be tackled , and the reasonable thing would be to delay joining until all the requirements have been satisfied .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this joint resolution , which notes that the right of free movement is a fundamental one accorded to all EU citizens .
<en> Member States have an obligation to look after the citizens of other Member States living in their territories , and to ensure dignity and respect for the rights of all citizens of the Union , no matter where they are living .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am strongly opposed to these motions for resolutions and want to express my firm opposition .
<en> This has all stemmed from belated and inconclusive action taken by the Italian government , which has realised that Italy is facing a crisis , unfortunately only following terrible incidents perpetrated by EU nationals .
<en> Directive 2004 / 38 / EC is clear when it says that ' All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State [ ... ] if they [ ... ] have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State ' .
<en> Therefore , these motions for resolution seem pointless and pretextual .
<en> The treaties impose freedom of movement of citizens within the EU and no one wants to engage in discrimination based on the country of origin .
<en> However , once EU citizens commit serious and execrable violent crimes in another Member State or if they are unable to give a reason for their visit , as the Directive requires , it is in the interests of the entire Union that they should be sent back to their own country .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of the resolution regarding free movement , initiated by PSE together with other political groups , because I consider it to be extremely important for the situation created in Italy not to create a dangerous precedent questioning the very respect of European Union fundamental principles .
<en> I believe this situation should be solved immediately in order not to allow the European Union citizens to be discriminated against , irrespective of their nationality .
<en> The measures proposed by the resolution will protect all European citizens from abuse .
<en> The EU needs all its citizens and Romanians should feel the solidarity of European people because there are thousands of Romanians working abroad who are appreciated for their hard work , honesty and correctness .
<en> The Union 's Charter to be annexed to the Reform Treaty lists the fundamental rights of European citizens : dignity , freedom , equality , solidarity , citizenship , justice .
<en> The EU guarantees democracy , rule of law , human rights , as well as the protection of minorities .
<en> In this context , the measures proposed by the resolution will contribute to the better integration of the Roma community .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) To reiterate what is said in the motion for a resolution , I , too , would like to congratulate the Portuguese Government for putting forward a proposal providing a technical transitional solution - SISone4all - which will allow the new Member States to be connected to the Schengen Information System in 2007 , before the Commission introduces the new Schengen Information System II .
<en> Congratulations are also due to the new Member States entering the Schengen area on the tremendous efforts they made to meet all the Schengen requirements in such a short period of time .
<en> Enlargement of the Schengen area to include nine new states from 21 December 2007 is also the richly deserved outcome of the European Parliament 's actions to stick to the original date .
<en> This is why I voted for this motion for a resolution .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) We voted against this resolution because we are opposed in principle to the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs , an area at the heart of state sovereignty .
<en> The ' Reform ' Treaty is an attempt to turn the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs into a common policy .
<en> Communitarisation - that is , the loss of national sovereignty - is all the more serious when it is promoted in a context characterised by Community policies and measures which dangerously compromise citizens ' rights , freedoms and guarantees that represent the progress of civilisation and fundamental democratic achievements .
<en> Consider the restrictive asylum policy and the increasing difficulties faced by asylum seekers in securing their rights and guarantees .
<en> Look at immigration policy with its security-orientated approach , its criminalisation of irregular immigrants , its inhuman ' detention centres ' and repatriation measures , its discriminatory , exploitative and predatory treatment of human resources from third countries .
<en> Note the growing use of information and the ever-increasing storage of data - including biometric data - available to a wider set of bodies , including third countries , for example the access of US bodies to air passenger data .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to express - both in a personal capacity and I hope , given what we witnessed , on behalf of my entire group - the strongest possible condemnation of the disgraceful , chauvinist , anti-European demonstration that was staged here earlier today .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> My group is certainly in favour of a referendum on the new treaty and it has questions and misgivings about certain articles of the Charter .
<en> But all that is quite unrelated to what took place here this morning and it is important that there should be no confusion .
<en> For our part , we support a Community of values , we support the promotion of fundamental rights , we support a Europe of democracy and there is no place in our vision for chauvinism and bad behaviour !
<en> ( Loud applause )
<sp>
<en> Madam President , on a point of order , I wish to make a formal request to safeguard the dignity of our House .
<en> The behaviour of certain Members of this House in shouting down representatives of Parliament , the Commission and the Council during the signing ceremony was intolerable and must not be tolerated .
<en> It brings the worst of the football stadium into Europe 's highest Chamber and recalls the actions of the Communists in the Russian Diet and the National Socialists in the German Reichstag .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> My formal request , Madam President , is this : my group demands that in future the Presidency use the powers granted to it under our Rules of Procedure to evict from the Chamber Members behaving in that fashion .
<en> ( Loud applause )
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Ladies and gentlemen , I think I need hardly add that we , like all our colleagues , were quite appalled by the demonstration earlier .
<en> I would say this , however : ' Do not over-dramatise !
<en> There may be 50 nutcases in the chamber but there are 700 Members who oppose them , so do not inflate the fact that 50 lame-brains disrupted the signing ceremony into an affair of state .
<en> Let us calm down and , Graham , let us not insist that those responsible be thrown out .
<en> In my view , a free Parliament is a Parliament that can tolerate a few nutcases , irksome though they might be .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> Madam President , on behalf of my own Group , whilst we all welcome the opportunity of a robust engagement , which should be allowed within any parliamentary assembly , what happened this morning went beyond what should be allowed to take place in any democratic institution .
<en> However , rather than prolong this argument , could we please get on with the vote and get to our lunch as soon as possible as well .

<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The presentation of the Council 's measures to combat climate change by Mr Barroso , President of the Commission , has the following aim and vision :
<en> to strengthen European monopolies in the intensified endo-imperialist competition in the field of energy .
<en> There is an attempt to exploit the essential goal of restricting emissions of pollutants in order to divide the markets and limit the growth of the emerging new powers ( China and Brazil ) , which are claiming greater shares of the market .
<en> It provides an outlet for the over-accumulation of capital through the commercialisation of environmental protection .
<en> Following the liberalisation of strategically important sectors ( energy , telecommunications ) , today 's economy is one of the great new investment outlets for monopolistic capital .
<en> For this reason Mr Barroso spoke about investment in innovative energy technologies , technological modernisation and the use of private groups to meet the requirements of the new environmental legislation .
<en> In addition , the Kyoto Protocol created a new capitalist market in emissions trading .
<en> The right to pollute is exchanged for a price on the carbon dioxide ' stock market ' .
<en> It nurtures a climate of class-based cooperation , attempting to exploit the worldwide raising of awareness , concealing the fact that dangerous changes in climate and global warming are the result of industrial development based on capitalist profit , the commercialisation of earth , air , energy , water , etc .
<en> These measures are detrimental to people 's needs and the development of the profitability of capital in the field of the environment .

<en> Therefore , the European Union 's commitment to decreasing greenhouse emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020 , particularly through measures in the energy sector , is a major step in combating global warming .
<en> Stepping up the transition to low-carbon energy by switching to biofuels and renewable energy sources will foster innovation and increase industrial competitiveness .
<en> Member States with developing economies , in particular Romania and Bulgaria , will be allowed a 20 % increase in emissions compared to 2005 for industries outside the ETS system , and this increase is to be computed on the basis of GDP .

<en> Union policy on energy aims , in a spirit of solidarity between Member States , to ensure security of energy supply in the Union .
<en> Experts have perceived a threat in South Stream to the Nabucco project , which is included in the EU Trans-European Energy Network .
<en> In my opinion , Bulgaria has acted in a very disappointing way by signing a bilateral agreement on energy with the Russian Federation .

<en> I call on the Commission to review the 2007-2013 financial perspective and the 2008 budget , Community programs and policies , as well as the main laws , so as to take climate change into account .
<en> The Commission should recognize the importance of national , local and regional authorities in the development and enforcement of climate change adjustment measures , as well as the need to vest authority in them and provide them with the support they need .

<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , too many animal sanctuaries in Europe basically serve only one purpose , and that is to dispose of stray cats and dogs .
<en> This sounds cruel in itself , but the real cruelty is only revealed in the methods deployed for this purpose , which entail every conceivable form of barbarity , from poisoning to starvation and clubbing to death .
<en> The worst aspect of this scenario , however , is that these cruel acts are not taking place far away in distant countries ; no , as committed activists from Austria have told me , they are happening right on our doorsteps .
<en> Cases of animal cruelty only recently came to light in the Czech Republic , for example .
<en> What is also worrying is the Commission 's brief and pithy statement that the protection of domestic animals still falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States .
<en> It seems that the Commission very often acts when it is not supposed to , and takes far too little action when it ought to .
<en> This situation must change , for a national competence does not mean that the EU should distance itself from an issue entirely .
<en> I therefore appeal to all Members not to kill off the issue of animal killing stations in their own countries by remaining silent .
<en> I also appeal to the Commission and the Council to condemn these cruel acts .

<en> Mr President , I am seriously concerned by the misconception that a colleague of mine , Sahra Wagenknecht , spread in an interview with the Russian news agency ' Regnum ' on 7 February this year .
<en> She accused the Estonian Government of disregarding human rights , and the European Union of conducting a silent cover-up with regard to the ' Bronze Night ' and the trials that followed in Estonia .
<en> I can assure you that the ongoing trials of the people accused of organising the riots are being carried out in accordance with the rule of law and with respect for human rights .
<en> I would also like to remind my colleague that one of the purposes of the state is to guard the sanctity of private property .
<en> The marauding in Tallinn last year had nothing to do with freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate .
<en> Criminal acts were committed , and that is why the state was obliged to intervene .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the Parliament in Kosovo declared independence yesterday .
<en> Serbia has therefore lost the cradle of its nationhood for the second time in history .
<en> I would remind the House that the Turks first seized this province from Serbia in the Middle Ages .
<en> In our times , supported by Member States of the Union and by our own silence , Serbia has once again suffered the loss of this territory , which is so precious to it .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , Kosovo 's declaration of independence constitutes a violation of international law on the inviolability and integrity of borders and countries .
<en> Kosovo 's declaration of independence also amounts to opening Pandora 's box , because it will foster extremism and nationalism and may fuel extremism of all kinds within Europe and beyond .
<en> We already have to deal , amongst other things , with similar claims in Ossetia , Nagorno-Karabakh and the Basque Country .
<en> This is a very ill-judged move as far as one particular Member State is concerned , namely Cyprus .
<en> How is that country supposed to respond ?
<en> Cyprus is striving for reunification at the same time as we are supporting separatist movements .

<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Russia will be holding presidential elections at the beginning of March , but there are few signs of a positive outcome being likely .
<en> What has happened in the run-up to these elections ?
<en> The opposition has been systematically obstructed and silenced , press freedom comprehensively curtailed , and the arrangements for the elections disrupted .
<en> Let me give you just one example : the Russian opposition politician Garry Kasparov , who is highly critical of the Kremlin , was arrested again by the police last week on completely spurious grounds .
<en> What will happen during the election ?
<en> There will be no transparency in these elections , for Russia has put obstacles in the way of election monitoring by the OSCE .
<en> What will happen after the election ?
<en> It is highly unlikely that the human rights situation will improve under a President Dmitry Medvedev enthroned by Putin .
<en> The EU must take action here .

<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , Kosovo 's independence signifies a major change in the Balkans .
<en> This step , albeit painful , seems to be another inevitable rung on the ladder towards settlement in the Balkans .
<en> As far as Kosovo 's future is concerned , we need a solution that will secure the collective and individual rights of an indigenous minority , the Serbs , and ensure that they can continue to live as a community in their historic birthplace .
<en> If some of them nevertheless wish to leave Kosovo , however , we must prevent them from going to areas of Serbia inhabited by other ethnic groups , such as the Albanian-populated southern areas or the Hungarian-populated northern regions .
<en> A mass influx of this sort would simply create new tensions between the Serbs , who are understandably irritated at present , and these minorities .
<en> By averting this risk we could facilitate another settlement that would include the long-term , and not merely superficial , regulation of relations between Belgrade and Novi Sad , and between the indigenous minorities in Vojvodina and the state ; it could also help to break the deadlock and enable a functioning state to be established in Bosnia .
<en> Desirable developments such as these would be fostered by the system of ethnic rights and tolerance that is now to be put in place in Kosovo .

<en> The next item is the report by Olle Schmidt , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 2003 / 96 / EC as regards the adjustment of special tax arrangements for gas oil used as motor fuel for commercial purposes and the coordination of taxation of unleaded petrol and gas oil used as motor fuel - C6-0109 / 2007 - .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I very much appreciate the support of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the Commission proposal and in particular the efforts of the rapporteur , Mr Schmidt , to find a compromise .
<en> As you know , the Commission proposal was presented in March 2007 .
<en> Our objective was to raise and approximate the minimum levels of excise duty on diesel and unleaded petrol in order to maintain the real value of the minima , and to approximate the national rates in order to significantly reduce what is known as ' fuel tourism ' .
<en> The reduction of fuel tourism would not only ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for the hauliers , but would reduce the extra kilometres and consequently the extra greenhouse gas emissions , which are detrimental to the environment .
<en> I should stress that , during the Council discussions , a large number of Member States have underlined the positive effect of the Commission proposal on the environment , particularly on climate change and global warming and the proper functioning of the internal market .
<en> As regards Mr Schmidt 's report , I appreciate very much the positive attitude to the Commission proposal taken in the report and the efforts made by the rapporteur to find a compromise position acceptable to all .
<en> However , the Commission cannot accept most of the amendments suggested in the report .
<en> Let me elaborate on it .
<en> The Commission is opposed to any suggestion that would undermine finding a long-term solution to the problem of fuel tourism - which is detrimental to the environment - and to the distortions of competition in the internal market .
<en> As regards the transitional periods suggested in our proposal , this approach is based on the principle of equal treatment of the old and new Member States and is , therefore , well-balanced in our view .
<en> The Commission , however , recognises that this is a political issue which will have to be discussed further in Council .
<en> I would also like to explain that the proposal takes into account the competitiveness aspect of the EU through the suggested modest rate increases .
<en> They simply maintain the real value of the minimum levels of taxation by keeping up with expected inflation until 2017 .
<en> The Commission considers that its own proposal takes all relevant factors into account .
<en> It does not consider it appropriate to endorse a less ambitious plan or a more far-reaching one to increase minimum levels of taxation as suggested in Amendments 18 and 25 .
<en> As regards Amendments 4 and 10 introducing a new definition of commercial diesel for motor vehicles not less than 3.5 t , I would like to clarify that the suggestion was not included in the original proposal .
<en> However , it is one of the main points of discussions in the Council where the Commission will follow the debate , bearing in mind the opinion expressed by the Parliament .
<en> The Commission can accept in principle Amendments 7 and 27 supporting the objective of reducing CO2 emissions .
<en> However , it should be remembered that according to the principle of subsidiarity , it is a matter for each Member State to decide the way in which they wish to distribute their tax revenue .
<en> In conclusion , I sincerely hope that Parliament can deliver a supportive opinion on the Commission proposal sending a positive signal to the Council to give a response to the concerns of Member States having problems with fuel tourism and , at the same time , achieving environmental objectives .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the fact that taxes at EU level are a sensitive subject is demonstrated by the work on this report .
<en> I thought that the broad consensus on the need to do something radical in order to cope with the demands of climate change would make it easier to gain sympathy for some really tough proposals .
<en> That was not how things turned out .
<en> Of course I can understand Mrs Rühle 's criticism of the level of ambition , but at the same time the work in our Parliament focuses on reaching reasonable compromises - something the Commissioner also mentioned - which can be implemented throughout our Union .
<en> Here I yielded to arguments regarding both the scale of the tax increases and the period of implementation .
<en> Excellent cooperation from my colleagues , Mr Becsey and Mr Rosati , led me to realise that , if we were to get a report through at all , I had to adjust the level without the purpose of my original proposals being entirely frustrated .
<en> The Commission 's proposal was rejected in its entirety .
<en> I did not gain everything , but nor did I lose everything .
<en> Navigating between the rocks of Luxembourg and the Greens was not an altogether simple matter .
<en> Emissions from transport are increasing substantially .
<en> We must do something about that .
<en> The fact that the EU Member States are competing with different levels of tax on diesel is therefore neither reasonable nor right , as the Commissioner correctly indicates .
<en> No one can think that it is good for the internal market that giant lorries should make long detours in order to fill up with cheap diesel in places such as Luxembourg .
<en> This so-called fuel tourism is not only bad for the environment , it distorts competition as well .
<en> Besides , it leads to losses of tax revenue .
<en> Moreover , there is no reason to have separate taxes on unleaded petrol and diesel .
<en> So a compromise was reached here , which got more or less unanimous support in the committee .
<en> The minimum taxes on diesel are raised more slowly than proposed by the Commission , from 302 euros per 1 000 litres at present to the same level as the tax on unleaded petrol , 359 euros per 1 000 litres , by 2015 .
<en> The Commission wanted to see an increase already in 2012 .
<en> Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Bulgaria and Romania would be given until 1 January 2016 to introduce the higher minimum tax .
<en> The Commission wants to raise the minimum tax to 380 euros per 1 000 litres by 2014 .
<en> In order to avoid further distortion of competition , the committee considers that those countries which have tax rates of over 400 euros per 1 000 litres on diesel and 500 euros per 1 000 litres on unleaded petrol should not raise their tax rates on these fuels before 2015 .
<en> Mr President , Commissioner , clearly this is a very sensitive question , in particular having regard to subsidiarity .
<en> Nevertheless it is a possible way forward towards increased convergence of tax levels .
<en> At the same time , we know that inevitable environmental demands will exert an influence on future assessments of the use of financial controls .
<en> To those who do not think I have been sufficiently tough in my demands and that I have chipped away at the level of ambition I will say : in substance , I am with you .
<en> We should have agreed on higher levels and shorter implementation periods , as the Commission and the Commissioner have said , but the EU today is not the same EU as it was only five years ago - happily , I would add .
<en> The economic preconditions for harmonising taxes are not the same as they were .
<en> If we are to tackle cross-border emissions , we must find reasonable compromises with which everyone can live .
<en> We must all realise that .
<en> Besides , I would add that many of the old Member States merit criticism since they have not followed decisions on tax increases taken previously .
<en> Purchasing power and inflation considerations have also been taken into account in the committee 's conclusions .
<en> The price of oil is currently hitting new records .
<en> I last heard on the news that it was close to 110 dollars a barrel .
<en> Now there is broad agreement on gradual tax convergence which I also hope the Commissioner sees - at least in the committee - and I hope to get the support of my colleagues in the House tomorrow , broad support so that we can get a report that can serve as a basis for further work .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE group . - ( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
<en> I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Schmidt , on his excellent work .
<en> I believe today represents a breakthrough , as we have managed to hammer out a common parliamentary position on a broad consensual basis .
<en> I think it is important to preserve here in plenary the common voice we found in our committee .
<en> It is a success because we managed to set a minimum and maximum rate of excise duty to meet anti-inflationary objectives but ignored the idea of abolishing regulation in its entirety .
<en> It is better to have an opinion than not to provide one at all , which would leave only the Commission proposal on the table .
<en> It is a success because everyone is sacrificing something .
<en> Countries with high rates of taxation are ready to freeze their current high rates in the interests of convergence , while low-rate countries are willing to accept some increase relative to the legislation currently in force in relation to diesel .
<en> The biggest sacrifice in this regard is being made by the newly acceded Baltic and Balkan states , as prices and incomes in these countries are lower and they have taken on a huge challenge in terms of inflation and competitiveness , and also in the social sphere , particularly in the run-up to introducing the euro .
<en> It is a success because it would halt Parliament 's request show , its ' cherry-picking ' .
<en> By the end of 2015 everyone would fall within the proposed band , and there would no longer be a whole series of inexplicable individual exceptions .
<en> This will enable us to reinforce the gravitas of European legislation .
<en> I think discipline is important , and we therefore ask the Commission to provide an interim report on compliance in 2010 , to check whether the adjusters are actually adjusting or merely dissembling .
<en> It is a success because the Council will see that there is a way to achieve the desired convergence , while the Commission will grasp Parliament 's philosophy , namely minimum and maximum rates , with the key point being to reduce rather than induce inflation .
<en> It can reflect on this in future , too , when putting forward the scheduled Commission proposal on excise duties .
<en> Thank you for your attention , Mr President .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the Commission 's proposal on taxation of unleaded petrol and diesel oil is aimed at limiting the excessive use of fuel in transport and thus reducing environmental pollution .
<en> The Commission also hopes that its proposal will assist in reducing the differences in the excise duty rates imposed by individual Member States , thus contributing to creating more equal conditions for competition on the single market .
<en> In general , these aims are desirable and merit support .
<en> At the same time , however , the Commission 's proposal contains solutions that may have negative implications for the economies of the Member States .
<en> The former include : additional increases in the cost of fuel and increased inflation , higher costs and a reduction in the competitiveness of European enterprises , and a reduction of the purchasing power of households .
<en> These implications may be particularly noticeable when oil prices on the world markets are exceptionally high , as is the case at present .
<en> In addition , the Commission 's proposals are such that the main burden of adjustment to the new rates would have to be borne by the least developed Member States of the Union , which is a matter of great concern : hence the amendments proposed in Mr Schmidt 's report , which are aimed at minimising such negative implications , whilst not undermining the main aims of the Commission 's proposals .
<en> In the framework of the compromise reached between the main groups , we call for the introduction of three main changes to the Commission 's initial draft .
<en> Firstly , we propose reducing the target minimum rate of excise duty on fuel from EUR 380 per 1 000 litres to EUR 359 per 1 000 litres .
<en> Secondly , we propose a two-year extension of the transitional period for introduction of the new rates in the new Member States , taking it to 2016 .
<en> Thirdly , we propose imposing a requirement whereby the Member States that currently impose the highest excise duty rates on fuel would undertake not to raise them before 2015 , thus facilitating the process of harmonising excise duty rates .
<en> Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to emphasise that reaching a compromise was no easy task .
<en> It called for concessions and a display of good will on the part of all those who participated in discussions within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
<en> I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Schmidt for his hard work on this compromise and congratulate him on the successful outcome .
<en> Clearly this compromise does not fully satisfy everyone involved , but it does represent an attempt to reconcile a range of aims and points of view .
<en> It also represents a step forward along the way to reducing differences in rates of excise duty within the Union .
<en> I call on the Members of the House to support this compromise and adopt the Schmidt report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Madam President , many thanks to Riitta Myller for her excellent report and for her cooperation .
<en> As the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety says , the implementation of the EU 's Environment Programme is in many respects late , but what is even more startling is that , even if all the concrete targets set thus far were fully achieved , the EU would still not be on the road to sustainable development .
<en> For example , we probably will not manage to halt the decline in biodiversity by 2010 , even if we are committed to doing so .
<en> The unpleasant truth is that our society is constructed to work in a way that is unsustainable .
<en> If everyone on earth consumed resources the way Europeans do , we would need four earths to produce the necessary resources .
<en> If the middle classes of China , India and other developing countries copy our consumption habits the planet will be in crisis .
<en> I hope that the wake-up call that is now on its way thanks to climate policy will result in a more comprehensive reassessment of our lifestyle and production habits .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Thank you , Madam President .
<en> Let me begin by saying that I , too , disagree that implementation of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme is going according to plan .
<en> Moreover , in many cases concrete quantitative and qualitative targets and timetables are lacking , not only in the Action Programme , but also in the thematic strategies .
<en> There is no doubt that implementation of the Sixth Action Programme is behind schedule ; we have not yet managed to meet the priority environmental objectives set out in the Programme , and implementation of the legislation in the Member States keeps stalling .
<en> Let me give you a concrete example .
<en> First : no concrete steps have been taken to draft legislation concerning indoor air quality .
<en> A particular priority in this regard is the drafting of provisions relating to schools and other public indoor spaces used by vulnerable groups .
<en> At the very least , pilot projects should be initiated .
<en> Second : implementation of directives on the Natura 2000 networking programme has also stalled .
<en> Best practice needs to be disseminated , and fiscal measures put in place against polluters .
<en> I myself have approached the Commission with a submission relating to contamination of Natura 2000 areas , but the Commission has merely been sitting on its hands and has not taken any action .
<en> Third : illegal dumping of hazardous and municipal waste in the territory of other countries has proliferated in recent times .
<en> Africa and Asia are often the destination of European waste , and this is unacceptable .
<en> Equally unacceptable is the fact that several German Länder are illegally transporting many thousands of tonnes of waste to eastern Europe , and then refuse to take it back - take the case of Bavaria , for example .
<en> Fourth : whatever happened to the fine principle of preventing cross-border pollution ?
<en> One Member State , Austria , has been polluting the River Raba for the past seven years , as Mr Hegyi mentioned earlier .
<en> Thick foam floats on the surface of the river .
<en> I have raised this issue at least half a dozen times already , and indeed I have also made a formal complaint , but to no avail : the foam on the river remains , while the Commission sits there doing nothing .
<en> Fine principles are meaningless unless they are implemented .
<en> The Commission is the guardian of European Union law .
<en> It is time for this guardian to do its duty and not give in to Member States , but instead to ensure compliance with the laws that we have jointly adopted .
<en> Thank you very much .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
<en> I think it reflects Parliament 's concerns about how much the Union has so far abided by its commitments within the framework of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme .
<en> The Commission 's mid-term review reveals that coordinated efforts are required to plug the gaps in legislation with new legislative proposals .
<en> It is also necessary to secure the requisite resources to ensure proper implementation of Community legislation .
<en> Meanwhile , it is becoming understood that a greater reliance has to be placed on a sustainable model of production and consumption , and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resources .
<en> It is just as important to emphasise the international dimension of European environmental policy .
<en> The Union must be encouraged to continue promoting ambitious environmental policies and requirements , and to develop technology transfer and the exchange of good practice with developing countries .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , I really do not think that the document that we are considering is what it could be , and I will explain : it is a document to assess what has been done with the broad guidelines that the European Commission had proposed for the environment , and for all environmental policy .
<en> I do not think that it is an assessment document .
<en> It is not a detailed assessment document that could have helped us to plan for the future , perhaps because the Commission is not accustomed to being judged or assessed , nor does it vote , or have a group of shareholders that demand results from it .
<en> I do think , however , although it may appear to be a contradiction , that the Commission can be congratulated on the results that it has had in recent years , but not on the document .
<en> I think that environmental policy has been absolutely integrated into municipal and regional policies , and industry itself is responding to the European Union guidelines .
<en> However , the document lacks a projection of how we need to change for the future , because those points where the system has not worked well need to be reviewed .
<en> Europe has been making environmental policy for more than 25 years and it needs to review some of its methods , because this is not the only thing that explains the failure of some policies .
<en> I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks , whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude .
<en> There are now many countries , as happened with the Soil Directive , that already have much better regulations than Europe can give them and others that do not have any .
<en> In response to this imbalance , Europe needs to take different positions and look for new ways of working , because it is logical that , if the world has changed , we should change our working methods .
<en> Thank you very much , congratulations on the results but let us change in the future .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) In my opinion , it is very important that the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme has brought to light an important fact : implementation of this programme is running well behind the planned schedule .
<en> As a result , the likelihood that everything will be done by 2012 and that the priority goals will be met is rather low .
<en> I share the opinion that clearer and more tangible quantitative and qualitative goals still need to be incorporated into the programme .
<en> I also agree that the submission of thematic strategies has not generated effective results .
<en> For this reason , I would stress the need for further efforts to eliminate loopholes in environmental laws by means of new legislative proposals .
<en> It is also very important to ensure the effective implementation of environmental regulations .
<en> Climate change , biodiversity , health and resource use will continue to be among our most urgent challenges for the future .

<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Commissioner , forgive me , but I was very deeply shocked by your introduction to this debate .
<en> You told us that the Commission had held a dispassionate debate on crimes against humanity .
<en> You spoke of how complex this task is , and , in conclusion , you said that the European Union had very few powers in this area .
<en> When she was two months old , the wife of your Estonian colleague , Sim Kallas , with whom you are well acquainted , was deported by Stalin , along with her mother and grandmother .
<en> Another of your colleagues , Mr Frattini , who will soon be leaving us , said in his letter to Mr Landsbergis : ' Your history - referring to Lithuania 's suffering under Stalin - your history is our history . '
<en> Commissioner , in your reply , perhaps you could explain things in greater depth , as it may be that I have misunderstood .
<en> I believe that it is here in Parliament and in the Council that a great deal has been done to remember the forgotten dead .
<en> For we do not talk like politicians ; we address the general public .
<en> There are people still living today in Poland and in the Baltic States who have lost their parents , their grandparents , but no one remembers them .
<en> I do not believe that a debate on the suffering of six million Jews can be dispassionate .
<en> Therefore , the length of such a debate and the manner in which it is conducted are extremely important factors .
<en> As your colleague would say , the history of central and eastern Europe is our history .
<en> The problem for us British and for us French is that we were Stalin 's allies at the end of the War .
<en> It took 30 years for the British to admit that Katyn was a Stalinist crime .
<en> The perpetrator was not Hitler .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , we Social Democrats have been persecuted by every totalitarian and authoritarian regime of the 20th century , whether by the Nazis or by the thugs of Stalin , Franco or Mussolini - the list is long .
<en> That is why we not only have no problem with but actually welcome a reappraisal of the crimes under Stalinism .
<en> We can only applaud it .
<en> Yet this reappraisal should follow the rules of historical methodology and not be confused with the rules governing criminal court proceedings .
<en> We must guard against confusing these matters .
<en> It is not a question of counting up the victims or of a re-run of the Nuremberg Trials ; this time we are trying an ideology rather than identified criminals .
<en> There are , however , also points at which we must quite clearly say ' no ' and we Social Democrats have identified a few of them .
<en> We say ' no ' to the attempt to establish a new framework for interpreting European history , which emerged from the speeches made by some Members of this House at a conference held on 22 January this year .
<en> We are deeply opposed to the view that the extermination of European Jews by the Nazis came from a conception of history that was developed by the Soviet regime .
<en> We reject that view .
<en> We reject it all the more firmly because in 2006 we found that another colleague from the same ideological spectrum sent a roundmail to all Members of this House in which he described the two Latvian Waffen-SS divisions as part of the German forces , thereby playing down their role .
<en> We reject that interpretation too , especially in connection with the first sentence .
<en> We also reject the assertion that the West did nothing to bring about change in what was then the Soviet-ruled part of Europe .
<en> It was the CSCE in Helsinki that first gave the civil rights movements in those countries room to breathe , with the successful and happy result we see today as we welcome representatives from those countries to our House .
<en> These are points we insist on and will continue to pursue .
<sp>
<en> ( LV ) Mr President , at the European Parliament we are accustomed to talk about common values , about a common and truthful history , but sometimes misunderstandings arise .
<en> Commissioner Barrot , I think that you said rightly that in Europe it is still necessary to establish the truth .
<en> What we are talking about is reconciliation , but perhaps not to the extent that Mr Cohn-Bendit has proposed .
<en> Thank you , though , to Commissioner Frattini for the hearing that was organised .
<en> I was able to participate and also on various occasions to speak in the hearing .
<en> I think that the debate was pithy .
<en> Unfortunately , what was missing was a clear , resolute , focused statement on further action .
<en> Unfortunately , Russian representatives repeatedly continued to explain away the crimes committed by totalitarian communism in the territories occupied by the USSR .
<en> Russia 's reaction is no surprise , but what will the European Union do ?
<en> Will it continue to maintain double standards ?
<en> Will it demand the acknowledgement of Nazi crimes in the denial of events or their gross trivialisation in the Member States ?
<en> Will it demand that custodial sentences of up to three years be imposed ?
<en> Will it , at the same time , turn a blind eye to the crimes of the USSR 's totalitarian regime ?
<en> Some of the victims of the Soviet totalitarian regime are still alive , but the European Union 's position does not offer them any satisfaction - in fact , worse than that , it continues to humiliate them .
<en> We are talking about EU citizens .
<en> The European Parliament ought to range itself against such injustice .
<en> Unfortunately , we repeatedly see the chairs of the political groups deciding not to table a resolution on this issue .
<en> Therefore , we cannot have a written record of the thoughts we are expressing here today .
<en> Commissioner Barrot , I call upon you not to depart from this important goal , but to strive for a uniform understanding and truthful history in the name of reconciliation .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , the anti-Ceauşescu uprising in Romania started at my church .
<en> I have had painful experience of what communism really is and it is therefore with a sense of satisfaction that I note that the European Union 's attention is once again focused on the criminal actions of totalitarian regimes .
<en> In cases of crimes against humanity committed in the eras of national socialism and communism the world still applies a double standard .
<en> Unlike the case of fascism , there has yet been no trial of communism .
<en> Both types of dictatorial regime suppressed freedom , human rights and churches .
<en> They crippled the lives of their national minorities .
<en> The huge scale of human and social tragedy is common to fascism and communism .
<en> Political , historical , human and moral restitution has hardly begun and must be continued .
<en> Take the example of Romania and the Tismăneanu report .
<en> It is my conviction that , for the regime change begun there in 1989 to be complete , the events of the past must be confronted .
<en> Real European integration of former communist countries requires not just truth and restitution but also the condemnation of dictatorship .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , in just the same way as the Baltic Sea became an internal EU sea in 2004 , so the historical experiences of the 10 new Member States that suffered under the totalitarian rule of communism have become an all-European problem .
<en> I absolutely agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit : we need a uniform or common interpretation of our common history .
<en> So it is not a question of condemnation ; it is a question of moral and political assessment of all the crimes .
<en> We are called upon to guarantee that all crimes against humanity , all acts of genocide and classicide and all war crimes should be treated equally .
<en> Justice belongs to all citizens of Europe without any exception .
<en> In that sense , I am a bit disappointed with the Commission statement , because the main theme is that the assessment of communist totalitarianism will be an internal affair for every relevant country .
<en> I am afraid it is going to deepen double standards , because clearly Nazism and fascism are not considered to be internal matters in any of the EU Member States .
<en> Every emergence of neo-Nazism and racism is viewed as a direct threat to the common values of Europe .
<en> So , what do we need to do ?
<en> There are still tens of millions of living victims of communist regimes , as well as their descendents .
<en> As things stand today , they are bound to feel like second- or third-class victims .
<en> The famous ' never again ' is still not guaranteed for them .
<en> Lastly , this is not a problem of the past .
<en> The absence of a political and moral assessment is continuously shaping our present day and is distorting our common future .
<en> Could one imagine the return of the Soviet KGB leadership to power in Russia or a revival of communist political forces in Germany if there had been an assessment of the communist system at the end of the Cold War ?

<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although the use of human organs for transplantation has increased steadily over recent decades , the number of individuals who need transplants exceeds the number of organs available .
<2en> Over 50 000 patients are on waiting lists in Europe , and 10 people , awaiting organs die every day .
<2en> It is up to us to send a strong message to the Commission , and , above all , to Member States and our governments .
<2en> The time has come to take action as European citizens .
<2en> We need to mobilise , coordinate , raise awareness among those around us and become donors ourselves .
<2en> ( Applause )
<2en> - Before the vote on paragraph 38 :
<sp>
<en> Mr President , very briefly , this is a short amendment to make Amendment 2 to paragraph 38 stronger in its meaning with respect to the rights of the donor .
<en> The amendment is to add , after ' donate an organ ' , the words ' is the exclusive right of the donor and ' .
<en> ( Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )

<en> Subject : EU anti-discrimination legislation
<en> Under current EU legislation , it is only in the field of employment and vocational training that EU citizens are protected against discrimination on grounds of age , religion or belief , disability and sexual orientation , whilst in the fields of education , social protection and access to goods and services , discrimination legislation only applies on grounds of racial or ethnic origin .
<en> As legislation is broadened to include more categories in the goods and services field , what consideration has the Commission given to the unintended consequences this may cause ?
<en> For example , in any new legislation , what safeguards has the Commission considered to ensure that reductions for elderly people and concessionary groups are not adversely affected ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union has established a broad framework for the fight against discrimination and can be proud of the results that have been achieved .
<en> However , some groups enjoy a higher level of protection than others .
<en> Specifically this means that people are protected against discrimination on grounds of age , disability , sexual orientation or religion but it is only in the workplace that they are protected in this complex manner .
<en> Only the scope of protection against discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin and gender is wider .
<en> As announced in the Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2008 , the Commission is planning a proposal for a directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , implementing the principle of equal treatment outside employment and broadening the existing EU legal framework .
<en> The decisions on the details have yet to be made : for example , we are awaiting the results of an impact study that is currently being carried out and these results will be available soon .
<en> However , the Commission understands the need to achieve the balance the principles of non-discrimination and preferential treatment ; under certain circumstances the latter may be justified .
<en> Several types of preferential treatment exist in the Member States and they offer special treatment to certain groups for specific reasons without being discriminatory .
<en> An example of preferential treatment is free travel on public transport for older people : this supports mobility .
<en> The Commission does not deem these practices illegal if they have a legitimate basis in national law for social , educational , cultural or other reasons .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for that assurance at the end of his statement that the Commission does not intend that what he described as ' preferential treatment ' will be adversely affected .
<en> I think that is welcome .
<en> If the work as he describes it continues and he can strike the right balance , I think that will be welcome in all countries in the European Union .
<en> I thank him for that assurance .
<en> Whilst I have the floor , on a related matter , does the Commissioner have any idea when he expects to publish his proposal on a decision to accede to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , which of course fits into this same category ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was completed during the Luxembourg Presidency , thanks , too , to the coordinated endeavours of the European Union .
<en> I am certain that this Convention would not have been concluded without our efforts .
<en> Of course ratification of the Convention is the responsibility of the Member States and the European Union aims to support and accelerate this ratification through its discussions with the Member States .
<en> Regarding your question as to when I expect to publish the proposal , the provisional deadline is the end of June this year , but that is really is only a provisional date .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to direct the Commissioner to religious discrimination and to the amazing fact that , despite the EU 's protection against religious discrimination , there is one place in the EU where religious discrimination is permitted .
<en> Sadly it is my constituency of Northern Ireland where by reason of a derogation from EU legislation - permitted by the EU - it is expressly declared that it is lawful to discriminate against Protestants when it comes to recruiting to the Police Service of Northern Ireland .
<en> Can the Commissioner tell us when this preposterous situation will end and the rights which others enjoy will be restored to my constituents ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) Madam President , I believe that we should reasonably be able to ask questions about how we are to interpret the Treaty , which is now being presented under another name but is the same , and that the Council ought then to be able to answer the question .
<en> My supplementary question now to Question No 3 is : Does this wording mean that the EU will decide not only the objectives of global environmental policy but also the means , the means the Member States are to use to achieve the objective ?
<sp>
<en> ( SL ) The question as to how similar or different the Lisbon Treaty is to or from the former Constitutional Treaty is primarily down to personal impressions .
<en> It is a different treaty from the Constitutional Treaty but offers some similar or even identical solutions .
<en> I will limit myself to the following facts .
<en> It is different inasmuch as it is not the kind of treaty that supersedes all previous treaties .
<en> This is a classic method of adapting fundamental European Union treaties .
<en> It is different in the sense that the constitution concept has been dropped and there is no longer talk of a European Union Constitution , but of a classic treaty .
<en> Similarities or equivalents are to be found in numerous solutions , including institutional solutions , functional solutions and solutions in the areas of simplification , the adoption of decisions and an increased role for the national parliaments and the European Parliament .
<en> Therefore , the treaty is different from the previous Constitutional Treaty , but offers some similar or even identical solutions .
<en> As regards the second question : I paid special attention to the language of Mrs Goudin 's question and I would like to point out that this provision concerns the Union 's support in shaping international measures to preserve and improve the quality of the environment , sustainable development and so on .
<en> In other words , the Union does not prescribe or order , but helps .
<en> I think this language speaks for itself .
<sp>
<en> I am going to take one more supplementary question on this particular question .
<en> We have had a whole spate of indications , but I take into account political balance and who has asked a question already .
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) The wording cited by Mrs Goudin is good , and it is fantastic that we want to protect and improve the environment , that is good wording in the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> The constant problem with the EU 's environmental policy is when environmental measures conflict with the internal market .
<en> Recently Commissioner Verheugen stated that in the past five years the Commission has taken Member States to the European Court of Justice a whole 19 times in cases where Member States have legislated to protect the environment .
<en> In all 19 cases the court ruled in favour of the internal market and against the environment .
<en> I am wondering whether this in any way strengthens the environmental guarantee ?
<en> With this wording , can we say that the environment takes precedence over the demands of the market ?
<en> Could you issue a statement on this please ?
<sp>
<en> ( SL ) Yes , I would like to say to Mr Holm that I totally agree with him .
<en> It is absolutely the case that there are clashes between legal norms in different areas , even when it comes to the nature of the legal norm .
<en> That norm or that provision of the Lisbon Treaty , which I repeat is not yet in force , talks about the Union 's support .
<en> The nature of the legal norm is different from an order or a ban .
<en> The largest number of orders or bans can actually be found in the common market .
<en> It is a fact that there is the possibility of a clash , but it is also a fact that it is in the nature of things for these clashes to be resolved by the Court in accordance with current Community law .
<en> There is a way of eliminating the risk of a clash when formulating the legal norms , but that is a matter for the European Commission , which alone has the right of legislative initiative .
<en> I am convinced that when it takes that initiative it is careful to avoid any potential clashes .
<en> Subject : Lisbon Treaty
<en> Is the Council satisfied that questions submitted by the Slovenian Presidency to the Member States , which included thirty-three points on the Lisbon Treaty that needed clarification , have been adequately responded to ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) I should also like to express the extreme concern that the agricultural sector in the Azores , my region , has about the current situation .
<en> I believe it has been shown in this debate that nothing can justify the existence of a policy which prohibits the use of GMOs in animal feed at the same time as allowing the consumption of meat produced using these GMOs .
<en> I also believe that the exaggeration existing in the zero tolerance policy has been made clear .
<en> Finally , I should like to say that anyone who knows the animal feed industry cannot doubt the obvious impact that both these factors will have on food prices .
<en> This impact is very clear , particularly for corn gluten feed and the waste from using maize to produce alcohol .
<en> I have already called on the European Commission to take account of the situation of farmers throughout Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the agriculture debate , we currently face the challenge posed by the Health Check .
<en> I would be interested to hear whether the GMO debate plays a role , and to what extent it is being discussed , in that context .
<en> We all know that there is a heated debate worldwide about the food / energy security issue at present .
<en> We need to see what implications this debate has for us .
<en> I myself am always in favour of zero tolerance when it comes to labelling .
<en> It should be clear to the consumer what he or she is buying .
<en> From that perspective , we should ensure that the legislative bodies at regional level also have a chance to decide on this issue .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , even at this late time of the day , listening to the debate , I feel the need to say just three things .
<en> First of all , it is true that there is no scientific evidence that GMOs pose a hazard to human or animal health .
<en> However , as a previous speaker , who has now gone , mentioned , asbestos was not thought to be hazardous and , yet , we know today that it causes mesothelioma - lung cancer .
<en> And , of course , smoking was not thought to be hazardous to anybody until a few years ago and now , of course , we know that it causes lung cancer , pulmonary disease and coronary artery stenosis .
<en> So it is better to be safe than sorry .
<en> Secondly , Mr Allister and Mr Casaca talked about the difference between GMOs in feed and animals that have been fed on GMOs .
<en> There is a large difference between the two .
<en> There is a difference , because , in the feed , the GMO is in a completely different state from the GMO that has been fed to the animal , digested by the animal and metabolised by the animal , and then is just , probably , present - but it is not - in the animal 's meat in a completely different form than in the feed .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , it is clear that this topic of genetically modified organisms is a democratic urgency , an economic necessity and a legal imperative .
<en> I congratulate our committee for tackling the subject .
<en> As far as our debate is concerned , it is clear that the European Union is highly dependent on imports of protein-rich feedingstuffs .
<en> That goes back to the scientific debates , and the import of animals fed with feed that does not comply with the European rules leads us to wonder whether the European Union is capable of protecting its citizens .
<en> The protection regime is not protectionism , it is simply a question , and I would like to ask the Commission if it feels that the quality of our customs system , which has in my view deteriorated considerably , would allow it to respond to all of the considerations raised in this excellent debate .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , when the Commissioner answers , could she say something about the possibilities of increasing the tolerance level from zero to a higher percentage , say 0.7 % , 0.9 % or whatever it is ?
<en> From listening to the debate , I think that is the essence of what has been said .
<en> Zero tolerance in the present circumstances is a bit too stringent .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Questions 35 to 39 will receive written answers .
<en> Subject : Accession negotiations with Croatia
<en> Does the Commission think that the accession negotiations with Croatia can be completed by the end of the year ?
<en> What is the exact timetable for the rest of the year ?
<en> Subject : Progress of the accession of Croatia into the European Union
<en> Can the European Commission give a statement outlining the state of play with regard to Croatia 's application to accede into the European Union ?
<en> Subject : Conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia
<en> Since the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia the country has already made substantial progress , leading to the opening of many negotiation chapters , and is well on the way to meeting the benchmarks for opening and closing further chapters .
<en> Above all , there have been positive developments in connection with the alignment of Croatian law with EU standards , protection for minorities and efforts to bring about judicial reform .
<en> In addition , through its recent decision not to introduce the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone Croatia has cleared the way for faster progress in the accession negotiations .
<en> These welcome developments are acknowledged in Parliament 's report on Croatia 's 2007 progress report , paragraphs 31 and 32 of which call for enhanced support for Croatia from the EU , and in particular from the Commission .
<en> How will the Commission step up the support it provides ?
<en> Provided that Croatia meets the relevant criteria , will the Commission put forward , in autumn 2008 , a provisional timetable for the conclusion of the accession negotiations in 2009 ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , Mr Posselt , Mr Crowley and Mr Ebner have all asked about the state of play of accession negotiations with Croatia and I can respond to them jointly .
<en> These negotiations with Croatia are progressing well overall .
<en> So far negotiations have been opened on 18 chapters out of 35 and we have closed two of these chapters .
<en> As regards opening benchmarks , 11 sets of benchmarks have been set .
<en> The Commission has assessed the benchmarks as being met in seven of these 11 cases .
<en> In these cases our recommendations are now under discussion among the Member States in the Council or negotiation positions are being prepared .
<en> In the remaining chapters , such as competition policy and public procurement , opening benchmarks were already set by the Union in the first half of 2006 - that is two years ago .
<en> But Croatia has been slow in taking the necessary measures to meet these opening benchmarks .
<en> Croatia is still working on opening benchmarks for the chapter on the judiciary and fundamental rights , where there are many difficult challenges in areas such as judicial reform , the fight against corruption and refugee return .
<en> While Croatia has done plenty of good work aligning with the key 16 chapters where we have closing benchmarks , Croatia has not done enough at this stage to meet all closing benchmarks in any of these 16 chapters .
<en> With the remaining conditions still to be met by Croatia it unrealistic to assume that accession negotiations could be concluded this year in 2008 .
<en> Croatia has nonetheless made good progress overall and therefore 2008 could be a decisive year in Croatia 's EU accession negotiations .
<en> Provided a number of conditions are met by Croatia , the Commission will in this autumn 's enlargement package present an indicative timetable or a conditional roadmap for the conclusion of other technical negotiations in the course of 2009 .
<en> The first condition to be met is that Croatia should meet all opening benchmarks by June this year , i.e. next month .
<en> Secondly , Croatia must comply with all legal obligations under the stabilisation and accession agreement and it must also continue to comply with the general conditionalities of the stabilisation and accession process .
<en> And thirdly , Croatia needs urgently to improve its management of EU financial assistance under the PHARE and IPA programmes .
<en> The President of the Commission will continue to provide substantial financial and technical assistance for Croatia in order to help it fulfil the requirements of EU membership .
<en> Once sufficient progress has been made by Croatia in meeting opening or closing benchmarks , the Commission will prepare and submit in good time the necessary recommendations to the Member States for the positions to be taken in the intergovernmental conference .
<en> So , in a nutshell , ultimately the pace of progress of Croatia towards the European Union will be determined by its own ability to meet all necessary conditions .
<en> Thus we can work and progress on the basis of Croatia 's own merits .
<sp>
<en> - ( DE ) Commissioner , you know my position - that Croatia should have become a Member long ago , if justice prevailed .
<en> However , I am not expressing my personal point of view here , but that of this House .
<en> Parliament said that negotiations should be completed by 2009 at the latest .
<en> At its meeting in Croatia a few weeks ago , the Joint Parliamentary Committee said that all chapters should be opened under the Slovenian Presidency and closed under the French or , at the latest , the Czech Presidency .
<en> Does the Commission believe that this schedule is realistic and what is it doing to speed things up ?
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response .
<en> Two points .
<en> First of all , with regard to the judicial and fundamental rights chapter where there appears to be a lot of difficulties concerning the negotiations : how best can we help Croatia to advance on that side of it ?
<en> Secondly , concerning the distribution of the PHARE programme money and the management of those monies : where are the biggest pitfalls that the Croatia financial management system has to overcome ?
<en> Thirdly , going back to what my colleague Bernd Posselt said , we thought there was an agreement that this would be concluded very quickly .
<en> If there are still 17 chapters which have yet to be opened for negotiation , how can we proceed at the pace that we want to see happening ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Thank you for these very pertinent and important follow-up questions .
<en> The Commission is working with Croatia as it would with any other candidate country so that we follow the negotiating framework adopted in unanimity by the Council and by the Member States .
<en> It is our task and responsibility to monitor progress in meeting the benchmarks on the basis of our rather new benchmark methodology , which was created and adopted at the end of 2006 - with very strong support by Parliament - in order to improve the quality of the EU accession process .
<en> This means that once a country is able to open one benchmark and then close the same benchmark it has proved that it has made sufficient progress in the issues concerned .
<en> I give you one very concrete example : that is the shipbuilding sector in Croatia .
<en> We expect that Croatia will provide a very concrete restructuring strategy for the whole sector , as well as for all the individual shipyards concerned in this sector .
<en> There was a meeting recently between the Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia and my colleague Neelie Kroes , the European Commissioner for Competition , to scrutinise the state of affairs in this regard .
<en> We are still waiting for somewhat more convincing efforts by the Croatian authorities to show that Croatia will be able to restructure its shipbuilding sector properly so that we can move forward in the field of competition policy where state aid is a very critical benchmark .
<en> This is to prove that it really is in the hands of the Croatian Government and the authorities to meet the benchmarks .
<en> We always knew that some of the benchmarks were more challenging than others and the Commission has encouraged Croatia to work diligently in order to meet these difficult benchmarks , especially in the area of judiciary reform that Mr Crowley referred to , as well as in the other area I mentioned , the shipbuilding sector .
<en> Concerning judiciary reform , we are providing legal and technical assistance for Croatia under the institution-building part of the instrument for pre-accession .
<en> We are encouraging twinning exercises and of course we provide our own expertise for Croatia .
<en> Member States are also providing their peer reviews which are important in order to benchmark whether or not Croatia is making good progress in this field .
<en> So all in all , we are doing well overall in the negotiations .
<en> The pace of the negotiations essentially depends on the pace of these critical reforms in order for Croatia to meet first the opening and then closing benchmarks .
<en> Subject : Progress of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) towards accession to the European Union
<en> At a press conference held at the NATO Summit in Brussels on 5 March 2008 , the Commissioner responsible for enlargement , Mr Rehn , stated that the failure of Greece and FYROM to reach an agreement on the name of the latter would adversely affect FYROM 's accession to the European Union .
<en> The EU wishes to encourage the continuation of negotiations under the auspices of the UN in order to find a mutually acceptable solution in the near future to the question of that country 's name .
<en> What measures will the Commission , therefore , take to facilitate the resumption of negotiations and find a mutually acceptable solution ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) I just want to make use of having the floor to stress the importance of this resolution .
<en> Yesterday there was no debate on it , or rather on the oral question .
<en> My committee has already received the Commissioner 's response and I therefore welcome the fact that this issue has remained on the agenda and will be put to the vote .
<sp>
<en> I simply pointed out that this debate was on yesterday 's agenda but since nobody asked to speak , there was no debate .
<en> That it why it is important to give the floor to the chairman of the committee concerned .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I wanted to say that yes , there were speakers , and that we were present in the Plenary .
<en> It was Mr Ouzký who was not present , and the Table and the President decided to annul it .
<en> The speakers were ready and a Comission representative was also present .
<sp>
<en> You are quite right to point that out .
<en> Speakers were present but the committee concerned had withdrawn this item .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission triggered the radioactive risk alert system yesterday following an incident at Krsko in Slovenia , the details of which remain sketchy .
<en> The alert was made public via a procedure that has been described as unusual , but its causes and its consequences are still totally confused and unclear .
<en> We therefore call on the Slovenian Presidency-in-Office and the Commission to maintain the level of transparency urged by the Commission , and to tell the European Parliament and the public what really happened and what is happening now , because a number of rumours are currently circulating which are neither clear nor wholly unambiguous .
<en> We therefore demand the necessary clarification from the European authorities .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like very briefly to endorse my colleague 's request .
<en> We have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past .
<en> Maximum transparency is required , not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter .
<en> As far as my country is concerned , we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia , which moreover currently holds the presidency .
<sp>
<en> We have heard from two speakers on this item and I think that is sufficient .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , on 1 June , on the basis of information received through the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange ( ECURIE ) system and guided by the principle of precaution , the Commission released a public statement about the alert message from Slovenia at 17.38 local time .
<en> This concerned the loss of coolant that occurred in the primary cooling system of the Krško nuclear power plant in south-west Slovenia .
<en> According to the last information received from the Slovenian authorities , the reactor of the nuclear power plant of Krško was completely shut down on Wednesday , 4 June at 19.30 .
<en> The relatively small leakage remained within the containment building .
<en> The Slovenian authorities have confirmed that there has been no discharge to the environment .
<en> The situation can be considered fully under control .
<en> The Commission immediately transmitted this information to all Member States according to the procedure and released a second public statement .
<en> The information about the incident came from the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange system .
<en> The ECURIE system requires that Member States promptly notify the Commission and all the Member States potentially affected when they intend to take counter measures if necessary , in order to protect the population against the effects of a radiological or nuclear accident .
<en> The European Community needs to immediately forward this notification to all Member States .
<en> All the 27 Member States , as well as Switzerland , have signed the ECURIE agreement .
<en> The Commission emphasises that the ECURIE system is an information-sharing system about nuclear incidents , and the Commission considers that a full transparency approach is the most appropriate response in cases of nuclear incidents .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I recently obtained radiation measurement data from a radioactivity measuring station in Krško which show that in fact , an astonishing peak in radiation levels was recorded the day before the alarm was sounded .
<en> There has to be an explanation for that .
<sp>
<en> With that , we close that particular item .
<en> The Commission will take note .
<en> We will now proceed with our normal business .
<en> ( The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The European Commission is proposing to make 2010 the ' European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion ' .
<2en> With the largest ever budget for a European year , the political connotations of the project are all too clear .
<2en> This year of ' combat ' will serve merely to boost the image of a European Union which is witnessing the complete failure of its Lisbon Strategy .
<2en> Although the fight against poverty and social exclusion is a priority and must be supported , despite all of these pious hopes , Europe will have done nothing to improve the lives of the 78 million Europeans living below the poverty threshold .
<2en> This is why I will be voting against this report , the sole acknowledged political aim of which is to pander to the propaganda of the euro-globalists .
<2en> Following the Irish ' no ' vote , it is time for the arrogance of the ultra-Europeans to be replaced by an objective review of current European integration .
<2en> This absurd system urgently needs to be reformed if we are to maintain a Europe of cooperation and not one of submission .
<2en> A Europe of nations must finally emerge that fosters Community protection and preference for Europeans .
<sp>
<2en> Growing concerns over unemployment and the rising prices of essential goods and fuel throughout the continent are a serious reason for confronting the problem of poverty and social exclusion , which affects around 16 % of the population .
<2en> I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , who is the President of the Intergroup on Family and Protection of Childhood , of which I am Vice-President , on her work .
<2en> I share her concern for those who are most exposed to this scourge and who are experiencing the greatest difficulty in overcoming it .
<2en> I should like to second her recommendation that the difficult circumstances of outermost regions , island regions and areas in industrial decline must always be taken into account .
<2en> The European Commission 's proposal gives us hope of more collective , public and private , individual and Community awareness of this phenomenon and a commitment by the Union and the Member States to seek solutions whose cornerstone has to be the intrinsic and inalienable dignity of every human being .
<2en> The Lisbon Strategy sought to affirm European global competitiveness by ensuring social cohesion and investing in employment .
<2en> Despite its lack of success , I hope that 2010 will help awaken Europeans ' awareness of the need for greater social cohesion .
<2en> I voted in favour of the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - 2010 will be the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
<en> I hope that the subject of child poverty across the EU will be highlighted and concrete action taken by Member States to eradicate child poverty .
<sp>
<2en> Do we all appreciate the importance of the problem of poverty and social exclusion ?
<2en> Are we aware that in 2006 16 % of the citizens of the EU-25 ( 78 million people ) were living below the poverty threshold ?
<2en> I am in favour of 2010 being proclaimed European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
<2en> It is our moral duty to increase social awareness of this matter .
<2en> The European Year should make people aware of the existence of poverty and social exclusion in Europe and convey the message that they have a destructive impact on social and economic development .
<2en> It should endorse the significance of collective responsibility , embracing not only decision-makers , but also participants in the public and private sectors .
<2en> Our task is to achieve stable economic growth by 2010 , with a greater number of better jobs and greater social cohesion .
<2en> I am voting in favour of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou 's report .
<sp>
<2en> The European Parliament decided to support the position of the Commission and the Council on Slovakia 's wish to adopt the single currency on 1 January 2009 , although it does have some concerns about discrepancies between the convergence reports of the Commission and the ECB as regards the sustainability of inflation .
<2en> It is also interesting that the report expresses concern about what it considers to be ' low support for the euro among Slovak citizens ' .
<2en> Furthermore , instead of trying to address the reasons for this low support , it calls on the authorities of Slovakia to step up the public information campaign aimed at explaining ' the benefits of the single currency ' , whilst nevertheless still exhorting them to take all necessary steps in order to minimise price increases during the changeover period .
<2en> Once again , it is a shame that we cannot know exactly what the majority of Slovak citizens think about all that is happening , particularly their joining the euro .
<2en> Hence our abstention .
<2en> The consequences in Portugal are well known and prompt us to oppose this in a clear-cut fashion .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Galeote Quecedo on a proposal for a Council regulation opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fisheries products into the Canary Islands .
<en> The report advocates lifting the common customs tariff on the import of certain fisheries products to the Canary Islands for the years 2007-2013 .
<en> It should be noted that the provisions affected by the proposal expired on 31 December 2006 .
<en> The proposal concerning the establishment of tariff-free quotas and the provisions for managing the latter complies with Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty on European Union , which provides for specific measures to assist the outermost regions .
<en> I therefore voted in favour of this report , as I consider that the exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of certain fishery products , which are essential for domestic consumption , entails additional costs for this sector .
<en> One way of remedying natural difficulties of this type , due to geographical location , is to temporarily suspend duties on imports of the products in question from third countries .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) I voted in favour of the Jäätteenmäki report on the statute of the European Ombudsman .
<en> As a member of the European Parliament 's Committee on Petitions , I have seen for myself that an enormous , and growing , number of citizens are turning to the Community institutions to appeal against the failure of Member States to comply with EU rules .
<en> Very often the petitions submitted to Parliament , and examined by the committee responsible , cannot be deemed admissible .
<en> Here I would take up one key point : the office of the European Ombudsman must work harder and better on its external communications with citizens .
<en> Very often the ordinary person is unaware even of the existence of the Ombudsman , potentially a means of creating a more functional and efficient link with the EU institutions .
<en> The statute on which we are voting today sets out new mechanisms to bolster the effectiveness of the Ombudsman 's work .
<en> It will be up to us MEPs to monitor the outcomes .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I support the own-initiative report by Mrs Jäätteenmäki on the European Ombudsman 's access to information , and the need for a clearer set of regulations , as it seeks to lay down more precise rules in this area .
<en> According to the text the various bodies and institutions of the European Union must supply the Ombudsman with all the information asked for , whereas until now a document could be refused on the pretext of confidentiality .
<en> Similarly , the obligation on officials to provide testimony ' pursuant to instructions from their administrations ' is to be removed , while the official in question is to be required to tell the truth in all honesty .
<en> Mrs Jäätteenmäki 's proposals are aimed at strengthening the public 's confidence in the activities of the European Ombudsman and as such they are worthy of implementation .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) Mr President , if you went into the corridors of Parliament yesterday you would have seen a great many stickers from the lobbyists ' organisation of the European chemical industry on the floor , and some of them are still there today .
<en> I wonder whether the quaestors , when they gave permission for the exhibition , authorised the organisation to spread stickers everywhere on our floors .
<en> If that is the case , I think it was an incorrect decision .
<en> If the quaestors did not give any such permission , I think that Cefic has clearly breached its undertakings as a lobbyist and should therefore have its access pass withdrawn or at least receive a harsh reprimand .
<en> I hope you can look into what actually happened and ensure that all these stickers are removed immediately .
<sp>
<en> Fine , we shall look into the matter , Mr Schlyter .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FI ) I strongly support the environmental impact assessment for the Nord Stream gas pipeline proposed in the Committee 's report .
<en> However , it is not only about this : its aspects relating to energy policy must not be forgotten either .
<en> We cannot pursue an energy policy that is separate from climate policy .
<en> They fundamentally belong together , like taxation and the budget or law and justice .
<en> There can no longer be an energy policy without financial or other such instruments that make its components possible .
<en> The White Papers that discuss the energy matters of the Union and its Member States have repeatedly demanded clean , independent and competitive forms of energy - but there is only a functioning market mechanism for the last criterion , competitiveness .
<en> I still do not see any market mechanisms that would reduce our dependence on energy - and especially not on gas from Russia .
<en> This week , the European Energy Forum will hold discussions with OPEC .
<en> It is not a weakness for OPEC that it is an indispensable cartel that has too great an influence on our economy .
<en> The dependence on energy resulting from the mistakes of previous generations has been allowed to grow and flourish at our expense .
<en> It is a factor that we should remember when we make decisions on future solutions , even in the case of gas pipelines and other economic dependence .
<en> Is it sustainable development , and is it the right direction , when we are striving for a low-carbon economy ?
<en> Climate change is a reality , and energy costs are also rising .
<en> Dependence on gas is increasing and is giving the EU 's neighbour the power it lost 20 years ago .
<en> We certainly do not want to repeat the mistakes of our political predecessors .
<en> We have a lot to do in a short time .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I completely agree with the view of the rapporteur , Mr Marcin Libicki , that the realisation of the project commonly known as the ' Baltic Pipeline ' could pose an ecological risk to eight European Union countries : Germany , Sweden , Finland , Latvia , Lithuania , Estonia , Denmark and Poland .
<en> It could also have a negative effect on consumers through increased prices to cover the cost of the pipeline 's construction .
<en> It is an important point that , as an alternative , the North European Pipeline could be built overland through European Union countries .
<en> This would fulfil all the strategic and economic requirements contained in Decision 1364 / 2006 / EC .
<en> The alternative proposal is safer from the point of view of the environment and it is also cheaper .
<en> I am particularly in favour of carrying out independent reports and researching the impact of the pipeline construction on the environment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - A project on the scale of the Nordstream gas pipeline requires full and thorough examination of the environmental implications involved .
<en> Before the project can start , we must make sure that the project meets stringent environmental criteria .
<en> These views are reflected in my vote on Marcin Libicki 's report on the environmental impact of the planned gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea to link up Russia and Germany .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Today we shall be voting on a very important report on the impact of the planned construction of the so-called Baltic Pipeline linking Russia and Germany on the natural environment of the Baltic Sea .
<en> The planned project is one of many gas infrastructure projects that are necessary to satisfy growing EU requirements for gas .
<en> However , special attention should be given to a number of factors relating to its construction .
<en> This , the longest and shallowest gas mains pipeline in the world , poses a serious threat to biodiversity and natural habitats , as well as to the safety and movement of shipping in this region , not to mention the approximately 80 000 MT of ammunition sunk here during the Second World War .
<en> As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and also a rapporteur on the Espoo Convention , I would like to underline that every investment of this type , which has an international dimension , should be the result of prior and thorough consultation with all interested parties .
<en> We should pay attention to assessments of any alternative solutions , such as land routes , which should take into account construction costs as well as ecological safety .
<en> With the growing dependence of the EU on a small number of energy sources and their suppliers , it is important to support initiatives aimed at diversification ; we should stop to think whether the Russian company Gazprom , which holds 51 % of the shares in the Nord Stream consortium , is the best solution in this context ?
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome the fact that the Committee on Petitions took this initiative to bring this report on the environmental impact of the planned gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea to a vote .
<en> MEPs need to inform themselves of the consequences of this proposal .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I supported the adoption of the general provisions regarding the establishment of a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument .
<en> I think this instrument should evolve and the European Union 's financial and budgetary priorities should move towards the Eastern dimension of the Neighbourhood Policy , which should include the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine as well .
<en> I supported the adoption of the report in order to speak more about a solution regarding the European vocation and the EU integration of the Republic of Moldova , obviously correlated with democratic progresses in the fields of freedom of mass media , justice reforms , guaranteeing the fundamental rights of citizens and ensuring the rights of opposition parties in the electoral competition of 2009 .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I refer to my position regarding the establishment of common criteria that are clear regarding grant schemes made directly under CAP .
<en> Also I would like to refer to the establishment of aid and rights and duties of farmers and herdsmen .
<en> The proposal which is being made is to crystallise criteria so that Member States will be authorised to pass on aid to herdsmen producing beef and veal .
<en> This system is technically referred to as ' coupled ' and as Malta has opted for the implementation of fully decoupled payments I voted in favour on the basis of an issue which is in the national interest .
<sp>
<2en> People are feeling insecure about food because of BSE , meat scandals and the rest , where the EU has not always left a very good impression .
<2en> If the Bavarian authorities were really kept in the dark for years about a police bust involving Italian criminals dealing in rotten cheese , and if there was a breakdown in cooperation over the recent wine scandal , this all highlights the serious weaknesses in the European reporting system , which have to be put right immediately .
<2en> The current crisis in the food sector also clearly shows how important agricultural self-sufficiency is for any country .
<2en> We should therefore be providing greater support for our own small farmers and more especially for our organic farmers too .
<2en> The need to boost agricultural output should certainly not be used as a pretext for a general EU-wide endorsement of GM technology by the back door .
<2en> If the public rejects genetically modified foodstuffs then the EU must abide by this decision and not yield to the interests of a few major corporations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Malta 's historical industry is ship repair .
<en> Working in the dockyards is dangerous .
<en> Together with the construction industry , they are two main areas prone to accidents .
<en> Whereas the construction industry has been slow on the uptake relating to the use of safety work equipment , the dockyards pay great attention to safety and security at work .
<en> Today Malta 's dockyards are facing their greatest test .
<en> The Nationalist Government wants to privatise them at all costs .
<en> It appears that no other alternatives are to be considered .
<en> Diversification , niche industries or specialisation such as refurbishing cruise liners don 't appear to be on the agenda for discussion .
<en> This notwithstanding , that the Government has been told both by the Malta Labour Party and the General Workers Union that they are prepared to play their part to save the yards .
<en> These dockyards have been continuously providing not only for themselves , but also for Maltese industry , highly trained tradesmen .
<en> Their excellence is second to none .
<en> I have personally assessed their excellence when towards the tail-end of the last Labour Government the Prime Minister gave me responsibility for the yards .
<en> I may also add that I have a personal soft spot for the yards as my father was a dockyard employee in the 1950 's .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) On the basis of the report by my Polish colleague Dariusz Rosati , I voted in favour of the legislative resolution that amends , in accordance with the consultation procedure , the proposal for a Council directive amending various provisions of Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax .
<en> Pursuant to Article 171 of the EC Treaty , the Community may set up joint undertakings or any other structure necessary for the efficient execution of Community research , technological development and demonstration programmes and will be very likely do so increasingly in the future .
<en> It was therefore logical to define a suitable tax framework for these types of undertakings by treating them like international bodies .
<en> Moreover , in the context of their accession Bulgaria and Romania , like other new Member States , have been authorised to apply derogations regarding the tax exemption granted to small and medium-sized enterprises and the VAT scheme applicable to the international transport of passengers .
<en> For the purposes of transparency and consistency , these exemptions should be incorporated into the VAT Directive .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , I will do my best not to repeat some of the comments already made .
<en> I must , however , point out that the first time I heard of sovereign wealth funds was the 1993 ' KIO scandal ' in Spain , which , according to the Kuwaiti authorities of the time , caused more economic damage than Saddam Hussein 's invasion in 1991 .
<en> Other names have emerged since then .
<en> We have already talked about Gazprom , Chinese activity in Africa and Venezuela 's use of the funds to export the Bolivarian revolution , and we will be talking more today as a result of the financial crisis .
<en> Many companies are being bought up or receiving financial assistance through these funds .
<en> As Mrs Kauppi said on behalf of my group , it is true that the funds have some unquestionable advantages : they help improve allocation of resources , they inject liquidity and reduce volatility , and these are all very useful at this particular juncture .
<en> Some of the concerns aroused by the funds have also been mentioned : more extensive government intervention in economies , intervention that may occasionally be dictated by political rather than economic objectives - which can lead to market distortions and threats to national security - and the national reaction of each government , which could further fragment the internal market .
<en> To paraphrase Lenin , what is to be done ?
<en> Obviously we must continue to investigate how these funds operate and produce an accurate diagnosis of their workings , and the Community framework must be reviewed .
<en> It is true that they are subject to rules on competence and investor protection , but is this sufficient ?
<en> We must also come up with a voluntary code of conduct to guarantee transparency , predictability and accountability .
<en> Finally , the code of conduct ought to be exported to the international framework .
<en> I thus extend a hearty welcome to transatlantic cooperation and cooperation with bodies such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund .
<en> Action must be taken , and it must be taken soon .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I share the concerns expressed here by many speakers about state-owned funds , but I would like to stress as well that private commercial funds , such as hedge funds and private equity , are of even more concern .
<en> This is because they often do not have a long-term-oriented focus , whereas sovereign wealth funds , together with pension funds , often have this long-term orientation and can strengthen the role of minority shareholders , as well as having a positive role in providing the market with liquidity .
<en> The point is that they are often not transparent enough in their investment strategy and intentions , and I hope that the Commission will focus on this .
<en> The Committee on Legal Affairs recently adopted a report in this Parliament on the transparency of institutional investors , and there we asked the Commission to come up with a directive guaranteeing common standards of transparency .
<en> I hope the Commission can react to this request .
<en> My last point is about the code of conduct and the ' comply-or-explain ' procedure .
<en> Is this also an element which the Commission has considered ?
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , sovereign wealth funds have come into the spotlight , especially since last year when China declared its intention to invest USD 3 billion , only USD 3 billion , of its fund reserves in private holding companies .
<en> The capital held in sovereign wealth funds now totals well over USD 3 trillion , which is twice as much as that held in hedge funds : reason enough for us now to look into this whole business .
<en> So far we only know of a transparent Norwegian system that operates good governance .
<en> However , just like private venture capital , sovereign wealth funds can cover up exactly who the entrepreneur is .
<en> Sovereign wealth funds can invest strategically and can grow rapidly .
<en> Transparency is therefore urgently required .
<en> Employee rights can be restricted and employment conditions altered as a result of corporate transfers that have been influenced by sovereign wealth funds .
<en> Transparency and due notification is therefore needed in this area .
<en> Another point worthy of mention is that the IMF , the US Treasury Department and the German Chancellor are calling for increased controls and regulation .
<en> It certainly seems that we need to do something .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would caution my colleagues against demonising sovereign wealth funds , let alone , Mrs van den Burg , private equity investors .
<en> Recycling surpluses is highly desirable , whether by spending or investment .
<en> The 1930s Depression was the result of hoarding by surplus countries .
<en> Much better that these surpluses are recycled as investments to where they are needed - to our banks with their capital shortfalls , to our infrastructure needing modernisation , our real estate in its current difficulties and our business and industries in general to create and preserve jobs .
<en> Yes , we need reciprocity , but the EU is the biggest investor internationally anyway .
<en> This must not be an excuse for protectionism to keep out other investors .
<en> Surely we have our competition policy to deal with cartels and monopolies .
<en> We have our labour and health and safety rules to protect our workers , and , as a last resort , we have our sovereign right to legislate against unacceptable political interference .
<en> Do not look gift horses in the mouth !
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Just a few things in brief .
<en> We are heterogeneous - for example , I come from the new Member States , and am the first person from there to speak today - poor in capital , with a defenceless public sector and a very unhappy past , which threatens us with its return in an imperialistic manner .
<en> And everybody must take this seriously .
<en> The second thing , which has been discussed here , is that these sovereign state funds very often serve imperialistic goals , and not only in medium-term investments but also in the world 's energy sources ; look at China 's shopping in Africa .
<en> It is therefore not certain that this international agreement or code of conduct alone will be enough .
<en> After the relevant analysis , we must think long and hard about whether some Member States are taking national security measures on a uniform basis that would prevent foreign bandit investments in strategic sectors , and that this would not act against the free flow of capital but would still mean some security .
<en> Thank you .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Our officials will follow the case .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Russia is one of our main political and economic partners .
<en> In recent days , however , Russia has made intimidating statements against the Union , threatening it with the Russian economic and military might .
<en> Countries involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy have received similar threats .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , in the context of a partnership , is it normal practice for one of the partners to resort to such action ?
<en> I have in mind , in particular , our shared interests , namely the construction of oil and gas pipelines .
<en> The European Community is home to 500 million citizens and is the largest economy in the world .
<en> The fact that a country with significantly less potential can ride roughshod over the Union indicates that we are being treated as a weak partner incapable of taking serious political decisions .
<en> It is just as well that the Lisbon Treaty is not in force because if it were , even individual Member States of the Union would be denied the opportunity to give an honourable response .
<sp>
<en> Thank you .
<en> The Lisbon Treaty is explicit : I would ask you to bear with me as I have just made the same point in my speech to the European Council .
<en> Solidarity between the Member States in the energy sphere is a principle laid down in the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> This means that should one EU Member State be faced with a threat to cut off its energy supplies , all the other Member States would have a duty to support it .
<en> For this reason , it is particularly important that the Lisbon Treaty be ratified .
<en> I apologise for reiterating the point , but the Treaty is very important for the energy sphere in particular .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I should like to take this time to point out the effect that the implementation of the Energy-using Products Directive will have on a company in my constituency that has expertise in this heating field .
<en> They inform me that the current proposal for implementation in relation to boilers will have a severe and unnecessary impact on Ireland 's central heating industry , which employs many people in my constituency .
<en> Current proposals for boilers will require manufacturers to apply an energy-rating label to the boiler , as well as heating controls , pumps and some renewables .
<en> These labelling proposals overlook the key role of the professional installer .
<en> Installers are a vital part of the heating supply chain , and the Commission 's approach will mean their expertise will be largely ignored or wasted .
<en> The Commission 's proposals will fundamentally change the entire Irish domestic heating market , with wider implications in terms of restricted choice , misleading information for consumers , higher costs and a less flexible and competitive market , as well as loss of employment .
<en> Ahead of the Commission 's Consultation Forum , I should like the Commission to listen to the experts when considering the effects of this directive on Ireland .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I too want to add my thanks for the formal statement made by the Chamber on the grave accident that occurred on 20 August at Barajas Airport and which led to 155 deaths .
<en> However , I also think it is perhaps time , ladies and gentlemen , for us to question whether all the airlines are strictly applying all the European directives on safety and maintenance .
<en> I think the time has come , and I make this request from this House , for the European Commission to critically review the level of compliance in terms of aviation safety , particularly in the area of aircraft maintenance .
<en> I therefore believe that this is the time , not only for sorrow , of course , and solidarity , of course , but also to critically review the level of compliance with the European directives on aviation safety and maintenance of European aircraft .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome the Hammerstein report on the Petitions committee today .
<en> In particular , I welcome the report 's taking to task of the Irish government on many issues .
<en> The Irish government 's decision to push ahead with the M3 motorway through the heart of one of our most historic national sites is unjustifiable .
<en> The project should be abandoned or re-worked to protect our national monuments .
<en> The campaign must continue in Ireland and Europe to make sure that this happens before it is too late as the government is trying to ensure .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of the Hammerstein report on the work of the Committee on Petitions .
<2en> It supports the work of that committee , which is one of the primary channels of communication between citizens and the European institutions .
<2en> The effectiveness of the Committee on Petitions in negotiating and supporting citizens ' causes needs to be improved by strengthening its institutional role and further improving its cooperation with the European Commission , the European Ombudsman and the authorities of the Member States .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The failure of Parliament to support Amendment 1 on the issue of the one seat is disappointing .
<en> This is the second Strasbourg part-session which we have had in Brussels , and we have proved that we can meet effectively and vote in Brussels .
<en> We no longer need to hold sessions in Strasbourg .
<en> I encourage colleagues to sign Written Declaration 75 calling on Parliament to meet in Brussels and end Strasbourg sessions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the report , since we are opposed to the introduction of special support for hill and mountain farmers in the form of a dairy cow premium .
<en> Although we welcome a comprehensive strategy for hill and mountain regions , increased support to the dairy sector is not the right way to go .
<en> If the aim is to reduce the share of the common agricultural policy in the EU budget as a whole , transfers from the first to the second pillar are also not appropriate .
<sp>
<2en> The report on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming identifies , if only in a piecemeal way , the specific problems faced by farming and stock-rearing in those regions .
<2en> Among other things , these are inaccessibility , high transport costs and difficult soil conditions for crops etc .
<2en> However , the report does not mention the responsibility of Member States and the EU for the lack of infrastructure , and for the substantial absence of specific measures .
<2en> Such measures should be aimed at minimising the natural disadvantages of these regions in producing and marketing agricultural products , and at making good use of comparative benefits .
<2en> The EU uses vague wording and empty expressions of good intent .
<2en> Whatever measures are taken turn out to be ineffective and fail to halt the depopulation of these regions .
<2en> The same unproductive stance is maintained in the report , which tries to whitewash Community policy .
<2en> It contains no mention of the steady reduction in EU agricultural funding , the fiscal budgets and the negative impact of the CAP .
<2en> On the contrary , the EU is merely repeating the same old measures , which it is trying to adapt to the framework of the forthcoming CAP health check .
<2en> An essential pre-condition for improving living conditions , and increasing agricultural income in hill and mountain regions , is the struggle of the farmers themselves against the CAP , and the demand for special funding for hill and mountain regions in a bid to improve infrastructure and support the agricultural production process .

<en> in writing . - ( GA ) A short while ago there was a sailing boat accident 30 kilometres off the coast of France .
<en> The crew and the people aboard the Erika were very lucky and escaped without injury .
<en> They did not , however , have to rely on luck alone .
<en> It was with the help of a French rescue team that they survived .
<en> The Irish and French maritime investigation units worked closely together when investigating the cause of the disaster .
<en> The case of the Erika highlights what can happen when crews hesitate in seeking out help .
<en> As the author of the reports has stated , the lives of those on board a boat and the welfare of the environment , should never be put at risk by not contacting the nearest harbour or rescue team when an accident occurs .
<en> In terms of maritime safety , cooperation is urgently needed internationally .
<en> Therefore , I am hopeful that a solution can be reached on the Second Reading of the Maritime Package and as result I am happy to give my support to those reports .

<en> in writing . - ( LT ) The main purpose of all legislation on medicinal products has to be to protect our society 's health .
<en> However , this aim should be achieved by measures that do not interfere with the development of industry in the European Union or the trade in medicinal products .
<en> Despite the fact that earlier regulations have drawn up a list of food colourants , different countries have different laws on their use .
<en> These differences can hinder the trade in medicines containing these colourants , and that is why the regulation must be amended ; this would bring more clarity and make the work of quite a few institutions easier .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) This proposal seeks to amend the regulatory framework for electronic communications in order to improve its effectiveness , ensure simpler and more efficient access to frequencies available in the radio spectrum and reduce the administrative costs needed to implement the regulations .
<en> As a result , wherever they are in the EU , European citizens should benefit from more efficient and cheaper communication services , whether they are using mobile phones , broadband connections to the Internet or cable television .
<en> The new system for the radio spectrum is intended to promote investment in new infrastructures and allow all citizens to have broadband access .
<en> An internal communications market that is operating correctly and a competitive information society economy , benefiting consumers and businesses , can only exist if the regulatory framework for telecommunications is coherently applied .
<en> To this end , the Commission 's coordination role should be reinforced , acting in strict cooperation with the NRAs ( National Regulatory Authorities ) and the new Body of European Regulators in Telecom ( BERT ) , in order to improve the coherence of both national decisions with an impact on the internal market and the imposition of remedies .
<en> I therefore support this report and the main amendments which seek to extend the offer to consumers by reinforcing competition .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of Catherine Trautmann 's report on electronic communications networks and services because , in my opinion , the legislative framework for electronic communications must be improved in order to offer the consumer more choice , better protection , a cheaper service and improved quality .
<en> Together with the creation of a new Body of European Regulators in Telecom , this new legislative framework will ensure better protection of consumers ' private data , increase competition , offer consumers more choice and make contractual terms clearer .
<en> It should also be highlighted that the ' package ' will facilitate access for people with disabilities to telecommunications services .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Like other natural resources , spectrum is a public good .
<en> It is therefore an area which should remain within public management to ensure that it serves the public interest .
<en> This is the only way to offer public goods which are essential to developing an information society for all .
<en> That is why we fundamentally disagree with the resolution adopted and voted against it .
<en> Experience has shown that combined approaches ( policies and market ) always end up serving the interests of economic groups rather than the interests of the people .
<en> The same applies to the allocation of spectrum released by the digital switchover , where the priority should be social , cultural and economic value ( better public service , wireless broadband to underserved areas , growth and jobs , and so on ) and not increasing public revenues .
<en> Spectrum management is the exclusive competence of each Member State .
<en> However , there are certain aspects of the resolution with which we do agree , bearing in mind that spectrum knows no borders and that effective use of spectrum in the Member States and EU-level coordination are useful , particularly for the development of pan-European services and the negotiation of international agreements .
<en> However , we disagree with the idea of using an approach identical to commercial policy .

<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I will try to be very clear , given the wide variety of opinions expressed from my bench .
<en> Firstly , the current crisis is not a biblical curse or a punishment from the gods .
<en> The markets have failed and these failures have prompted interventions which would have delighted Keynes himself .
<en> If the markets have failed , then we must correct what has failed in the markets ; in other words , we must do something .
<en> This something involves various things .
<en> Firstly , we must administer a shock treatment to bring the patient out of his current coma .
<en> I would remind the Commission and the Council that , while the liquidity problems can be solved by the European Central Bank , the solvency problems are something which directly affects you : the Council , the Commission and the Member States .
<en> Secondly , to stop this happening again , we need to know what has failed in the markets and what principles we should re-establish .
<en> There has been a failure in the management of risk , in governance and , finally , in ethics .
<en> This means that we must re-establish some basic principles : transparency in products , in companies and in markets ; responsibility of managers ; confidence between the financial economy and the real economy , and the central role of politics .
<en> I agree with the Council that the times of total deregulation are over .
<en> Neither the markets nor industry can self-regulate .
<en> The final prescription - which is needed to vaccinate the patient and ensure that this does not happen again or in any other way - is that we must continue with market integration .
<en> We have to achieve a sufficiently critical dimension , as they have done in the United States .
<en> We have to establish a democracy of the euro so that our currency can have some influence in the world in a crisis that is global .
<en> Finally , we have to review the regulatory framework and the supervisory framework which are what have failed .
<en> I therefore do not agree with soft legislation , with codes of conduct or with self-regulation .
<en> It is up to us all to offer a response to our people who are , after all , the ones who will ultimately pay the price .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) In one minute , what conclusions can I draw on the current crisis ?
<en> It is the result of choosing not to adequately supervise the activities of the financial markets .
<en> Competent regulation does not kill markets but , on the contrary , is essential for their survival .
<en> There are people who are responsible for the losses , but there are now also citizens who are paying the price for their excesses and for the failures in public supervision .
<en> Warnings were given some time ago .
<en> The Rasmussen report , which this Parliament adopted yesterday by a very large majority , makes specific proposals on the risks of excessive leverage , lack of transparency and conflicts of interest , but this report stems from work begun by the Socialist Group years before the crisis began in 2007 .
<en> The own-initiative report by Ieke van den Burg and Daniel Dăianu takes the same line .
<en> The European Union is a major partner in the international context and I congratulate Commissioner Almunia on his announcements today ; but will Commissioner McCreevy agree with these ?
<en> The paralysis affecting the Commission in relation to these matters has no possible justification .
<en> Parliament is doing what it should .
<en> The other institutions should also act accordingly .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , it is a pity that Mr Schulz has already left .
<en> I wanted to make the point that it is too early to say who will go bankrupt , because nobody knows who the end-investors in the toxic assets are .
<en> Maybe they are state-owned banks .
<en> Nevertheless , I would like to encourage a broader view of events and to recall that Parliament , as early as the beginning of this year , put forward some valid proposals which were not accepted by the Council and the Commission .
<en> Firstly , we asked for economic management at EU level to be brought into line with global developments and for the broad economic guidelines to be updated .
<en> We also suggested ensuring vigorous enforcement of EU competition rules and not allowing the crowding-out of small and medium-sized business from the market , or the creation of monsters which are too big to fall .
<en> We have to promote and preserve our national , traditional business culture because the slogan of the European Union is ' in diversity we are united ' .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , let us hope that the American proposals for purchases of toxic assets do work , because , if they do not , the contagion will almost certainly spread over here .
<en> I would like assurance from Mr Jouyet and Mr Almunia that we really do have our defences in place .
<en> Do we have our lenders of last resort ready to meet the very worst which might occur in such a circumstance ?
<en> We are moving from a liquidity problem to a solvency problem .
<en> It is true that , in due course , we will have to review our regulatory defences , but this cannot and should not be done precipitately , in the heat of the crisis .
<en> We would risk overreacting , imposing unnecessary , wrongly directed , over-draconian conditions which would only harm the prospects for investment in our economies and jobs for the future .
<en> The most vital thing , which we must bring about immediately , is the restoration of confidence .
<en> Mr Almunia , you mentioned the word several times .
<en> Let us see how we can set about it .
<en> I would urge that the leaders of the world 's most important economies of America , Europe , the Middle and Far East meet together within days and assure the world unequivocally that whatever is necessary to douse the flames will be provided unequivocally wherever those flames may erupt .
<en> Only when the flames and embers are extinguished can we turn to post-mortems as to how this happened and what is needed to avoid it happening again .
<en> Confidence is the vital base on which a vibrant financial system and a vibrant global economy rests .
<en> It is now up to the political leaders of the highest level - a summit indeed - of the free-market economies to come together - no excuses , no holding back , no arguments - to take full responsibility for restoring confidence .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called the past few weeks a ' humbling ' time for the United States as he unveiled his rescue package of up to 700 billion dollars for the country 's crippled financial sector .
<en> The situation in the US is indeed alarming .
<en> The US financial system with its investment banks , hedge funds and structured products , which are not subject to normal banking supervision , and its numerous business operations conducted through single-purpose companies which do not appear in any balance sheet , has virtually collapsed .
<en> It is unlikely to be resurrected very quickly in its original form .
<en> The last two pure investment banks - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - have now switched to the commercial banking sector .
<en> The promise of cheap money for everyone to fuel ever more growth , profits and liquidity has been revealed as an illusion : this type of perpetual motion simply does not exist .
<en> A debt-fuelled high standard of living for everyone with a car , house and everything else early on in life simply cannot be maintained over the long term .
<en> The real economy has caught up with us : without employment , there can be no savings , without savings , there is no investment , and without investment , there is no sustainable growth .
<en> We Europeans should learn from the US disaster .
<en> There is no alternative to budget consolidation .
<en> Money does not grow on trees .
<en> A plentiful supply of cheap money , which is what the Socialists are always demanding from the ECB , will not solve the problem ; it will simply make it worse .
<en> The Commission should implement the proposals which have the European Parliament 's support as regards securitisation , maintenance of structured products on the initiators ' books , more supervision , a code of conduct for market participants and various other measures as swiftly as possible , albeit with a sense of proportion and diligence .

<en> The next item is Question Time ( B6-0462 / 2008 ) .
<en> The following questions are addressed to the Commission .
<en> Part one
<en> Subject : Eurozone budget deficit limits
<en> Under the rules of the European Union 's Stability and Growth Pact , eurozone countries should remain inside a budget deficit limit of 3 % of GDP .
<en> Can the Commission provide an up-to-date assessment of current adherence to the rules ?
<en> Does the Commission consider current fiscal rules to be flexible enough to allow governments to react to economic trouble but strict enough to ensure the sustainability of public finances ?
<en> What , if any , are the circumstances in which eurozone countries may be permitted to exceed the 3 % budget deficit ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - The subject of the first question is covered in detail in the Commission 's 2008 report on public finances in the EMU .
<en> The only significant budgetary development which is not covered there is the recent launch of the excessive-deficit procedure for the United Kingdom .
<en> Given that the budget deficit in the UK is expected by the Commission to exceed the 3 % reference value in both fiscal years 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 , in accordance with Article 104 ( 6 ) of the Treaty , the Council has decided this year that an excessive deficit does exist in the United Kingdom .
<en> On the same occasion , in accordance with Article 104 ( 7 ) of the Treaty , the Council set a deadline of one year for the correction of this excessive deficit .
<en> More generally , in line with its mandate under the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact , the Commission is continuously monitoring the economic and budgetary development in Member States and stands ready to activate the instruments of budgetary surveillance where necessary .
<en> The answer to the second question is positive , particularly with reference to the corrective arm .
<en> Since the 2005 reform , excessive deficits have been corrected , with currently only the UK and Hungary subject to the excessive-deficit procedure .
<en> Overall , in 2007 the euro area recorded its lowest structural fiscal deficit since 1973 .
<en> Nevertheless , the application of the preventive arm has sometimes been uneven .
<en> So , in the April 2007 Berlin Declaration , the euro-area Finance Ministers committed themselves to reaching their medium-term budgetary objectives by 2010 at the latest .
<en> In principle this commitment was reiterated this year .
<en> At the same time , the 2005 reform introduced enough economic rationale into the pact to be able to react flexibly to serious disturbances where necessary , in particular through the revised flexibility clause and the incorporation of implicit liabilities in MTOs .
<en> The functioning of the revised pact is well documented in the Commission reports on public finances in the EMU of 2006 , 2007 and 2008 and in the accompanying communication .
<en> In this year 's report , the methodology proposed for incorporating implicit liabilities in the MTOs of the preventive arm is also presented .
<en> Regarding the third question , according to the reformed Stability and Growth Pact , only under tightly constrained circumstances are budget deficits in EU Member States permitted to exceed the 3 % reference value without resulting in the existence of excessive deficit .
<en> In particular , these deficits will always have to be close and also temporary .
<en> In addition , either the excess over the reference value must be exceptional , and / or it must include a deficit occurring under circumstances of severe economic downturn , which is defined as negative growth or accumulated loss of output .
<en> If the deficit is close and temporary , various other element factors always need to be taken into account , but this must happen in a very balanced way .
<en> Other relevant factors include , for instance , growth-enhancing expenditure on research and development .
<en> However , a direct deduction of any spending items from the deficit is excluded .
<en> Finally , in any event , an annual structural fiscal improvement of the order of 0.5 % of GDP as a benchmark must be delivered .
<sp>
<en> I will take time to digest the detail in your answer .
<en> You mentioned in particular the UK .
<en> I have an interest , obviously , in the Irish situation and we are expecting a tough budget in Ireland in a number of weeks .
<en> I would like you to comment if you will on the conversations you have had with the Irish Minister about our deficit and , indeed , whether we will exceed and what impact that will have from an EU perspective .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Well , we always follow facts .
<en> Any conversation between my colleague Joaquín Almunia and Irish colleagues is for more information , but we analyse the facts and figures at the end of the year .
<en> That is why , unfortunately , I cannot answer this question , but it is very understandable .
<en> As I said today , we have excessive-budget procedures against the UK and Hungary .
<sp>
<en> Does the Commission accept that under the Treaty - as opposed to the Stability Pact - the 3 % is not a limit , it is a reference value ?
<en> The Commission 's report on any Member State that exceeds that reference value has to take account - and I quote Article 104 ( 3 ) of the Treaty - ' of all other relevant factors including the medium-term economic and budgetary position of the Member States ' .
<en> Does he not think that in the last few days and weeks the economic positions of Member States have necessarily changed , and perhaps warrant an extra degree of flexibility ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - I am at the disposal of the honourable Mr Crowley if he would like to speak with me later on and has a supplementary question .
<en> As for the question concerning the break in transmission of the Chinese TV Channel NTDTV , The Commission was very much aware of this problem , and therefore asked Eutelsat to clarify the situation .
<en> We received a letter from Eutelsat which answered that the irreversible loss of one of the V5 's two solar panels has been confirmed both by Eutelsat and by the satellite manufacturer , Thales Space .
<en> To safeguard the satellite 's operation , Eutelsat switched off the four transponders providing direct-to-home television services while keeping the 20 remaining transponders used for telecommunication services .
<en> As Eutelsat does not operate any other satellite with coverage of Asia , they have provided their customers , including the service provider of NTDTV , with a list of competitor satellites with appropriate coverage and availability capacity .
<en> Eutelsat also pointed out that their satellites carried channels representing all channels , cultures and political viewpoints .
<en> They refrain from indulging in the slightest judgement as to the ideological and political positioning of the channels .
<en> Eutelsat reaffirmed to the Commission that they had not taken any action against NTDTV at the behest of the Government of China or anyone else .
<en> NTDTV is actually still carried by one of their European satellites .
<en> Eutelsat also supplied technical information showing that , in order to receive NTDTV , rather large satellite dishes were necessary , which made it unlikely that a significant part of the population of the People 's Republic of China could receive it .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Can you give an estimate as to when the service provision and the broadcasting capacity will be restored ?
<en> My second question is related to that : do you think we will be able to create a ' Europe without borders ' for television as well , with all the national broadcasting services being received throughout Europe ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Concerning the first question , Eutelsat has told us that the breakdown is irreversible and that the transmission of TV services cannot be resumed .
<en> So it is a purely technical question .
<en> Unfortunately , the capacity is only 50 % , so the energy which can be taken up is only 50 % .
<en> It is a technical question which , unfortunately , cannot be solved .
<en> Now to the more fundamental question from the honourable Member as to whether we should , some day , have a ' Europe without borders ' for television .
<en> We are not yet there .
<en> We have our Television without Frontiers Directive , which is now implemented in an Audiovisual Services without Frontiers Directive , where I hope very much that the video-on-demand services can become Europe-wide services .
<en> The dream , of course , is that one day there will no longer be any borders and that citizens , wherever they are , can receive whatever TV channels they want .
<en> We are not yet there because the selling of rights is still done under a national system .
<en> One day , Europe will arrive at a situation where the selling of rights can also be done at a European level .
<en> I favour this .
<en> I cannot impose it , but I favour it , and I believe that slowly but surely we will move beyond the national selling of rights to the European selling of rights .
<sp>
<en> I apologise to the remaining two questioners for Commissioner Reding , but Questions Nos 51 and 52 will be answered in writing .
<en> Subject : Irish as an official working language of the European Union
<en> How does the Commission intend to implement its new strategy for multilingualism , particularly with regard to the strengthening of the Irish language as an official working language of the European Union ?
<sp>
<en> Commission Member . - ( RO ) The European Commission 's new strategy on multilingualism , entitled ” Multilingualism - An asset for Europe - A shared commitment ” , was adopted on 18 September 2008 .
<en> The main topic of the strategy is linguistic diversity and the best way of using and developing it in order to foster intercultural dialogue , to stimulate the competitiveness of European companies , and to improve the skills and work-finding abilities of European citizens .
<en> The strategy focuses on encouraging the learning and use of foreign languages in the Member States , not on the in-house linguistic state of affairs of European institutions .
<en> We reassert our commitment to developing the citizens ' ability of communicating in two languages other than their native languages ; at the same time , we stress the need of making available a wider range of languages for citizens to choose from according to their interest .
<en> The Commission will rely on existing community programs , particularly on the Lifelong Learning Programme , to support Member States in promoting foreign languages by enforcing this strategy .
<en> Through Regulation 1 of the Council of 15 April 1958 , amended by article 1 of Regulation 920 / 2005 ( EC ) of the Council of 13 June 2005 , Irish became an official working language of European Union institutions as of 1 January 2007 .
<en> However , articles 2 and 3 of the Regulation provide for a partial derogation , renewable every 5 years , concerning the use of Irish by European Union institutions .
<en> Basically , this derogation implies that for the time being only proposals for regulations within the codecision procedure and certain related documents , as well as direct communication with the public , are translated from or into Irish .
<en> Therefore , according to the above-mentioned provisions , the Commission performed all the Irish translations required for the legislative process , and succeeded in transmitting them on time .
<en> Moreover , answers were given in Irish to the questions addressed to the Commission by citizens or by legal entities .
<en> The Commission also started to make available Irish versions of its most important web pages , with priority to content of particular interest to Irish speakers .
<en> As far as interpretation is concerned , DG Interpretation is capable of meeting all interpretation demands , from and into Irish , coming from the Council , the Commission or the Committees , and will endeavour to do so in the future , making sure it has the necessary resources .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I am voting in favour of Marianne Mikko 's report on concentration and pluralism in the media in the EU .
<en> Access to free and diverse media in all Member States is vitally important these days .
<en> The two-pillar model that was introduced for private and public television and audiovisual media services has developed very well .
<en> So that this development process can continue as fruitfully as possible , stable funding must be provided for public broadcasting corporations , enabling them to promote public interests and social values , to preserve pluralism in the media and to give people access to high-quality content .
<en> I also support the creation of a charter for media freedom .
<en> This would be a bridgehead for efforts to guarantee freedom of expression .
<en> Provision for the independence of journalists , however , must be made by means of specific legal and social guarantees .
<en> The concentration of media ownership is also a problem , since it encourages the emergence of monopolies .
<en> There is therefore a need to merge competition and media legislation in order to guarantee access , competition and quality .
<en> The report more or less covers all the main points , and for this reason I am backing the rapporteur .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) As we all agree , pluralism should be a vital element of the mass media .
<en> Pluralism must be supported , and the adoption of the Mikko report constitutes a major step in this direction .
<en> The need for a balanced mass media market should be recognised and supported by the Member States , which should commit themselves , both individually and collectively , to giving European citizens the opportunity of obtaining accurate and diverse information .
<en> Cultural diversity , as well as the ever-increasing need for integration of the migrant population and of minorities , along with the importance of providing quality information to the active population , are the priority reasons for creating a Media Freedom Charter .
<en> I would like to express my full support for the European Parliament 's recommendation that public media services should be encouraged to act as alternative providers of information to ones based exclusively on commercial criteria .
<en> Active exercise of rights and obligations by European citizens , and their being informed and capable of understanding and criticising the provision of information is a necessity which should bear on every measure to be adopted in the future both by European institutions and by each Member State .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - New technology has led to the emergence of new media channels and changes in media content .
<en> A wide-spanning media system is essential for nurturing democracy and free thought .
<en> I broadly voted in support of Marianne Mikko 's recommendations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) Concentration in the media is a widespread evil and must be combated .
<en> First of all , however , there are several countries in the EU where concentration in the media is a problem , and it is therefore unacceptable to mention only one country .
<en> Secondly , in several places the report calls on the European Commission to act in an area of activity that is covered by the subsidiarity principle .
<en> Had that been amended , or had I been able to vote for such an amendment , I would have approved the Mikko report .
<sp>
<2en> The increase in media ownership by the few makes for greater monopolies and stifles the essential diversity of opinion .
<2en> Access to information today seems unrestricted and at the same time deficient .
<2en> Business groups own a large proportion of the media and Internet services and are also their own best-advertised customers .
<2en> It is essential to safeguard quality public television that is pluralistic , open and independent .
<2en> As for freedom of expression on the Internet , the EU should place great emphasis on public dialogue to ensure both freedom of expression and the protection of personal data .
<2en> The debate has only just begun .
<2en> By cooperating with civil society , solutions can be found .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The explanatory statement accompanying this report excelled in demonstrating what is actually at stake and therefore justified our vote against the report .
<en> The rapporteur confirms that Ukraine 's accession to the WTO would pave ' the way to the creation of a comprehensive EU / Ukraine Free Trade Area , including further commitments in trade in services ' and that , to achieve that objective , ' Ukraine needs to undertake domestic reforms and hold ambitious talks with the EU ' .
<en> Based on this premise , the rapporteur gives some examples :
<en> ' speed up further integration of Ukraine 's transport infrastructure , in particular ports and waterways , into the European transport network ' ;
<en> ' full inclusion of Ukraine in the " Single European Sky ” , which may imply some liberalisation of aviation-related activities including airports ' ;
<en> ' insists on the fact that a proper functioning energy market and an efficient oil and gas transit policy are the necessary preconditions for the full integration of Ukraine into the EU energy system ' ;
<en> ' The conclusion of the FTA make it possible to not only eliminate restrictions on the movement of capital , but also restrictions on financial services ' .
<en> More words for what purpose ...
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of the report by Mr Zaleski on the conclusion of the EC-Ukraine Agreement on the preservation of commitments on trade in services contained in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , concerning freedom to provide international maritime transport services in their inland waterways .
<en> I agree with Mr Zaleski that there is great potential for growth in trade between the EU and Ukraine , especially as far as trade in services is concerned .
<en> I believe this report to be fully in line with the European neighbourhood policy , which has included Ukraine since 2004 , and that the service sector is the one in which this policy can be most fruitful in terms of economic benefits for both parties .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the resolution tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the reform of the IASB ( International Accounting Standards Board ) as part of the debate held following the oral question submitted within the framework of the consultation of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation ( IASCF ) .
<en> It is important to remember that through the committee procedure , the European Union , within the framework of Community law , converts the international accounting standards drawn up by the IASB .
<en> In spite of this Community adoption procedure , it is essential to ensure that the IASB functions correctly and the creation of a Monitoring Group is a positive step .
<en> This Monitoring Group should reflect the balance of the world 's most significant currency areas , cultural diversity , and the interests of both developed and emerging economies and of international institutions that have accountability requirements before public authorities .
<en> The Monitoring Group must play an active role in promoting the transparency of financial reporting and the development and effective functioning of capital markets , as well as avoiding pro-cyclicality , ensuring financial market stability and preventing systemic risk .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this report which has now been appropriately debated in committee and on the floor .
<en> It is vital that we have a strong monitoring body which is made up of institutions which are responsible to elected bodies .
<en> I hope now that the transparency of decisions can be seen as just as essential as the decisions themselves .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the European Parliament 's resolution of 9 October 2008 tabled by six political groups , including the PPE-DE , on the situation in Belarus after the parliamentary elections of 28 September 2008 .
<en> The statements by President Alexander Lukashenko had given us some hope : he had publicly called for open and democratic elections on 10 July 2008 and had reiterated this call on television on 29 August 2008 , promising that the elections would be unprecedented in terms of fairness .
<en> It is unacceptable that , in spite of a few minor improvements , the elections of 28 September 2008 fell short of internationally recognised democratic standards , as confirmed by the OSCE Election Observation Mission .
<en> For fear of democracy , the last dictator in Europe wasted an opportunity to join the procession of the magnificent and great historical developments that we have witnessed since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of communism .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report due to the pressing need for the Member States to transpose social legislation and to ensure it is duly enforced .
<en> The health and well-being of freight transport drivers as well as the safety of other road users depend on clear rules concerning issues such as working time , driving hours and periods of rest , as well as on effective inspections and penalties for non-compliance .
<en> It is thus very important that Member States speed up the transposition of Directive 2002 / 15 / EC , and also that the European Parliament assert the support for the inclusion of all road transport drivers within the working time legislation applicable in this field , regardless of their employment status .
<en> I can see no reason why self-employed drivers should be exempt from measures which contribute to the safety of our roads .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) It is with great hesitation that we have chosen to vote in favour of this report .
<en> However , the road transport sector is a cross-border question and working conditions for self-employed drivers are part of that question .
<en> There are parts of the report of which we do not approve , for example the question of safe and secure parking areas for professional drivers , which we regard as a matter for the Member States .
<en> In addition , we consider that questions relating to working time in general are also a matter for the Member States .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The EU 's social legislation in the area of road transport is of great importance .
<en> Road transport is of vital economic importance across the Union .
<en> It is also important , however , that social legislation be applied in order to protect both drivers and the public at large .
<en> There are anomalies in the existing legislation and there have been shortcomings in national transposition .
<en> Accordingly I voted in favour of the Cercas report .
<sp>
<2en> Road transport is one of the economic areas that plays a very important role in the European internal market .
<2en> This area is especially important with regard to employment , as more than 3 million people work in the EU transport industry .
<2en> Despite an abundance of EU legislation aiming to ensure the road safety of European citizens and the health and safety of passenger and freight transport drivers , cases of breaches of the rules on rest periods and breaks are on the increase in the Member States .
<2en> This situation has two main causes : the failure of Member States to transpose legislation on road transport into national legislation , or to do so diligently .
<2en> The health and safety requirements applied to drivers with an employment contract differ from those applied to drivers who are self-employed .
<2en> The present situation , where legislation on working time is applied only to those with work contracts and not to the self-employed , threatens to distort competition in the transport industry .
<2en> The number of fictitious self-employed drivers is increasing , as health and safety requirements for self-employed drivers are less stringent .
<2en> This situation not only encourages unfair competition , but also endangers the health and safety of drivers and other road users .
<2en> The European Commission aims to ensure that self-employed drivers comply with the same rules laid down in the relevant legislation .
<2en> These measures would enable us to achieve much better levels of road safety and to ensure appropriate health and safety conditions for drivers as well as fair competition in the road transport sector .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) This proposal is an attempt to take earlier decisions seriously through better controls , better information , secured parking places on motorways and the abolition from 23 March 2009 of exemptions for self-employed workers .
<en> The transposition and implementation of social legislation on road transport in national law is hopelessly behind .
<en> The four Member States that fall short in that respect are protected as long as they are not named openly .
<en> The fact that they do not regulate working and driving times and rest periods is bad for road safety and for the welfare of professional drivers .
<en> My party , the SP , is supporting the plan to do something about this , although better proposals have already been rejected in earlier votes .
<en> We are doing that because we believe that it is important to comply with social legislation and because self-employed drivers are also to be covered by the Directive .
<en> That will put a stop to the abuse of employers forcing their workers to become self-employed and not on the staff .
<en> Being falsely classified as self-employed , they have worse working conditions and have to take on impossible business risks .
<en> The competition in that sector is fierce .
<en> The talk about complying with the rules has to be turned into action .
<en> Only then can drivers still earn enough and make a secure living .

<en> ( HU ) Thank you , Mr President , Commissioner .
<en> The Internet , games consoles and computer games contain a great deal of violent , brutal and erotic content , and can also cause dependency , insomnia , agitation and eating disorders .
<en> Most children are not yet prepared for this type of content and there is the risk that they will grow up to be psychologically disturbed , deviant adults .
<en> Modern technology undoubtedly makes it possible to filter out undesirable content by means of software applications , just as we are able to do with spam - unsolicited email - and to block harmful webpages on computers used by children .
<en> Information about this facility should be made widely known among parents and computer manufacturers should be urged to make such programs available as part of the mandatory content of new computers .
<en> What is needed is a sort of digital environmental protection .
<en> It is obvious that some people interpret this as an attempt to curtail the freedom of the Internet , but in my opinion , protecting the mental health and dignity of our children is a higher value .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Mr President , the number of Europeans connected to the Internet is growing exponentially .
<en> Children are spending ever more time on the web and criminal activities on websites which are easily accessible to young people are mushrooming at a similar rate .
<en> In the current situation , where the Interpol database has registered more than five hundred thousand images involving child pornography - half of children have already accessed pornographic websites at some time while only 4 % of parents even concede the possibility of their children doing such a thing - I am concerned that the budget for Internet safety is too small .
<en> There is a need to invest in the development of computer systems which will effectively nip such things in the bud .
<en> The European Union must join forces on this front with the USA and Japan .
<en> The disparate projects we have seen to date must be replaced with measures aimed at children , parents , schools , telecoms operators , government bodies and non-governmental organisations alike .
<en> On the other hand , I value the network of hotlines where both concerned citizens and parents can report harmful Internet content .
<en> The Czech Republic , for example , has a hotline of this kind , run by the non-governmental organisation Naše dítě .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , it is an unfortunate reality that the wonderful opportunities the internet presents to us all have , in direct proportion , increased the moral , physical and social danger to our children and young people throughout the world .
<en> This report is therefore right to focus on what we can do to thwart abuse of the internet , particularly with regard to child pornography , online grooming and incitement to self-harm , one of the most chilling aspects of which is sites which actually encourage suicide .
<en> I trust that the Safer Internet programme will indeed successfully tackle these problems .
<en> For me there are three key issues .
<en> Firstly , improving the facility for effective police cooperation and I think that the European child pornography images database must be encouraged .
<en> Secondly , better traceability of the financial movements which are linked to child pornography , and thirdly , a properly advanced common kite safety mark , so that parents can know with confidence what is safe for their children to look at .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) There are a couple of things I would like to say about the report .
<en> It mentions dangers such as intimidation , child pornography , Internet grooming , bullying , spreading racist content and incitement to self-harm .
<en> I am quite sure that the Internet is one of the greatest technical achievements of the 20th century , but it can equally deprive children of the joy of knowing pure and sincere love and of creating natural relationships .
<en> In Internet chatrooms , those who do not use vulgar expressions and who do not boast of their sexual exploits are definitely ' out ' .
<en> I will dwell on the horrifying statistics on child abuse via the Internet .
<en> As an MEP for whom family values are all the more important , I would like to point out that the Internet is one of the ways in which this society can rob children of their innocence .
<en> I would like to emphasise the need for greater responsibility , and responsibility is the key word , which both ISPs , and parents have to take to protect children from accessing content which could harm their natural development .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I fully agree with everything that has been said in the House and I thank the parliamentarians not only for having this debate but also for taking this debate to their voters and to the people in the areas where they are active , because I believe that the basic problem is that adults do not know enough .
<en> Children often know how to handle the new technologies very well , and it is the first time in the history of mankind that children know more than parents , educators and adults .
<en> So here we really have to empower parents , educators and adults and I believe that this is a shared responsibility of all parts of society , not only of politicians but also of the NGOs , and the ISPs most of all .
<en> I am also grateful that , for instance , the mobile phone industry has signed a memorandum of understanding in order themselves to inform parents and to prevent harmful content from being on the 3G phones .
<en> The network of hotlines , which we have established by our Safer Internet programme , is very important and it is working perfectly well in most Member States .
<en> In reply to the question from a Hungarian parliamentarian , the Hungarian hotline will restart in 2009 .
<en> There are only two Member States that do not yet have a hotline and one Member State that leaves these problems to the police forces .
<en> Therefore , we can already say that today the Safer Internet programme has had a very positive effect .
<en> Personally , I would wish that the hotlines were better known : they are well known in some countries but not in all .
<en> So , as Members of Parliament , you could help to make those hotlines more known through all kinds of activities .
<en> I would really thank you for this and I think that both parents and children would also thank you for this .
<en> There were some questions on the EU criminal procedures .
<en> Here I have to tell you that it would be very good if the Convention on Cybercrime were ratified by all Member States .
<en> I can also tell you that the interior and justice ministers under the leadership of my friend , Commissioner Barrot , are working on all these questions , including the issue of grooming , on which Mr Barrot will present a proposal shortly .
<en> I can also assure you that the international cooperation of police and law enforcement is well under way .
<en> So things are moving in the right direction here .
<en> Concerning the question about filters for unwanted content , here again it is a question of informing parents .
<en> Most parents do not know that filters exist and that they have the possibility to use these filters .
<en> That is why I have asked the ISPs when making contracts with parents to really inform them about the possibilities they have for preventing this content from reaching their children .
<en> That concerns very young children .
<en> In the case of adolescents , of course we have to empower the children themselves , and that is why I believe that informing them that they can stop themselves falling into the trap is the best way , because we cannot put a policeman behind each child - that is really not possible .
<en> But children are very capable of understanding what is positive content and what is non-positive content .
<en> So I believe that with the Safer Internet programme we have to empower the children themselves , beyond empowering the parents and the educators .
<en> That will be our duty during the next months and years and , if everybody participates in that , it would be the solution to the problem .
<en> I thank the rapporteur and all the parliamentarians who are helping to make the internet a safe place for our children .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for the draft resolution which prevents the introduction of passenger screening as a means of tightening civil aviation security .
<en> Passenger security is vitally important , but the measures being taken should not result in the violation of citizens ' fundamental rights .
<en> The introduction of body scanning , in the form it has been currently proposed , does not guarantee respect for the right to privacy .
<en> I believe that studies need to be carried out in order to determine the effect of introducing this measure on human health , as well as an impact assessment in order to determine the convenience of these measures .
<en> I also think that the procedures which should be adopted for handling the scanned images are extremely important .
<en> In view of this , the European Data Protection Supervisor should formulate and issue a point of view so that any measures targeted at passenger security are implemented in compliance with the regulations governing personal data .
<en> We await with interest additional data from the European Commission relating to the measures we have in mind for improving civil aviation security .
<en> I was in favour of adopting this resolution today because the fundamental rights of the European Union 's citizens need to be protected .
<sp>
<2en> Globalisation has positive implications for economic growth and employment .
<2en> It can also have negative consequences for the most sensitive and least qualified workers in certain sectors .
<2en> These negative consequences can affect all Member States , regardless of whether they are large or small , long-standing Members or new entrants .
<2en> The European Union 's structural funds support planned changes and their management in the framework of such actions as lifelong learning on a long-term basis .
<2en> In contrast , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provides one-off personalised support for a limited time .
<2en> Its aim is to support workers who have been made redundant as a result of market changes .
<2en> The European Union should pay particular attention to this Fund .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the resolution following the Commission communication on building a Global Climate Change Alliance between the European Union and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change , and this on the basis of the own-initiative report by my Swedish colleague , Mr Wijkman .
<en> It is now established that the least developed countries ( LDCs ) and the small island developing states ( SIDSs ) will be hit soonest and hardest by the impact of climate change .
<en> These countries have the fewest resources for preparing themselves for these upheavals and for changing their way of life .
<en> Climate change is therefore in danger of further delaying achievement of the millennium development objectives ( MDOs ) in a large number of these countries , and I welcome the Global Climate Change Alliance ( GCCA ) that the European Commission proposes should be set up between the EU and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change , in particular the LDCs and the SIDSs and ACP ( African , Caribbean and Pacific ) countries .
<en> In common with the vast majority of my fellow Members , I consider the budget of EUR 60 million appropriated to this initiative to be not nearly sufficient .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of Mr Wijkman 's report on building a Global Climate Change Alliance between the European Union , the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) and Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) ; I believe that we cannot postpone taking tougher action outside of the EU in respect of the joint challenges of climate change and the reduction of poverty .
<2en> Such action would represent a step towards implementing the EU Action Plan on Climate Change and Development ( 2004 ) , based on our better understanding of the fact that climate change must transform the way we approach development assistance .
<2en> As a member of the Committee on Development I am particularly sensitive to this decision , which has the potential to be combined with the international negotiations on climate change in Poznań in 2008 and Copenhagen in 2009 .
<2en> We must overcome the mistrust between industrialised and developing countries , which has posed one of the major barriers to a climate change agreement for the period following 2012 .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) Developing countries have contributed least to climate change , but stand to suffer the most from its consequences and will be least able to deal with them .
<en> The industrialised nations are historically responsible for climate change and have a moral duty to contribute to the efforts of the developing countries to adapt to the consequences of climate change .
<en> The review of the 2007 EU Action Plan on climate change and development shows that not enough is being done to integrate climate change into EU Development Policy and work is particularly slow .
<en> I support the Commission 's initiative to establish the Global Climate Change Alliance .
<en> However , the EUR 60 million allocated to the Global Climate Change Alliance is wholly insufficient and therefore it is important for the Commission to set out long-term funding and allocate at least EUR 2 billion until 2010 , and EUR 5 billion until 2020 .
<en> At present , developing countries desperately lack the funds to adapt to climate change .
<en> By helping the developing countries , we will also help ourselves .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Mr Tajani , ladies and gentlemen , it seems to me that this is first and foremost a procedural problem and not a problem on the substance of the issue , on which it is clearly not difficult to find agreement .
<en> In other words , it is clear , regarding the substance , that any security tool must be examined in terms of people 's safety and privacy and the effectiveness of the measure itself , the cost-benefit ratio - how much these machines cost , because that too is a problem - and I believe that that will become the most sensitive aspect .
<en> In fact , technologies like these are usually easy for well-organised terrorist groups to avoid , whereas they have an impact on citizens .
<en> This is true for fingerprints , it is true for the storing of telephone traffic and telephone tapping - well-organised groups are not afraid of these checks , but on the other hand they become mass checks on tens of millions of individuals .
<en> I therefore believe that we are in agreement that a tool of this kind can receive the green light from the European Union only after a rigorous analysis of all these aspects and only after such an analysis has resulted in a positive opinion on all these aspects .
<en> With regard to the procedure , we have been given a document which , in part A of the annex to document 1258 , has the title of screening allowed ' ; perhaps it is that title that has prompted us to sound the alarm , perhaps excessively , with regard to the procedure , because of the meaning of the word ' allowed ' .
<en> What we are asking is that they should be allowed only after a technical assessment has been made and that therefore a totally political decision is taken .
<en> That is the message behind tomorrow 's resolution .
<en> At that point , it will be for you , following the political commitment that you have made , to find the technical path by which to achieve this objective , and in Parliament you will find a fair partner .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the Committee on Transport and Tourism we discussed the possibility of looking at these machines , following which , we received the first photographs that showed what the pictures were really like .
<en> It then became clear that the proposal should crumble on a technical argument .
<en> As I say , I do not want to go into more detail on this matter now , but there has not been , any impact assessment , as there was , for example , in the case of rear-view mirrors for lorries where almost every contractor in Europe was asked whether he agreed with there being a different type of rear-view mirror .
<en> On an issue such as this , which is so important , nothing was said .
<en> It was not thought to be necessary .
<en> The images we have seen resemble slightly blurred black and white photographs of naked bodies .
<en> That is entirely obvious .
<en> It is certainly not prudery on my part , moreover , if I say to you today that I have reservations about this aspect , as an image of a naked body is a very private matter , and I want people to have the opportunity to decide whether or not people are to see them naked .
<en> We are told that everything is , of course , on a voluntary basis .
<en> Yes , this is not the first time we have been told such things .
<en> Anyone who refuses to fall in with the system would be under suspicion from the outset .
<en> The next step will be its compulsory introduction .
<en> As for the next step after that , I dread to think what it might be .
<en> I believe that this really is an approach that cannot be allowed to prevail as it stands .
<en> In a few years ' time it will be compulsory , as security people have always come up with arguments in favour of arrangements such as this .
<en> Moreover , the next step after that is certain to be data retention , even if this is still at present rejected .
<en> We know , however , that whatever security people can do technically will in time be done .
<en> Commissioner , the European Union is in this way succeeding only in making itself still more unpopular and in sliding still further down the popularity stakes .
<en> That is because the Member States will blame the EU and not take on the responsibility for introducing this system .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to thank Mr Tajani , and to make a few points .
<en> The first is that in recent years airports have become the places in which the ' security ' obsession finds its prime application .
<en> There is a common thread running through this proposal and the PNR proposal , with the indiscriminate handling of air passenger data , and the regulation on liquids , which was put in place after an alleged attack two years ago , but it was then discovered , after the regulation had come into force , that all those who had been suspected of terrorism had been acquitted .
<en> The body scanner is the last frontier in this modern torture , as Stefano Rodotà describes it .
<en> The mania for extracting ever more information that could be useful in the fight against terrorism is fostering an authoritarian interpretation of the rule of law .
<en> There is a clear violation of privacy , human rights and personal dignity .
<en> The new requirement for total surveillance is reproducing the apparatus of social control .
<en> The control mechanism of a ' mass-surveillance prison ' is being developed within society , so that all citizens are gradually being transformed into suspects who need to be monitored .
<en> The creation of these instruments is a confirmation of Foucault 's theories , and the body scanner seems like a page taken out of the book Discipline and Punish .
<en> It is no accident that the main cradle of this strategy is the body : Foucault says that through the political technology of the body we can read the shared history of power relations .
<en> So , for these reasons and in this context the authoritarian character of the body scanner is apparent , and for these political and philosophical reasons it is not , in my view , acceptable to subject our bodies to this tool , which is yet another despotic display of technological power .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are in favour of a European approach .
<en> Let there be no doubt about this .
<en> It should also be clear , though , that as the power of decision is being transferred from the Member States to Europe , the European Parliament should also have far more powers to take decisions and carry out inspections in the area in question .
<en> In fact , this is also what we agreed a few months ago when the regulation was amended .
<en> Today , we have a first set of measures that we need to look into .
<en> There are two important aspects in this respect .
<en> Firstly , there is the abolition of the liquid ban by April 2010 , which is very positive , although we would like to see this implemented even sooner .
<en> The second is the inclusion on the list of possible screening methods of the notorious body scanner .
<en> In that respect , you mentioned that trial projects are already underway in a number of airports , including Heathrow and Schiphol , and that European agreements are necessary .
<en> As I understand it , the Member States in question cannot carry on running their trial projects if we do not regulate the issue at European level .
<en> The reasoning is therefore turned on its head .
<en> I think that we as the European Parliament should get to the bottom of this and that , before we can give it the thumbs up , we need a detailed response to a number of questions that have been raised here and elsewhere .
<en> You have already given an answer to some extent , which fills me with great delight , but I think we should be more systematic with regard to privacy , something to which reference has already been made , and also with regard to the impact .
<en> What are the benefits of the new system compared to existing screening methods ?
<en> We expect an answer from you to this question , and other questions , in a structured manner , and if the answers are satisfactory , then we will be able to actually give it the green light at a later stage .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are not here tonight to talk about technical measures relating to transport nor about whether one machine is more efficient or cheaper than another in terms of security checks .
<en> We have opened this debate because what we are talking about here is an issue of fundamental rights , the right to privacy and the possibility that the irresponsible , bureaucratic and uncontrolled installation of a machine may represent a serious attack on passengers ' rights .
<en> We therefore demand that no decision is taken on this matter without firstly examining its impact , without consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor , without establishing a legal framework laying down who is authorised to see us all naked and in what circumstances , and without confirming how it can actually be guaranteed in practice , at each airport , that its use will be free and voluntary and not imposed by the officers there at the time .
<en> Please tell us who will keep such private images of our bodies .
<en> I myself participated in the work on the Spanish law on closed-circuit television cameras in public places .
<en> This was made law in the case of Spain .
<en> I defended the usefulness of the system , but subject to full guarantees .
<en> These guarantees have not been given in this case and , until they are , adopting this proposal through comitology , Commissioner , is simply an exercise in the abuse of power .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I am really pleased that the gaps in the 1994 Timeshare Directive are finally being addressed by this Parliament so that consumers can look forward to better protection for their investments .
<en> It will also , in the long run , protect up to 40 000 European jobs .
<en> I have taken a particular interest in this report as it covers an issue that directly affects many of my constituents .
<en> We have more timeshare owners in the UK than any other European country .
<en> Therefore , this will reassure many of them that Europe is acting to protect them from scam traders .
<en> The UK timeshare industry is worth approximately EUR 157 million per year , and this directive constitutes an important move forward in eliminating unscrupulous agents who cause problems for consumers and bring legitimate operators into disrepute .
<en> These new simplified rules will ensure that consumers are equally well protected across the EU , while creating a level playing field in the market for timeshare and other popular holiday-related products .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) I am delighted that , despite the spectre of politics , agreement has been reached on the harmonisation of legislation protecting all Europeans who are planning a holiday abroad and who wish to rent accommodation abroad without risk .
<en> The revision of the timeshare directive excludes the registration of unreliable service providers and thereby increases the chances that people will not fall victim to fraud as is all too often the case today .
<en> Consumers will also have a fourteen day time period in which to withdraw from contracts without having to make any down payments in advance and they will even get contracts in a language they can understand , which is good news for Czech citizens as well .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I share in the delight of my friend and colleague , Ms Gill , that we are closing loopholes in this directive .
<en> Timeshare is a big industry , but it also can be a big scam .
<en> For example , I have been dealing with a company called the European Timeshare Owners Organisation , which operates in Spain - but conveniently from an address in Gibraltar - and constituents have told me that they were approached by this company which offered to resell their timeshare .
<en> When they went to Spain at great expense , they found there was nobody to buy their timeshare , but this company wanting to sell them other timeshares .
<en> I have been trying to get in touch with this company for several weeks and only finally this week managed to do so , because , miraculously , the phone numbers they give do not have people at the other end to answer - and they do not seem to respond to letters either .
<en> I hope that we will start now to crack down on organisations like the European Timeshare Owners Organisation , because they give timeshare a bad name and , frankly , they damage the image of the Spanish holiday industry , which I know you care so much about .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) I was unable to vote for the Andersson report .
<en> I do not like the fact that those who were not satisfied with the judgement from the Court of Justice are today attempting through this report to undermine the verdict of the court in the case of Laval in Sweden .
<en> The free movement of services is one of the benefits of the European Union and Member States must pay rather more attention to ensuring that both employees and entrepreneurs are better informed concerning the principles of the posted workers directive as it exists today .
<en> That is the right way to confront illegal employment and also dumping on the EU labour market , and not by undermining jurisdictions .
<en> In democratic societies , rights must be clamoured for unstintingly and not undermined .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the first part of Amendment 24 acknowledges that social dumping was a contributory factor in the Irish ' no ' to Lisbon .
<en> I agree with that and also with the phrase that asks the Council to take action to ensure equal pay for equal work .
<en> The amendment calls for all Member States to respect the result of the referendum in Ireland .
<en> That goes without saying , apart from which this is a legal imperative on all Member States anyway .
<en> However , juxtaposed with all of that is a demand that we must embark on a profound revision of the existing Treaties in order to open the road towards a social Europe .
<en> Talk about using a sledgehammer to crack a nut !
<en> A ' profound revision of the existing Treaties ' sounds like tearing up the rule book to me .
<en> We already have very positive legislation on anti-discrimination and we are currently improving that legislation .
<en> We have reached a common position on the Temporary Agency Workers Directive .
<en> This will underpin the rights of workers and shows that the social heart of Europe is still beating .
<en> Amendment 16 calls on Member States to challenge the judgments of the European Court of Justice .
<en> That is not the way to do business .
<en> We do need to examine the Posting of Workers Directive and ensure its correct transposition in all Member States and , if it needs to be changed , then we must do so , but a profound revision of the Treaties is not necessary .

<sp>
<en> The next item is the report by Mrs Iotova , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on protecting the consumer : improving consumer education and awareness on credit and finance .
<sp>
<2en> The report on financial education which will be put to the vote at tomorrow 's plenary session is more important than ever .
<2en> It is clear that the financial crisis we are now facing can be avoided if consumers are well informed of the risks that various types of credit entail .
<2en> We can definitely say that if in the past we had concentrated more on the financial education of people , we would not be facing the present situation , or at least the crisis would not have assumed the proportions it has .
<2en> For the sake of the future we must be sure that our children are given the opportunity to learn and to handle credit cards and loans properly everywhere in Europe .
<2en> We have to concentrate on student mortgage loans and pension and investment funds .
<2en> These financial products strongly affect the lives of consumers , which is why they must be taken into consideration .
<2en> We must not forget that increasing numbers of young people are getting deep into debt without even suspecting what effect this will have on their lives .
<2en> We have spent many months working very closely on the texts of the report .
<2en> We conducted a very interesting public discussion with representatives of European and US banks and financial institutions right on the eve of the crisis .
<2en> Even then the problems had clearly come into focus , and the alarm was sounded .
<2en> On the other hand , we were able to see the experience and good practice of financial education in countries which have traditions in this area and which are constantly working to improve it - the UK , France , Germany and elsewhere , and we heard the opinions of those who are taking their first steps in this field .
<2en> I am pleased with the results of the vote on the report in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and by the Commission 's decision on the budgets needed to provide assistance on the project .
<2en> We also received many encouraging responses from leading financial instructions on the initiative report .
<2en> I believe we have reached a compromise solution which satisfies all political groups , which is why I hope tomorrow 's vote on the report will be successful .
<2en> We can only overcome the present financial crisis through joint efforts , which is why we need to unite and work together on this common initiative .
<2en> It is time to act and to ensure that European consumers have the knowledge they need about consumer and other types of credits , so that a similar financial disaster is not repeated .
<2en> To achieve this it is extremely important that the Member States implement the measures undertaken and cooperate closely .
<2en> And finally I would like to thank the members of the European Commission greatly for the assistance they have given me .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , this is a very timely report .
<en> It highlights many of the challenges which European consumers are facing in the context of the current financial crisis .
<en> That is why I give many thanks to Mrs Iotova for the outstanding work .
<en> The Commission recognised the importance of financial education for the proper functioning of the internal market in our Communication which was adopted in December last year .
<en> Consumers definitely have to be empowered to take responsible decisions regarding their personal finance , and only in this way will they be able to reap the tangible benefits that come from financial integration in the European Union .
<en> Education is the competence of the Member States .
<en> The Commission 's role in this regard is mainly supportive , but nevertheless important .
<en> The national level is the most appropriate for the delivery of consumer education programmes and it is also the most effective and efficient .
<en> Member States have a key role to play , for example by adopting national financial education strategies based on public / private partnership .
<en> We believe that the Commission 's role is to act as a promoter of financial education EU-wide , showing benefits , coordinating efforts , demonstrating best practice .
<en> In this regard we have implemented several practical initiatives and created the expert group on financial education , which held its first meeting in October , devoted to discussions on the national strategies for financial education .
<en> We have also been advancing the development of the Dolcetta online tools for teachers to make it easier for them to incorporate financial topics into the existing curricula .
<en> Soon we will be publishing the European database for financial education , an electronic library of schemes run by various types of providers .
<en> Finally , the Commission regularly offers its patronage to selected events giving visibility to financial education .
<en> We fully agree with the general thrust of this parliamentary report and the majority of its proposals .
<en> The issue of crucial importance is the education of children and young people , and the Commission shares with Parliament the conviction that financial literacy should be taught at school .
<en> We are ready and willing to assist Member States in developing their basic educational programmes in the field of personal finances , and a similar concern applies to the idea of tasking the Commission with running EU information and media campaigns on financial education .
<en> Such awareness-raising campaigns should be tailored to the specific needs of the audience and are most efficient when run at the national or even local level .
<en> Again we are ready to assist .
<en> I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its good work on this file and look forward to continuing the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission on the important issues of consumer financial education .
<sp>
<en> That concludes this item .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) Ignorance of the law does not exempt us from its consequences , in much the same way as ignorance of financial mechanisms does not exempt us from the losses suffered .
<en> Finance and banking institutions and insurance companies had and still have an obligation to provide consumers with ' user instructions ' for financial instruments so that they can make enlightened decisions .
<en> This is why I believe that the need to educate Europe 's citizens in financial , banking and insurance matters by governmental and non-governmental institutions is a good solution for those who really want this .
<en> However , providing information to the citizens who use these instruments must be a duty performed by the providers of services in this area .
<en> I think that it is the obligation of the EU Commission and Member States to warn and inform Europe 's citizens about the harmful nature of particular products or services and to regulate the European market so that these harmful products or services cannot appear on the market .
<en> I would like to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur , Mrs Iotova , and our colleagues from the Committee on International Trade and Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the efficient way in which they drafted this resolution .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SK ) The crisis over risky mortgage loans has confirmed that the level of financial awareness among EU citizens is low .
<en> Consumers are not sufficiently familiar with the risks of bankruptcy and excessive debt .
<en> Information on financial products from financial institutions , mainly provided through advertisements , is hard to understand and sometimes confusing .
<en> They do not provide consumers with enough information prior to signing contracts .
<en> The job of informing consumers about finance and loans should begin in school , where the consumers of tomorrow should be familiarised with the products of the banking sector .
<en> Particular emphasis must be placed on programmes for young people , pensioners and vulnerable groups .
<en> I firmly believe that the Commission should create a budget item for financial education programmes at an EU level , which could bring together all of the relevant bodies , such as the state , non-governmental organisations , consumer organisations and financial institutions .
<en> I would like particularly to emphasise the role of the consumer organisations at a Community level and also at an intra-state level , since they know best the special needs of the target groups in the area of educational programmes .
<en> Many Member States fail to assign adequate funding in their budgets to consumer protection policies and fail to give attention or financial support to the activities of consumer organisations .
<en> There are few consumers who can afford the services of personal financial advisers and I therefore firmly believe that consumers should be provided with independent advice on proper training courses via EU educational programmes and within the framework of consumer organisations .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to congratulate Mrs Iotova for the subject matter dealt with by this report .
<2en> I consider financial education to be a very important topic .
<2en> At the moment in Romania , we are facing the problem of people who are no longer managing to pay their debts because they have taken out credit from different banks .
<2en> Not only have they been badly advised about the implications of this credit , but they have not been given any kind of adequate financial education to allow them to decide which financial service might suit them better .
<2en> We must not confuse financial education with information supplied to consumers .
<2en> Financial education programmes need to be developed according to the age groups and needs of the various sections of the population .
<2en> I hope that the Dolceta service will be translated into Romanian and Bulgarian as soon as possible so that all the citizens of the Member States can benefit from it .

<sp>
<en> ( DE ) My question relates to the Union for the Mediterranean , initiated by President Sarkozy .
<en> Can it be used as an effective tool with regard to this matter ?
<en> I would like to mention two specific issues .
<en> Firstly , the immigrants from North Africa : what is being done to create jobs there ?
<en> Secondly , the transit immigrants from West Africa : is it not possible to create reception centres in North Africa itself ?
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , I wish to say that Mr Posselt 's question is pertinent .
<en> The Union for the Mediterranean is , to begin with , a union for practical projects .
<en> It also has an intercultural vision .
<en> It is obviously linked to economic development , and everything related to codevelopment is included in economic development .
<en> Thus , in one way or another , I can confirm to Mr Posselt that these aspects will be dealt with at the appropriate time , in the framework of the projects and discussions on economic development between the two shores of the Mediterranean .
<en> Subject : Opening of dialogue in Cuba
<en> The Council Conclusions on Cuba of 23 June 2008 have been very well received in Cuban democratic circles , which appreciate the fact that the unconditional release of all political prisoners is a key priority for the EU and that it supports respect for human rights and genuine progress towards a pluralist democracy .
<en> In line with the commitments the Council made in its Conclusions , can it indicate what effective measures it is taking to further develop dialogue with the representatives of civil society and the democratic opposition ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Madam President , Mr Masip , as you have underlined , the Council did indeed decide , on 23 June , to resume relations with Cuba , in light of certain recent positive human rights developments .
<en> The Council first decided to resume a dialogue , without pre-conditions , between the European Union and Cuba , based on reciprocity and dealing with all issues of mutual interest .
<en> This dialogue is seeking concrete results , especially in human rights issues .
<en> In this framework , Mr Masip , the first session of the political dialogue between the European Union and Cuba at ministerial level was held in Paris on 16 October .
<en> Secondly , in its conclusions of 23 June , the Council reaffirmed that it would continue its dialogue with representatives from civil society and the democratic opposition during high-level visits , where questions on human rights will always be raised .
<en> If necessary , meetings with the opposition will be organised in the framework of these visits .
<en> The Council also stressed that the Union would continue to offer , to all sectors of Cuban society , its practical support for peaceful change on the island .
<en> To apply these conclusions , the organisations which represent this opposition will be regularly invited to present their views on the current political developments at the time .
<en> Finally , the Council reaffirmed that the Union stands ready to contribute constructively to the development of all sectors of Cuban society , including development cooperation and , in the context of this commitment , as you know , Commissioner Louis Michel has just been on an official visit to Cuba to agree the outlines of this cooperation and practical projects which may be initiated .
<en> Besides Mr Michel 's visit , you will see that the Council has introduced many measures in application of the June conclusions and , next June , at the end of the Czech Presidency , the Council will begin to assess the political dialogue with Cuba and assess its results .
<en> The dialogue will continue on these bases , if it appears that Cuba is meeting the expectations expressed by the Union , especially on human rights issues .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Thank you very much , Mr Jouyet , on behalf of my colleague , Luis Yañez-Barnuevo García , a person of dignity and democracy who supports the Cuban opposition and the Cuban people .
<en> You must keep up with your efforts to maintain these priorities and to keep the focus on this dialogue with the Cuban opposition .
<en> We have to achieve democracy in Cuba and ensure Europe 's commitment to Cuba .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) Despite reports of ' changes ' in Cuba , the facts show that Cuba is still not a free and democratic country .
<en> The reason for imposing political and diplomatic sanctions against Cuba has still not gone away , since 55 of the original 75 dissidents still remain in prison .
<en> In my view , any political decision of the European Union on ending sanctions against Cuba should have been preceded by a transparent assessment of the situation 's development , particularly in the area of human rights and civic freedoms for citizens of Cuba .
<en> What has the Council done and what will it do in order to secure the release of all political prisoners from Cuban prisons ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I am very pleased that we are developing our space programme in cooperation with the Russians .
<en> However , we must remember that in the background there is another partner with which we need to establish cooperation - Ukraine .
<en> The best Soviet rockets were built in Ukraine .
<en> Its potential in this area is enormous .
<en> I think that we need to recognise it and use it for our common good .
<en> My other comment relates to the Galileo programme .
<en> We must remember that this programme can and should be extremely important to our military operations and our military missions as well .
<en> The important thing is that the use of this system for military purposes must be adequately safeguarded , so as to ensure that other programme participants - I am thinking of China above all - should not know how to and should not be able to block it .
<sp>
<en> Before handing over to the Council , may I bring to your attention ladies and gentlemen the fact that there are three Members of this House born on 5 August - that is to say , the birthday of Neil Armstrong .
<en> I happen to be one of them , which is why I am aware of this .
<en> I will leave you to reflect on this while listening to the Council .
<sp>
<2en> That does not surprise me , Mr President , and I am very happy for you , you are well worthy of it !
<2en> Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , honourable Members , I will be very brief as much has already been said .
<2en> Firstly , your speeches and debates have shown the mobilisation of your House around the issue of European space policy .
<2en> We are in search of a unifying European project .
<2en> We are in search of European projects that truly stimulate and ensure that new generations of Europeans can take part in this unique adventure .
<2en> We are , as has been underlined , in search of projects targeted to improve the practical lives of our fellow citizens .
<2en> We are in search of projects with a real purpose to develop competitiveness , to associate different European industrial partners and to support activity during this period of depression .
<2en> We are in search of projects aimed at improving research , development and innovation .
<2en> We are in search of projects - to be truly comprehensive - that make Europe more visible , make it a global actor and influential in dealing with the global challenges that await us , whether they be the fight against climate change , or matters of development , or the strategic balances with our other partners .
<2en> I believe that your debate shows us clearly that we absolutely must not relax our efforts .
<2en> On the contrary , we must concentrate all of our means , all of our abilities of cooperation on that most symbolic of European projects : the European space policy .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful for the broad support for European space policy demonstrated by this debate .
<2en> I would very much like this broad support to be shown during the process of creating the financial foundations for a permanent and lasting European presence in space .
<2en> I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our competitors are not sitting back and doing nothing .
<2en> Other regions in the world are already far ahead of us when it comes to the vision of what should be done next .
<2en> If we cannot identify new projects and develop new technologies , we will not be able to retain our leading position in the field of space-based applications , because we will simply not have the necessary foundations in science and research .
<2en> For this reason , I would like to repeat that I was very grateful that all of this has been made clear today .
<2en> If we can work together to raise awareness , we can tell all the citizens of Europe the story referred to by Mr Chichester , the story that European space projects can be the cause that brings us all together .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - Thank you for these important follow-up questions .
<en> Let me say what I think is necessary .
<en> For the success of any campaign or information , we will need five elements .
<en> First , to use the internet and new technologies intensively .
<en> We can only dream of the Obama campaign .
<en> I think they had USD 1.2 billion for their information campaign , but the way they used the internet proved to be decisive .
<en> Therefore , we need to do that .
<en> Second , we need to use audiovisual tools : 60 % of citizens use mainly TV and radio for any information about what goes on at EU level .
<en> Third , we need to engage with multipliers , such as civil society and local authorities ' different networks .
<en> Therefore , we have other faces and other messengers about the added value of working together at European level .
<en> Fourth , we need to cooperate with ' ambassadors ' , i.e. people who are willing to stand for the cause of democracy and who can reach out more than we , the politicians , can do .
<en> Fifth , we need to reach young people and women , who tend to vote less and be less enthusiastic about the European Union which , not least , the referendums in Ireland , and previously in France and the Netherlands , showed us .
<en> These things are necessary .
<en> What about the money then ?
<en> What kind of budget do we have ?
<en> We have been able to identify some EUR 8.5 million in our budget for next year to cover centrally and decentrally managed actions that are linked to next year 's elections .
<en> Our representations have been instructed to devote the bulk of their modest communication means to the EP elections and , in fact , out of the decentralised monies that they have , they have allocated 60 % to this task .
<en> We also now have meetings at a technical level with your services in Parliament to compare notes on the different activities in the different Member States .
<en> This year , we have activities aimed at the elections that represent around EUR 6.2 million .
<en> We have projects targeting young people ; we have special Eurobarometers etc .
<en> There is also money for communication on Structural Funds , on agriculture and on research in each policy area , but we do not have any extra money or special money allocated to this .
<en> I have asked all my colleagues to integrate the elections in their communication plans .
<en> They will be reporting to me on how this is being done .
<en> Next year 's budget has not yet been finalised , so there is still an opportunity to add extra money - but this is what we can identify today in the budget .
<en> So there is not an over-allocation of money , but we will have to use the already existing channels .
<en> We will also help and assist the European Parliament as much as we can with all our resources and through our normal activities , i.e. producing audiovisual material , video clips on EUtube - all of the things that we do on a daily basis we will make sure are used to mobilise voters and to inspire good and lively discussion in the EP elections .

<en> Subject : Information for Europeans concerning participation in European elections
<en> The recent international financial instability , which put a severe strain on international and European banking systems , was a cause for deep concern among ordinary European citizens , who did not see any solutions proposed at EU level or any sign of European solidarity during that critical period .
<en> What steps and what measures does the Commission propose in order to inform European citizens about European policies and solutions at EU or Member State level during times of crisis and exceptional political and economic developments ?
<en> What plans does it have to provide European citizens with information in the run-up to the election and induce them to take part in the European elections in the context of unfavourable developments affecting issues of importance to the EU concerning international economic and trade relations ?
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - I know very well that the financial crisis and its impact on the real economies are of huge concern to many Europeans and , as such , this will also have a particular impact on the European elections .
<en> It is no wonder , then , that most people would like the election campaign to focus on economic issues affecting their everyday lives , such as unemployment , economic growth , inflation and purchasing power .
<en> More recent opinion polls also show that people now see the EU as a ' shelter ' from the current crisis and want the EU to regulate at global level .
<en> The Commission keeps pace with developments .
<en> On 29 October , we adopted a framework focusing on dealing both with a crisis in the markets , preventing future crises through reforms of economic governance , and minimising the impact on jobs and growth .
<en> Proposals to follow this up are in preparation and are central strategic priorities for our legislative and work programme for 2009 , which we presented to Parliament yesterday , and which was debated .
<en> It is important that the need for action has been recognised by the Commission , Parliament and Council and that we are about to propose sustaining jobs , growth and solidarity as one of the interinstitutional communication priorities for next year .
<en> This means that it will be one of the themes on which EU institutions and Member States will work in partnership to communicate on EU activities in this area .
<en> Plans will be drawn up on how best to do this .
<en> I have already mentioned the EP elections , which are another of the interinstitutional priorities .
<en> Here , preparations are more advanced , as we have all known for some time that it would be a priority .
<en> Our institutions are working in close cooperation on all election-related communications activities , and the Commission will contribute actively to the framework communication strategy adopted by Parliament .
<en> The Commission 's goal is to raise people 's awareness of the elections and generate debate on substantive EU policy issues .
<en> This will be partly achieved by the use of our central tools , including the use of audiovisual media and the internet , and complemented by many decentralised activities organised by the representations in each Member State in close cooperation with Parliament 's information offices .
<en> Those events should make people aware of the fact that the voter has a choice between different policy visions of Europe and that these choices will make a big difference to the lives of all our citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , my thanks to the Vice-President for her reply .
<en> I trust that the measures proposed by the Commission will be implemented , because a great deal of time passes between proposal and implementation ; there is the bureaucratic process and I do not know if there will be enough time before the elections for citizens to see the results .
<en> Financing and the information strategy can also bring about contradictory results , which is why particular care is needed to ensure that we do not hit a nerve among our citizens , who do not want to see money being squandered unnecessarily on the events , publications and decentralised activities you mentioned .
<en> Also , debate does not always convince .
<en> Perhaps we should therefore recognise the means at our disposal and be more honest with the citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mrs Wallström , do you believe that the issue of whether electors feel close to or distant from candidates has an impact on the level of participation in European elections ?
<en> Do you agree with a State of 45 million inhabitants having only one electoral district for the European Parliament elections ?
<en> What can the Commission do to ensure that States with a larger population have electoral districts which are closer to the people ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Among the important issues and priorities highlighted by this European Parliament resolution on the European space policy , this brief explanation of vote is intended to denounce the fact that a majority in this House advocates the use of space for military purposes .
<en> This is the conclusion that can be drawn from the rejection of the proposed amendments tabled by our parliamentary group which reiterated that outer space must be used for exclusively peaceful purposes and that outer space must be used for exclusively non-military purposes , thereby rejecting any direct or indirect military use .
<en> By contrast , a majority in Parliament considers that there is a ' growing interest in a strong and leading role for the EU in a European space policy ( ESP ) in order to foster solutions in the field of the environment , transport , research , defence and security . '
<en> In this respect , a majority in Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission ' to encourage synergies between civilian and security developments in the field of space ; points out that the European security and defence capabilities depend among other things on the availability of satellite-based systems ' .
<en> In other words , space can be used in the militarisation of the EU and in the arms race .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I am truly sorry that the excellent proposal for a resolution on the future of European space policy , which has just been passed , makes no reference to the Kourou space centre .
<en> The space history of Europe inevitably passes via Guyana .
<en> It is so obvious to everyone that we no longer think of pointing out that all the Ariane rockets are assembled there and are launched from this launch pad .
<en> My thanks to the French Presidency , represented by Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet , who had the presence of mind to mention it during yesterday 's debate .
<en> To my mind , European space strategy must without fail incorporate proper consideration of future developments of the European Spaceport , both in terms of infrastructure and staff and in terms of research projects .
<en> The Kourou site is the window of the European space programme .
<en> Guyana , which is an outermost region of the European Union , deserves to be recognised for its past and future contribution to this strategic policy .
<en> I would have liked to see this House pay homage to the Guyana space centre and explicitly express the pride which it inspires in all Europeans .
<en> In just a few decades , Kourou has become a major constituent element of our European identity .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The Convention on Cluster Munitions ( CCM ) adopted by 107 countries in 2008 will be open for signature as from 3 December and will enter into force once 30 ratifications have been secured .
<en> The Convention will prohibit the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions as an entire category of weapons and States Parties will be required to destroy stockpiles of such munitions .
<en> This motion for a resolution , which we support , calls on all states to sign and ratify the CCM at the earliest opportunity and to take steps at national level to begin implementing the CCM even before it is ratified .
<en> The motion for a resolution calls on all states not to use , invest in , stockpile , produce , transfer or export cluster munitions until the CCM has entered into force .
<en> It also calls on all the EU Member States to provide assistance to affected populations and to support the clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants .
<en> Finally , it calls on all the EU Member States not to take any action which might circumvent or jeopardise the CCM and its provisions , in particular through a possible Protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons which might allow the use of cluster munitions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the need to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions by the end of 2008 .
<en> This proposal , which I fully endorse , will prohibit the use , production , stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions as an entire category of weapons .
<en> I also approve of the fact that it will be compulsory for EU Member States which have used cluster munitions to provide technical and financial assistance for the clearance and destruction of cluster munitions remnants .
<en> Finally , I welcome the initiative of my fellow Members calling upon all the Member States not to use , invest in , stockpile , produce , transfer or export cluster munitions , independently of the convention 's ratification .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The British Conservative Delegation voted for this resolution as a straightforward endorsement of the recently negotiated UN Convention on Cluster Munitions .
<en> We believe that the Convention has successfully combined principled and practical humanitarianism with appreciation of the military requirements of responsible armed forces .
<en> We have consistently held the view that an indiscriminate ban on the use of all types of cluster munition would negatively affect the operational effectiveness of our armed forces .
<en> We therefore draw special attention to the clearly defined exemption in the Convention for the next generation of " smarter ” munitions which are designed to self destruct and present a minimal risk to civilians .
<en> The British Ministry of Defence is currently developing a munition that falls within the terms of this exemption .
<en> In general , we believe it is important to maintain a sense of proportion in relation to risk management by our armed forces .
<en> While the British Armed Forces always seek to minimise harm to the civil population and limit collateral damage we should never lose sight of the fact that we are fighting terrorist and insurgent elements totally without scruples in the methods they employ for the indiscriminate destruction of innocent human life .
<en> It is these elements that should be the target of our ire .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , as a Dutch MEP , I followed this legislation with due attention and care .
<en> In my low-lying country , the situation is very specific .
<en> Unlike other areas in Europe , it is impossible to work with buffer zones prescribed by Europe along all water courses .
<en> This would not work .
<en> It would make normal sustainable production in farming and horticulture impossible .
<en> The Netherlands , however , is also known for its minor crops , including tulips , onions and chicory .
<en> This is why we should pay specific attention to how the compromise is to be worded .
<en> The compromise that is now being struck is a great improvement on the one in Mrs Breyer 's proposal , which was the subject of vote in the Commission .
<en> As a member of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I voted against on that occasion .
<en> There are now sound transitional provisions which , in combination with innovation and replacement products , can help industry along .
<en> Moreover , this fund for minor crops that is about to be introduced will give these alternatives a shot in the arm .
<en> Also , the three regulations , the three zones in Europe for recognition and admission are also much better aligned with actual practice .
<en> I should like to add one area of concern , namely the admission of products from outside the European Union .
<en> We lead the way when it comes to striking a good balance between public health and practical applicability , but what happens with external imports ?
<en> This competitive position , along with the parallel import and parallel trade should , to my mind , be raised in the WTO , where matters of this kind are discussed .
<en> We can endorse the proposal .
<en> I should like to thank the rapporteurs and particularly Mrs Klass and Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges for their efforts in this respect .
<en> All that remains is this one area of concern that matters to farmers , namely we are practising sustainable farming , but what about everyone else ?
<en> This problem remains unresolved for the time being , and I would appreciate hearing your reaction to this .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Fellow Members , food security is a major goal of the European Union , but this is a poor compromise .
<en> Hungary will oppose this report in Council , and the Hungarian Members of the European Parliament do likewise , because it is damaging to European agriculture .
<en> We face two particularly important problems .
<en> The zone system is artificial and contrary to the European Union 's principle of subsidiarity , and , as the remarks of my fellow Member from the Netherlands have just demonstrated , it makes flexible response impossible .
<en> It is further harmful to European agriculture because the level of risks increases , the danger of resistance increases , production costs rise , and because , as many of my fellow Members have mentioned , we will not be able to monitor the products of third countries .
<en> For this reason , this directive poses extremely serious dangers .
<en> Finally , the consequence of radical environmentalist perspectives is that restrictions on plant protection products will make way for GMOs , which would not be desirable in Europe .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to thank those who worked on these two important reports .
<en> One would imagine from the contributions of some here this evening that the EU had absolutely no control currently on the marketing and use of these chemicals - we do !
<en> We have strict rules at the moment and , indeed , rules on residues and food .
<en> So I bow to neither side nor extreme of this debate this evening , particularly those who fail to see the need for plant protection products in food production and those who say that these two pieces of legislation are a disaster for farming and the food production in Europe .
<en> I am a bit concerned about the comments of Commissioner Dimas when he says that people are worried about pesticides .
<en> Yes , that may be the case , but the question is : how justified are these worries ?
<en> What have you done as the Commission to point out to consumers that the vast bulk of our food is produced using products to give us quality , safe food ?
<en> Yes , some ingredients used in chemicals are very hazardous , but the risks of using them depend on how they are used and depend on compliance with maximum residue levels ( MRLs ) in our food .
<en> As far as I am concerned , those who use them are well-trained , in my experience , and we need perhaps to step up the training in other Member States .
<en> Twenty-two substances are on the way out ; in Ireland and the UK there are huge concerns about cereal production and potatoes .
<en> The questions are : will the agrochemical industry respond and produce new products ?
<en> The Commission does not have the answer to that question .
<en> Will the derogations work ?
<en> What happens if there are no alternatives ?
<en> I think that that needs to be addressed , because we in Ireland want to continue producing cereals and potatoes .
<en> The question of imported food is a very real one , and I beg for five seconds extra on it .
<en> If the Commission would work with EU food producers on this , we could make progress .
<en> It is just not tenable that the Commission can sit here and say that we will ban the use of substances in Europe but that those outside the European Union can continue to send us food using those substances .
<en> It is not a competitive position , it is not tenable , and I ask you to address it here this evening .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , I would like to make reference to the Breyer report .
<en> It must be said that European farmers are fully aware that particular attention must be paid to human health and to the protection of the environment when using plant protection products .
<en> However , the industry is deeply concerned because the European Parliament does not understand the impact that this regulation may have in the future .
<en> Assessments of its potential impact indicate that , due to the unavailability of plant protection products in the future , it is going to be very difficult to control pests and diseases that affect the cultivation of many foods - specifically , all Mediterranean produce - as well as the cultivation of ornamental plants and cut flowers .
<en> I am fully aware that the agreement adopted in the trialogue was the result of hard negotiation and I therefore have to acknowledge the work the rapporteurs have done .
<en> Nevertheless , it must be recognised that the temporary definition of endocrine disrupters will result in the disappearance of a large number of active substances , particularly insecticides , which are of utmost importance to farming .
<en> The producers must have at their disposal a sufficient quantity of active substances in order to effectively and safely combat any disease or pest affecting their plants , bearing in mind that often the danger lies not in the product itself but in its misuse .
<en> For these reasons , the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the proposals requesting an impact assessment and will vote in favour of Mr Sturdy 's amendments - which I have signed myself - relating to endocrine disrupters , and those in support of plant protection products being made available in an emergency .
<en> Furthermore , if this regulation is adopted in the terms of the agreement reached , the outcome will be a reduction in food production and a rise in prices , which will result in our importing those same foods that we do not produce treated with the very products we are banning .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , on the Breyer report , I say to the Commission , why are you against an impact assessment ?
<en> What is so vital or of so much concern that the Commission are opposed to an impact assessment ?
<en> There is no scientific evidence to suggest that some of the products that we have been using are dangerous to public health .
<en> Some of them are , but there are quite a few you propose to take off the menu that are not dangerous .
<en> I am thinking particularly here of one called Triasol which is vitally important to the production of wheat within the European Union .
<en> You have failed , and I mean this quite clearly , you the Commission have failed the general public when you failed to stop GMOs coming into the European Union , and the Commission admits this .
<en> You have admitted the fact that you have failed to stop GMOs coming into Europe .
<en> You failed when it came to the report that I did on maximum residue levels .
<en> We have a member here from DG SANCO - the Commissioner is busy talking at the moment , but when she has stopped talking she might just listen to what I have got to say .
<en> They have failed to control imports coming in with maximum residue levels of pesticides .
<en> They are being found on supermarket shelves .
<en> So , if we are going to ban these products within the European Union , what are you going to do about the imports coming in ?
<en> Are you just going to say : well , it does not really matter - these products are going to be coming in anyway ?
<en> Let us leave it and just assume that people will not bother about it ?
<en> Farmers throughout the European Union have been the most responsible people when it comes to producing food and putting this legislation in place basically means saying to them that they are fools and they are not interested .
<en> No farmer in his right mind would use a chemical which is dangerous to public health .
<en> We have done a huge amount of surveys on this .
<en> I leave you with one or two last thoughts on this .
<en> We are about to ban battery cages for the production of eggs and yet you will give a derogation on that .
<en> Yet that is fairly important to people .
<en> I worry about the fact that you , the Commission , have failed so far to put in place all the legislation which we have .
<en> It is vitally important here that you give the farmers the opportunity to prove themselves and prove the fact that these products are safe .

<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to speak in this great parliamentary Chamber , crowded by Members from all 27 of our Member States .
<en> I rarely get such an opportunity to make myself heard by so many .
<en> It falls to me on this occasion to explain my vote in favour of the report by Mr Belder on trade and economic relations with Western Balkans .
<en> I am absolutely in favour of the European Union making it as easy as possible for these Balkan states to join the European Union .
<en> I believe that it is important for economic aid to be higher than that allocated to date , and that we should make it possible to increase links between the Balkan states and Europe , develop tourism and allow all Balkan citizens , young and old , to live a better life than they have until now .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , first , I just wish to record the fact that I pressed the wrong button on the McGuinness report .
<en> In fact , I completely support the McGuinness report on food security - but I will check that with the services later .
<en> I particularly agree with the point that we need to adapt the CAP to meet food security concerns and the fact that farmers need a stable policy environment in order to plan for the future .
<en> We cannot have certainty , but we certainly need to have some stability .
<en> In addition , I support the fact that the market alone cannot provide income security for producers and also the call for a detailed impact assessment , in particular , let us say , on the implications for food security .
<en> If we look at particular EU proposals , for example on plant protection , again we need a proper detailed impact assessment on that , and we need to take food security into consideration when we conduct that assessment .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I would like to thank colleagues for their endorsement of this report and Marian Harkin for her words of support .
<en> It presents a clear statement of the view of this House on agriculture policy , not just at the European level , but also at a global level .
<en> In particular - and this is important - it calls for a refocus on agriculture policy in the developing world , providing assistance to those who can produce food to do so locally .
<en> I believe the EUR 1 billion that the European Union will provide for this purpose is a step in the right direction .
<en> Obviously , I supported my own report .
<en> I believe it is a blueprint for the future in terms of how this House views agriculture .
<en> While the food security debate has gone off the political agenda , the problem of 30 000 children dying of hunger and starvation every day remains with us .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to explain why I abstained on the McGuinness report .
<en> It focuses on a very important aspect of the European Union and that is the absolute essentiality of ensuring food supplies to those who are starving or those who do not have a proper food supply .
<en> Nobody could be against that , and I am certainly not against that .
<en> But the problem with the report , in my view , is that it looks and refers to the common agricultural policy and does not address the fact that there is an urgent need for the reform , and further reform , of that policy .
<en> It is not serving the people of Europe well ; it is not serving the farmers of Britain well .
<en> Until that burden is taken away from the European taxpayers , then we are going to be in difficulties .
<en> Yes , the objectives of the report are right , but I am afraid that it fails very badly in addressing the core problem .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) I fully endorse most of the proposals and statements contained in the McGuinness report , which was adopted a moment ago .
<en> Sudden fluctuations in food prices are going to occur in the global market with increasing frequency , which will have negative consequences .
<en> Price rises are felt most by low-income families , who spend a significant proportion of their budget on food .
<en> It is just such people who deserve help : the most needy people , both in developing countries and in the European Union .
<en> I agree that the common agricultural policy should be adapted to the new conditions in order to better address the problems of food security , and this is why the removal of instruments which manage markets and a reduction in the level of EU expenditure on agriculture in the future financial perspective should be opposed .
<en> It is a good idea to establish an international body which will observe the prices of agricultural products and factors of their production under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization , in order to monitor these data on a world scale and to be able to react rapidly to fluctuations .
<en> I think the establishment of a world system of storing food supplies should also be considered .

<2en> The Czech Presidency put forward three priorities : economy , energy and foreign relations .
<2en> Thus , the presentation of the programme of the Czech Presidency followed lines that were already known , but it had some peculiarities , specifically with regard to the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> The Czech Prime Minister affirmed the need to respect the sovereignty of the Irish citizens .
<2en> He even considered that , if there had been a referendum in the Czech Republic , perhaps the result would have been identical to what occurred in Ireland , accepting that the draft Treaty might be rejected .
<2en> In relation to the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine , he considered both countries were to blame , underlining economic , strategic and political reasons for their actions , and he supported a greater intervention of the European Union , but he was not very forthcoming with specific proposals .
<2en> With regard to socio-economic issues , he did not put forward anything different , which means maintaining the neo-liberal positions , the proposals rejected by the European Parliament on the Working Time Directive , the Stability and Growth Pact and the neo-liberal Lisbon Strategy , and he ignored the economic crisis and its serious consequences in the social dimension .
<2en> Moreover , in relation to the war crimes that Israel continues to commit against the Palestinians , he said virtually nothing , which we deplore .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) The Czech presidency has come at a difficult time for the entire EU .
<en> The financial crisis , the energy crisis and economic recession are more trying than at any time in its fifty-six year history .
<en> And to add to this we have the June elections to the European Parliament and the latest military conflict in the Gaza strip .
<en> I personally regret that the Czechs do not have the proper tools for the job .
<en> I regret that the Treaty of Lisbon reforming the EU is not a reality .
<en> That is the reason for the lack of a common foreign policy : there is no system for making decisions , and the Member States are not bound by a principle of energy solidarity .
<en> And President Vaclav Klaus ' views on climate change , EU reform and the euro , which are bizarre , if not hostile , have a great deal to answer for in this respect .
<en> I therefore appeal to the Czech government and premier Mirek Topolánek , to constrain Klaus ' public declarations on EU affairs as much as possible .
<en> This is for his own good , as well as in our common interest .
<en> The Czech " three E " priorities - economy , energy and external relations - are Europe 's needs in a nutshell .
<en> I therefore believe that Mr Schwarzenberg 's promise that the Czechs will significantly " push European matters forward " , and that they " will not be bottom of the class " will come true .
<en> I wholeheartedly wish our southern neighbour a successful presidency !
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Economic Recovery Plan - agreed in December - is a major step in the right direction to cope with the current economic slowdown .
<en> It must now see its concrete aspects implemented rapidly and effectively .
<en> In this respect , the Union ought to maximise its efforts in facilitating access to available resources .
<en> We should , therefore - while restoring confidence in our financial market - particularly improve and simplify measures in order to accelerate implementation of structural and cohesion funds .
<en> Cohesion policy is the greatest instrument of solidarity in the Union , and its role in tackling the negative effects of a global crisis of this scale is , of course , essential .
<en> Moreover , let me welcome among the priorities of the new Czech presidency the will to initiate discussion on the redefinition of the Less Favoured Areas parallel to the Commission communication .
<en> A better delimitation of these areas will indeed help in better targeting their needs and foster their development potentials and thus work in line with the objectives of social , territorial and economic convergence throughout the Union .
<en> We need indeed to further our efforts to avoid the negative consequences of the crisis not only on the economy but on our citizens , mainly the most vulnerable ones .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) I would like to thank President Mirek Topolánek for setting out the priorities of the Czech Presidency .
<en> The three ' E 's - the Economy , Energy and Europe in the world , which will constitute the framework of the Community presidency , will suffer from additional , unplanned external events : Gaza and gas .
<en> The problem of the Gaza conflict has political dimensions .
<en> However , it has now become so militarised that humanitarian issues have now come to the fore .
<en> People are dying there !
<en> Not just the Hamas militants who triggered the military conflict , but innocent children , women and men .
<en> The EU must in conjunction with the UN do everything possible to find a solution to this bloody conflict .
<en> Jews and Palestinians can live peacefully side by side .
<en> Please be unrelenting in your efforts to achieve this aim .
<en> The gas crisis has hit many European states .
<en> The dispute between two companies , one Russian and the other Ukrainian , has snowballed into a dispute between the two countries .
<en> Now many citizens in many countries are suffering considerably as a result , and their energy supplies have been cut in the middle of a bitter winter .
<en> It has also resulted in significant economic losses , as the gas is also needed in manufacturing .
<en> It is therefore high time to set up an EU-wide oil and gas system benefiting from a variety of sources .
<en> We also have to urgently look for new sources of energy , and use modernised methods of coal gasification .
<en> Poland is taking steps of this kind .
<en> I cordially wish our Czech friends success in bringing the aims of the EU to fruition .
<sp>
<2en> The Czech Presidency finds itself in a difficult situation .
<2en> It is hard to take the reins of power for the first time after a Presidency which , well established as one of the engines of Europe , has already steered the ship of the Union several times .
<2en> Their situation is difficult since the financial crisis is only now making its effects felt all over Europe .
<2en> And it is difficult because they have to contend not only with the extreme Eurosceptics within Parliament but also with high-ranking political representatives of their home country .
<2en> Nonetheless , the programme of the Czech Presidency seems to be one that tries to keep the European Union well balanced .
<2en> With the lofty aim of the motto ' Europe Without Borders ' , it places at the forefront not only the problem of how to manage the economic crisis but also how to affirm effectively the EU 's longer-term principles .
<2en> The Czech Republic is the first country in the Eastern-Central European region incorporating all of the common characteristics of new EU Member States .
<2en> Consequently , the programme of the Czech Presidency attempts a proportional representation of the requirements of new Member States .
<2en> We are delighted that the Czech Presidency 's response to the economic crisis focuses on developing the internal labour force and promoting vertical mobility .
<2en> At the same time I would draw the attention of the Presidency particularly to the need for improving the situation of the most underdeveloped regions and of the Roma minority .
<2en> Indeed , these are social and economic problems at a European level that transcend borders .
<2en> Besides making use of immigrant workers , the ageing of the EU population and the resulting social tensions can be managed in the long run by developing the internal labour force represented by those with uncompetitive knowledge and skills .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the field of equal pay and gender equality has been perhaps the supreme example in the European Union of judicial activism , of the Treaty saying one thing and then the European Court interpreting that in an expansive and creative way .
<en> The Treaty of Rome has one sentence on the subject which you would have thought is very easily understood : ' Men and women shall be given equal pay for equal work ' .
<en> But in a series of contentious judgments - Defrenne v. Sabena , Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange , and others - the definition has been progressively widened , first so as to include holiday entitlements and pensions and so on , and then so as to include work of equivalent value .
<en> It is not at all clear how an employer is supposed to assess work of equivalent value , whether he is required , for example , to factor in the availability of suitably qualified applicants .
<en> My point is not really to do with gender equality , it is to do with the fairness of Member States thinking that they have signed one Treaty , and then finding that it is interpreted in the courts by judges who give it a meaning that it could not possibly have been intended to have .
<en> Before we open the door to massive new extensions through the Treaty of Lisbon , we should put it to a referendum .
<en> Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est !
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , I cannot identify with Mrs Riera Madurell 's report , and not because I am opposed to the principle of gender equality .
<en> Quite the contrary , of course , but the problem with this report , and all similar reports , in fact , in this politically correct House , is its patronising tone .
<en> How could one possibly applaud the reversal of the burden of proof , for example , even though it is a key principle of the rule of law that people should be proven guilty instead of innocent ?
<en> Why are businesses saddled with the annual obligation to submit a business plan for gender equality ?
<en> This is very patronising , burdening businesses , as it does , with bureaucratic nonsense simply to hammer home a number of principles that are universally accepted but are not always easy to implement in practice .
<en> How can we force a business to recruit equal numbers of men and women instead of simply looking at who is most suited for the job ?
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) I voted for the resolution on the situation in the Gaza Strip , as many of the things which are important to the residents of Lithuania who delegated me to this Parliament are included in this resolution .
<en> Most importantly , an immediate and permanent cease-fire .
<en> The statistics broadcasted yesterday by the world 's news agencies are appalling - more than 1 000 dead , hundreds of injured , maimed , crying children .
<en> This cannot continue .
<en> As a member of the European Parliament 's Subcommittee on Human Rights , human rights violations and the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip are particularly important to me .
<en> There should be no obstacles to humanitarian aid .
<en> Aid must be given to those who have been allocated it and who need it most - civilians .
<en> I welcome this European Parliament resolution .
<en> It was greatly needed .
<en> The European Parliament is never silent and must not be silent when people are dying .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , it seems rather futile to welcome this motion for a resolution on Gaza which , of course , I do , because thus far , words have not been heard above the noise and din of rocket fire , bullets and the cries of men , women and children who have been wounded and who have died in the region .
<en> But it may be that today , there will be further movements towards a cease-fire in the region , which would be most welcome .
<en> In that respect , we support the efforts of Egypt to broker a cease-fire .
<en> While Egypt and the Arab leaders may bring influence to bear on Hamas , when it comes to Israel , I think it is the US which carries that influence , although I hope that this motion for a resolution , which was resoundingly supported in Parliament today , will add further to the pressure for immediate and effective humanitarian aid , for a cease-fire and for a lasting peace in the region .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , firstly I was delighted to see that no action was taken against Members who decided to demonstrate during this vote with their ' Stop the war ' placards and their Palestinian flags .
<en> I hope we have now set the precedent that , unlike those who demonstrated for a referendum , we accept the right to make a peaceful point in a suitable manner as part of the democratic process .
<en> Like everybody else in this Chamber , I am , of course , horrified by what has been happening in the Middle East .
<en> The losers are not one side or the other but people of good will throughout the region .
<en> There are Gazan families peaceably trying to bring up their children , who are horrified at the hell unleashed on them by the rocket launches .
<en> There are Israelis who understand that one day an independent Palestine will be their neighbour and that actions of this kind are unlikely to make it a benign neighbour .
<en> In the current circumstances , however , nobody wants to listen to such voices .
<en> I would just say that I am puzzled by the resolution 's insistence on proportionality .
<en> I am not sure what proportionality means .
<en> Would critics of the Israeli Government be happier if it had rained an equivalent number of rockets randomly on Gazan villages ?
<en> I see your gavel raised so I will simply say that I hope that the cease-fire is quickly negotiated and that we can get back to talking and to finding a peaceful resolution .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) I have voted in favour of this resolution .
<en> The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the restrictions on the freedom of the press have been relaxed somewhat in Belarus and that a few political prisoners have been released .
<en> It has also been pointed out , though , that other dissidents are still behind bars .
<en> In order to improve relations , this resolution argues that Belarus should become a country without political prisoners , that the government should guarantee the free expression of opinion , and so on .
<en> Legislation should also be changed and Belarusians should be given freedom of movement .
<en> Even though everyone is in favour of this , I should like to put the following to you .
<en> Should the European Parliament not open these resolutions up to countries with which Europe does maintain cordial relations ?
<en> China springs to mind , where the human rights situation is at least as dramatic as in Belarus .
<en> Or is it perhaps commercial considerations that stop us from doing this ?
<sp>
<2en> The resolution continues an on-going and productive dialogue with the government in Minsk and is indicative of the concerns of the European Parliament and the citizens it represents about the situation on human rights and about developments in Belarus in general .
<2en> The Belarusian authorities have made some progress , which is commendable , but we hope that they will initiate a process of democratisation and not simply make some temporary cosmetic gesture .
<2en> This resolution is sufficiently firm , but also finely nuanced so that it expresses our satisfaction on the first issue as well as our concern about the second .
<2en> Current events in the region highlight once again the importance of transparency in the business of government and of the democratic responsibility of governments to the citizens they represent .
<2en> The democratic values which have been adopted are linked to stability and development for both societies and markets , including the energy markets .
<2en> This resolution is a step forward in reaffirming these values .
<sp>
<2en> Relations between the European Union and Belarus depend on both parties .
<2en> If there is common good will , then dialogue will be possible , as will a suitable neighbourhood policy and an Eastern Partnership .
<2en> Partnerships cannot be built on prohibitions and orders , which is why I welcome the European Commission 's recent initiative to improve relations with Belarus .
<2en> Objectively speaking , we must admit that Belarus has also done a lot to foster understanding .
<2en> Examples of this include registration of the ' For Freedom ' movement , permission for the publication and distribution of opposition newspapers , and openness to the Eastern Partnership initiative .
<2en> The European Union has greater expectations .
<2en> There are , of course , good reasons for this .
<2en> However , there are also good reasons for many of Belarus ' expectations .
<2en> There is a need for symmetry and understanding between the partners in many fields .
<2en> For example , since we are calling on the Belarusian authorities to stop issuing exit visas to their citizens , especially children and students , why does the European Union not take steps to simplify and liberalise visa procedures for the citizens of Belarus ?
<2en> These problems are particularly important to those of us who live in border regions , which are linked by both cultural and family ties .
<2en> In addition to cultural matters and the issue of nationality , the economy and trans-border cooperation are also important .
<2en> Here , too , the Commission and the Council could , and should , do more .
<sp>
<2en> The current context and the future of relations with Belarus present a challenge to the foreign policy of the European Union .
<2en> Some gestures from Minsk justify a resumption of some relations .
<2en> However , it is clear that the energy factor , in the current context , plays a significant role in driving this process .
<2en> This is understandable .
<2en> Realism is an integral part of foreign policy .
<2en> However , realism cannot , need not and should not be divorced from values and strategy .
<2en> The promotion of democracy in Belarus is a question both of values and of strategy .
<2en> This perception of the medium- and long-term European interest must be central in this new phase of the relationship .
<2en> Otherwise , we will produce a future dependency in which values come second to short-term strategies , with reduced success .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to communicate my vote in favour of the motion for a resolution concerning the attitude of the European Union in dealings with Belarus .
<2en> I am pleased that the Belarusian Foreign Minister has confirmed that his country intends to participate in the Eastern Partnership with other Eastern European countries .
<2en> It is , however , necessary for Belarus to closely observe international safety standards and requirements in constructing a new nuclear power station and to conform to the Convention on Nuclear Safety .
<2en> Finally , I am saddened by the fact that Belarus remains the only country in Europe to retain the death penalty .
<2en> If the future enlargement of the Union is to be considered , this barbaric punishment must be abolished .

<en> ( HU ) Mr President , Hungary , too , entered the Schengen area on 21 December 2007 , and yet there are certain issues that have still not been settled on the Austro-Hungarian border .
<en> The Burgenland authorities are not really speaking to us .
<en> Therefore , in June 2008 , my Hungarian compatriots submitted a petition to the European Parliament 's Committee on Petitions , which we immediately forwarded to Commissioner Jacques Barrot .
<en> Mr Barrot eventually responded , four months later , saying that he did not have sufficient information regarding the petition and that they would try to contact the person who submitted it .
<en> Two months after this reply , I myself contacted the person who submitted the petition and asked how things stood .
<en> I was told that to date no one from the Commission had been in touch ; this does indeed make it difficult for the Commission to obtain information .
<en> When I went back to the Commission staff , I was told that they would examine the matter ' within the best delay ' .
<en> I would like to ask the Commission what the expression ' within the best delay ' means , and I would like to express my hope that the campaign for the elections due to be held four months from now will not likewise be conducted by Mr Barroso and Mr Jacques Barrot ' within the best delay ' .
<en> Thank you very much .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , here is a one-minute rapid snapshot of the still rampant European racism .
<en> In Hungary , a few days ago , a police chief constable who had made a racist statement was acquitted and then reinstated after reference was made to a supposed internal investigation .
<en> The investigation did not address the question of whether or not the racist statement had in fact been made .
<en> In Romania , in the municipality of Tărlungeni , near Braşov , a wall has been erected between the Roma and non-Roma families .
<en> In response to a question from a local child asking why they are being separated , the father may perhaps reply : because those living on this side of the wall are bad people , while those on the other side are good people .
<en> Ten days ago we voted to adopt the report of the delegation to Italy ; since then , a week ago , Italy deployed armed forces against the Roma after two crimes committed by persons unknown .
<en> The police forces are sweeping through Roma families with helicopters , dogs and armed police officers .
<en> Thank you very much .

<en> ( PT ) The number of workers affected by unemployment in Portugal is growing exponentially .
<en> Every day , companies announce cutbacks in production , layoffs of workers or even complete closure .
<en> Amongst the most serious cases is the threat hanging over around 2 000 workers at Qimonda , in Vila do Conde , following the declaration of bankruptcy of the parent company in Germany .
<en> On Wednesday , a delegation of workers from both countries will be here in Parliament , expecting solidarity and also our support in their fight to defend their jobs .
<en> However , the scandal of delays in payment of wages and other remuneration owed to workers is also increasing , as is happening in cork companies , some textile companies , and the ceramics and metallurgy sectors , amongst others .
<en> This situation is creating serious social problems , increasing poverty and even causing tragic situations in cases of members of the same family working in the company .
<en> I was able to ascertain this only days ago at Subercor , a company based in Santa Maria da Feira ( part of the Suberus group , in the footwear sector ) , where workers are struggling because they are not receiving their wages and there are couples who are going hungry and already have no food for their children .
<en> These are terrible situations caused by the crisis which is devastating us , the consequences of which can be seen in human faces and people 's lives .
<en> I therefore appeal not only for solidarity but for these serious problems to be solved .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , popular opinion in Hungary has been following with great interest the developments in the water cannon case in Hungary , and would like to have a clear view of the issue as soon as possible .
<en> We request the Commission 's assistance in this matter .
<en> This issue concerns the fact that the Hungarian Government continued throughout 2006-2007-2008 to hold to the view that it had purchased new water cannons at the expense of the Schengen Fund , and that these were used in Budapest on 22 October 2007 to disperse the crowds .
<en> At the end of 2008 , the Minister for Justice and Law Enforcement stated that this purchase was not paid out of the Schengen Fund , which is an EU resource .
<en> The competent European Commissioner confirmed that the cannons had not been purchased out of the Schengen Fund .
<en> A day later , a secretary of state at the same Ministry stated that the Hungarian Government had covered the purchase of the water cannons from the domestic sources of the Schengen Fund , contradicting the European Commission .
<en> My question is : has the Commission looked into whether the Schengen Fund was used in this case as intended , and has it sought to ascertain the truth with regard to the water cannon purchase ?
<en> After these events , the credibility and transparency of the actions not only of the Hungarian Government , but also of the European Commission , are at stake .
<en> Thank you very much .

<en> Mr President , last Monday the British Government announced feasibility studies into five tidal-power schemes in the Severn Estuary : three would be barrages and two would be lagoons .
<en> The EU has rightly set ambitious targets for renewable energy , but the idea that achieving these targets will be pain-free is a delusion .
<en> The Severn barrage could supply up to 5 % of the UK 's energy needs , yet this would challenge interpretations of the Habitats Directive .
<en> The result of legal arguments - or public opinion - blocking the scheme would be to prove the truth of Nietzsche 's dictum that madness is rare in individuals , but common in parties , groups and organisations .
<en> The EU and the British Government should ponder Jeremy Bentham 's philosophy that we should look for the greatest good for the greatest number .

<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur , because I believe that together we have produced a very good resolution .
<en> This resolution calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that joint action is taken in Kosovo , that EULEX acts together with the High Representative of the EU and that synergies are created in the interest of the economic and social life of Kosovo which is in need of improvement .
<en> The EULEX mission must also ensure that the court cases which have been going on there for years are finally addressed and brought to an end .
<en> There are still many atrocities which have not yet been exposed and brought before a court .
<en> Combating corruption in Kosovo is also important , as there are still many criminals at large who remain unpunished .
<en> In addition to what we have already heard , the European Union should consider not only taking action on a large scale , but also focusing more closely on the daily life of the people there and the opportunities for local projects involving local people .
<en> This work is very important .
<en> We must call on the government of Kosovo finally to begin the practical implementation of its constitution , which includes the Martti Ahtisaari plan .
<en> The people of Kosovo must become aware in their everyday lives that they all live together .
<en> In addition , Serbs , Albanians and all the other minorities in Kosovo must be regarded as citizens with equal rights .
<en> The government of Kosovo must also push ahead with its decentralisation programme .
<en> I am , of course , very much in favour of establishing a multi-ethnic European college , which would be another joint institution alongside the University of Priština and the University of Mitrovica that focuses on a shared future .
<en> In addition , I would like Serbia to realise at last that the Serbs in Kosovo do not want to be encouraged not to take part in the government .
<en> They must be allowed to take part in the government , in parliamentary work and in civilian life .
<en> This is the only way in which Kosovo will flourish .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
<2en> We can confirm that the situation in Kosovo is improving .
<2en> We are grateful to the Czech Presidency and to the Commission for their good cooperation .
<2en> I am completely in agreement with Mrs Pack in confirming that the EULEX Mission is a very great challenge for the European Security and Defence Policy , one of the greatest challenges in the entire history of the European Union as a Community based on the rule of law .
<2en> It is a good thing that there is already a legal basis following the statement by the President of the Security Council , which has been welcomed by the Serbian Government .
<2en> There was tacit agreement on the part of China and Russia , who had previously rejected any settlement of the conflict .
<2en> It is essential that EULEX cooperates well with the parties concerned in Kosovo .
<2en> We must not repeat the mistakes made by MINUK , which wasted a lot of money and alienated the people of Kosovo .
<2en> Mrs Pack has also touched on this subject .
<2en> It is very important to clarify the division of competences between the Government and the Parliament of Kosovo , on the one hand , and EULEX , on the other .
<2en> We cannot take responsibility for the development of Kosovo .
<2en> The presence of EULEX in the north of Kosovo is very important in order to avoid partition of this territory .
<2en> Finally , the complete implementation of the provisions of the constitution in line with the Ahtisaari Plan is an essential matter for minorities .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( DA ) Madam President , first of all I would like to express my deep satisfaction with this motion for a resolution and to thank Mr Lagendijk for his sterling work .
<en> The result is a text that is well-balanced and to the point , while at the same time managing to deal with all of the important problems .
<en> With this resolution , we in the European Parliament are first and foremost sending out a signal to the people of Kosovo and to the peoples of the other countries in the Western Balkans that says ' you have not been forgotten , you are part of Europe ' .
<en> These are not merely empty words with no real meaning .
<en> The EULEX mission , the largest mission under the common European Security and Defence Policy to date , is already underway .
<en> It is gratifying that the mission is supported by the UN and that it covers the whole country .
<en> With our resolution , we in the European Parliament are supporting Kosovo in this mission .
<en> We also point out the areas in which the EU Member States can assist Kosovo .
<en> This relates to special aid for establishing the public administration , strengthening civil society and for educational projects .
<en> When we point out areas in which Kosovo 's leaders need to improve , for example with regard to the protection of minorities , this is because we are serious when we say that we will stand by Kosovo in its efforts to create a democratic society .
<en> A democratic society with respect for minorities , coexisting peacefully with its neighbouring countries .
<en> This is not only about Kosovo 's future , but about the future of the entire Balkans region and of Europe as a whole .
<en> The road ahead is a long one , and it will be difficult .
<en> There is only one way , and that is towards the EU and full and complete integration of Kosovo , as well as the rest of the Western Balkans , into the framework of European cooperation .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , the original sin committed when this new country , namely Kosovo , was born involved the feeling , prevalent amongst the Serbian minority in Kosovo and Metochia , as well as in Serbia itself , that the new state , and the entire Muslim majority , were set against the Serbs .
<2en> This must have had an impact on relations between Belgrade and Priština , and certainly also on relations between the people of Kosovo and the Serbs living in ethnic Serb enclaves .
<2en> If the cultural , educational and religious rights of the Serbian minority are not respected , not only will bilateral relations between Kosovo and Serbia , as well as in other parts of the Balkans , become more difficult , it will also make Priština 's road to European Union membership longer .
<2en> I agree with what the honourable Mr Lebech , who spoke before me , stated .
<2en> The government of Kosovo has to understand that respect for the rights of minorities is a European standard .
<2en> We have to strictly adhere to these principles and , in this regard , keep a careful eye on our partners in Kosovo .

<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) It took EULEX nearly a year before it was able to carry out its original mandate .
<en> It is good to briefly remind ourselves today what this original mandate involved .
<en> EULEX , the largest European mission to date - as someone already pointed out - was to develop , and be active all over , Kosovo , both north and south of the river Ibar .
<en> EULEX was also to take charge in three areas : customs , police and jurisdiction and crucially , there was to be no - and I mean no - ambiguous relationship between EULEX on the one hand and UNMIK , the UN organisation , on the other .
<en> Let alone that EULEX 's activities would result in that country being split into north and south .
<en> That was absolutely not what was intended .
<en> For a very long time , it looked as if it was impossible to carry out the original mandate on account of the notorious blockade in the Security Council .
<en> It is only since November last year , in fact , that it looks as if things will work out after all .
<en> It is good - two , three months on from the activities actually getting underway - to take stock and to see whether things are working out or , let me couch this in more cautious terms , things appear to be working out .
<en> The Kosovar police are delighted with the excellent cooperation they are enjoying with EULEX .
<en> Customs offices are finally up and running again , also , and particularly in the northern part of Kosovo , after they were burnt down last year by Kosovan Serbs .
<en> Finally , a start has been made on the huge backlog of lawsuits in the fields of inter-ethnic violence and corruption , which demonstrates once more that EULEX 's activities are in the interests of all the communities , not just the Albanians or the Serbs .
<en> What I really hope is that EULEX 's progress over the last couple of months will be sustained in a positive manner .
<en> I also sincerely hope that Belgrade realises that its current approach of constructively working with the European Union is far and away more effective than trying to re-write history all the time .
<en> Above all , I hope that the Kosovar authorities manage to solve this huge stack of problems that they still face .
<en> At long last , corruption will be tackled , as well as organised crime , which is still far too prevalent in Kosovo .
<en> At long last , Kosovo will have a durable energy supply , based on EU legislation , and at long last , the Kosovan economy will take off .
<en> Kosovo is an independent state and , whether this Parliament likes it or not , there is no going back .
<en> We , the European Union , stand to gain from Kosovo developing into a viable state .
<en> This is why we are there and why we need to remain there .

<en> Mr President , the recent poll in the Irish Times on Monday showed growing support for the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland , with 51 % of voters now saying they would vote ' yes ' , particularly at this moment of Irish economic fragility .
<en> This is an increase of eight points since the last poll was taken by the Irish Times in November of last year .
<en> The ' no ' vote has also dropped six points to 33 % .
<en> Concerning our current strained relationship with the European Union , in the absence of leadership from the present government , an attempt must be made to address the root causes of the Irish electorate 's periodic disenchantment with the EU .
<en> There must be a meaningful engagement with the Irish people to rebuild an understanding of , and support for , the European process .
<en> This communication shortfall can be breached by allowing more positive information to flow freely about the advantages of being part of the EU .
<en> I believe it is important that the positive role of Europe must be highlighted through our education systems .
<en> This should not apply to Ireland alone , but also to all Member States .
<en> I would urge that the communication deficit be tackled at the earliest possible date .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) I should like to draw your attention to the problem of the renewed schism in the Bulgarian Orthodox Church .
<en> This schism arose at a time when the country was highly politicised , at a time when the Bulgarian Orthodox Church , like many other structures , had to uphold its position in the democratic face of Bulgaria .
<en> Unfortunately , this led to the so-called ' Second Synod ' of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church , despite the Bulgarian Religious Denominations Act .
<en> This legislation is very liberal , which allows any religion to be registered in Bulgaria provided it does not serve inhumane purposes .
<en> However the so-called ' Second Synod ' wants to register as ' the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church ' .
<en> The Act states that the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is traditional to Bulgaria and exempt from registration .
<en> The election of the patriarch and members of the Holy Synod is not subject to legislative action .
<en> I appeal to all those who value the freedom to worship in accordance with one 's personal spiritual needs not to succumb to the manipulative definitions of the so-called ' Second Synod ' .
<en> This Synod cannot be registered and has no legal basis .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , last week 's elections in Israel showed that the majority of citizens support the parties that see the reinforcement of the military as the best way to protect the country .
<en> Even though the centrist party , Kadima , received the largest number of votes , the fact that the right-wing parties now hold 65 seats in the Knesset , compared to 50 in the previous elections , reflects the changing views of the Israeli citizens about the Israel-Palestinian conflict .
<en> Those parties are in favour of taking a hard line rather than relying on seemingly endless and ineffective peace talks .
<en> The Middle East must be one of the top priorities in the European Union 's common foreign and security policy and the stability of the whole region depends largely on Israel-Palestinian relations .
<en> It is absolutely crucial , therefore , for the European Union to continue pursuing the peace talks and to restore hope to Israelis and Palestinians that a peaceful coexistence is possible .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , tomorrow Vaclav Klaus , President of the Czech Republic , will visit the European Parliament .
<en> Mindful of the scandal which has developed in Prague , we hope that the President of the State which is the holder of the European Union Presidency will be received properly and accorded due respect .
<en> The justified opinions expressed by President Klaus about the Treaty of Lisbon have become the subject of attempts to cover them up with an uproar in order to conceal the fact that the main source of opposition to introducing the treaty may turn out to be Germany .
<en> The decision of the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe will be pivotal .
<en> According to media reports , half its bench have serious doubts and think that the treaty may breach the national constitution .
<en> This shows that no one should be in a hurry where such an important decision is concerned , and this is understood not only by the visiting Czech President .

<en> ( RO ) After the autumn elections in Romania and the formation of the new government , we have seen the return with a vengeance to political life in Romania , just like in Slovakia , of anti-Hungarian incitement .
<en> The demonstration that took place on 9 February in Sfântu Gheorghe , organised by the Hungarian churches , was precisely in protest against this incitement .
<en> In the petition raised at the demonstration , thousands of local residents of the Szekély Land region protested against the change in the ethnic proportions in the area through directly populating the region with groups of Romanians from other areas .
<en> President Traian Băsescu has absurdly accused the Hungarians in this region of ethnic cleansing .
<en> At the same time as this , during the municipal elections in Cluj , the democrats ' flyers were inciting hatred against the Hungarian candidates , using the same slander .
<en> After decades of discrimination and denial of rights , who is accusing who ?
<en> I would like to draw Parliament 's attention to the fact that in Romania , even now , there is an ongoing process , using subtle methods , of homogenising and making Transylvania Romanian by artificially altering the ethnic proportions .

<en> Madam President , I too would like to welcome this report .
<en> About 80 % of all new jobs in the European Union have been created by SMEs , and in my own constituency of Dublin about 400 000 people are employed by about 100 000 companies in the SME sector .
<en> We must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times .
<en> I welcome the fact that the EIB has a fund of EUR 31 billion for small and medium-sized industries , and I think that more should be done in this area .
<en> Also , the cutting of red tape and bureaucracy by the Commission has to be welcomed .
<en> That amounts to savings for the European Union of about EUR 2.3 million .
<en> I had a meeting recently with Commissioner Verheugen where we discussed with Irish business people the problems that they faced .
<en> One idea that should be looked at is that of maybe having a moratorium on new red tape coming from Europe , because that is stifling business .
<en> During these difficult times , we have to do everything we possibly can to make sure that businesses survive until the hoped-for upturn .
<en> However , that cannot be done by Europe alone .
<en> It must also be done by national governments and by local governments , which have a huge role to play .
<en> If we want to get our small businesses and employment to stabilise in the European Union and in each individual Member State , we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them .
<en> The challenge that we have at the moment is about jobs , jobs , jobs , and we must bend over backwards to try and protect existing employment and , hopefully , in the years ahead try and create new jobs .
<en> That is absolutely essential for all of us .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , the European private company is an effort to inflict even greater damage on workers ' social and labour rights , along the lines of the Bolkestein directive .
<en> While the pretext is being put forward that this company will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises , in fact it strengthens the monopoly business groups .
<en> A form of company is being created with no capital ( just EUR 1 suffices ) , which will be able to establish a fictitious registered office and relocate it anywhere .
<en> The Member States with the lowest level of protection for wage and social rights will be used in order to circumvent and reduce the workers ' rights to the lowest possible level .
<en> The regulation , which is directly applicable in the Member States , is the natural complement to the Bolkestein directive and the anti-labour judgments handed down by the European Court of Justice in the Viking , Laval and Ruffert cases .
<en> It is a consequence and the result of the Maastricht Treaty and of the application of the four freedoms .
<en> The European private company exposes the political powers that voted for Maastricht , which tried to deceive the workers when they voted for the Bolkestein directive by lying and saying that it allegedly did not affect workers ' rights .
<en> That is why we shall vote against this regulation .
<en> All those who support this anti-grassroots policy are sowing winds and are certain to reap hurricanes .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , the fact that 70 % of private employment in Europe is provided by SMEs is a tremendous tribute to their entrepreneurial tenacity , because oppressive EU regulation makes their lives unnecessarily and extremely difficult .
<en> Hence , I would repeat a call I have made before that during the currency of this economic downturn , there should be a regulation holiday for SMEs .
<en> The cost of EU regulation in the United Kingdom has been reckoned to be GBP 107 billion over the last ten years .
<en> That is GBP 107 billion that should have been going into innovation , into intensified export efforts and into growth .
<en> Yet much of that has had to be spent on mere compliance with regulation .
<en> The simplification of procurement procedures , reducing patent costs , relaxation on state aid rules and real action against unfair competition from the Far East are all essential if SMEs are to flourish .
<en> Today we need family SMEs - small businesses - more than ever because they have the type of commitment and sticking power to get us through this crisis .
<en> However , they need our help and they need it by lifting the dead hand of EU regulation from them .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , many Members have raised the subject of participation .
<en> I do not wish to go more deeply into this now , but I do want to point out in this connection that our Member States ' company law also has the function of defending the interests of public policy , such as creditor protection , security of the legal system and consumer protection , a function that is safeguarded in the Member States by administration of preventive justice , for example by means of form and register provisions .
<en> There are major differences between Member States in this regard .
<en> The decisions of the Committee on Legal Affairs take account of this in many places - which is to be warmly welcomed - by leaving Member States ' options open .
<en> Ultimately , however , these things are counteracted , or at least can be counteracted , unless we do something about the fact that the registered office and the actual seat - that is , the actual place of business of the company - are allowed to differ , as this ultimately renders these safeguards meaningless .
<en> The company can locate its registered office practically at will , and thus evade the requirements of the country where it really does business .
<en> In my opinion , Member States thereby de facto - although not de jure - lose a great deal of sovereignty over their company law and its regulatory function , as these can be invalidated .
<en> I wish to add that this will - or rather could - also jeopardise the reputation of the European private company , at least in the Member States with stricter requirements of their own .
<en> One could suggest that we wait and see what happens and then make the necessary adjustments , and I would agree with them if this development were not reinforced by the procedures and the unanimity .
<en> That is my greatest concern .
<en> There is no reason for this course of action .
<en> The case-law of the European Court of Justice is only a stopgap measure because we do not have a directive on the transfer of company seats ; but , in the form currently envisaged , this European private company would basically reinforce this disintegration - enshrining it in Community law once and for all .
<en> For this reason , I would ask the Council to reconsider this issue very carefully .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Madam President , small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the European Union 's economy .
<en> Their great dynamism and capacity to grow and innovate have earned them a notable position in the EU 's policies .
<en> We congratulate Mrs Herczog , because her report encourages the growth of SMEs on the basis of a principle which is by no means trivial : in the political and economic actions of the EU and its Member States , we should think small first .
<en> The Small Business Act contains legislative proposals and political agreements that will give rise to administrative , regulatory and financial conditions with the potential to develop these units within the European economy .
<en> The current crisis and the instability of the financial system are restricting SMEs ' access to credit , and this is slowing down their usual economic activity .
<en> Now , more than ever , we need a coordinated response at European level and the initiatives of the Member States ought to be structured in terms of and aligned with the provisions of the document we are discussing today .
<en> In conclusion , I would like to say that it is particularly important to allocate EUR 30 000 million in the 2009-2011 period to encourage lending to SMEs .
<en> This initiative is in addition to the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and the JEREMIE initiative , and will have a multiplying effect on the funds that SMEs will be able to obtain .
<en> We are fully convinced that European coordination and the European scope of the response are vital in starting out on the road to economic recovery as soon as possible .

<en> The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Doorn on implementation of Directive 2006 / 43 / EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( NL ) Madam President , this report is about the implementation of the eighth directive on statutory audits of annual accounts .
<en> It is a good thing that Parliament is paying closer attention to the implementation and transposal of the legislation we pass here .
<en> We in Parliament can decide on the most outstanding rules and regulations , but if those rules and regulations are not implemented and complied with in the Member States , we are wasting our time here .
<en> In the transposal of the eighth directive , too , many things have gone wrong .
<en> Key definitions are framed differently in different countries and the number of Member States that have independent public oversight is a long way short of 27 .
<en> The report calls on the Commission to take steps quickly to correct these deficiencies .
<en> We also wonder whether the method of harmonisation employed , namely minimum harmonisation , is indeed the right way to attain the uniform application of key concepts .
<en> Perhaps we do need to think again whether key definitions of this kind are the way forward or whether a different method of harmonisation - one that is not open to multiple interpretations - needs to be used .
<en> Finally , Madam President , the report discusses the Commission 's recommendation on the limitation of the civil liability of accountants .
<en> Should further measures be necessary in order to achieve convergence in Europe , we shall look forward to the Commission 's proposals .
<en> The objective must and will remain to aim for the effective and independent auditing of accountants .
<en> The economic crisis has taught us that strict auditing and oversight are indispensible .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , honourable Members , I would like first to thank Mr Doorn for his report on the application of the directive on statutory audits of accounts .
<en> I would like also to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , and more particularly Mrs van den Burg , who has contributed to the production of this report .
<en> In the context of the financial crisis , it is essential that all Member States who are currently behind should quickly transpose the directive to achieve the objectives set .
<en> The Commission continuously monitors the transposition status of the directive in the Member States .
<en> A dashboard is regularly published on our website .
<en> The results relating to the Member States ' performance should clearly improve this spring .
<en> Mr Doorn 's report has certainly facilitated such an improvement .
<en> As your report emphasises , the Commission has already adopted the recommendation on quality assurance and the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors .
<en> I thank Parliament for its support for these two initiatives .
<en> The recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of statutory auditors is part of a strategy to reduce the concentration in the auditing market .
<en> To explore other options along the same lines , a consultation on control structures in audit companies and on their consequences for the auditing market was published in November .
<en> The European Parliament is asking the Commission to assess the national laws transposing the directive and to inform it of the effects of the measures taken by the Member States in the wake of the recommendation on the limitation on the civil liability of auditors .
<en> At the appropriate time , we will be happy to prepare these assessments , taking into account all the issues raised in the report by Mr Doorn .
<en> This is a commitment from Commissioner McCreevy that I am happy to pass on to you .
<en> I thank Mr Doorn and I dare to hope that we will see practical results .
<sp>
<en> The item is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow .

<sp>
<en> ( GA ) Mr President , I would like to say that I understand the reasons behind this report .
<en> However , in so far as it relates to me it is unfair , as this duty , the Eurovignette , is adding to the costs of countries that are a long distance from the centre of the market .
<en> The Commissioner said that mountain regions are opposing the Single Market .
<en> What about areas like my own constituency in the West of Ireland , from where 1 000 lorries depart every week ?
<en> They are hit while going to the market .
<en> And what is this about it being a single market ?
<en> It is not !
<en> Costs are being raised for peripheral countries because you want the greening of the market .
<en> You can 't have it both ways , however .
<en> You must think about the countries on the periphery and give them a fair deal , Mr President , something which is not done in this report .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , no serious scientist doubts that there must be a drastic application of the brakes to the consumption of fossil fuels , as the raw materials are limited and as the combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate chaos .
<en> We all know that around a third of fossil fuels are squandered on travel and transport and that goods vehicles , in particular , cause enormous damage to people and the environment that the taxpayer then has to pay for .
<en> Everyone essentially agrees to the principle of paying the true costs .
<en> Yet , when it comes to the specific measures to implement true costs , we hear a thousand excuses .
<en> It is thoroughly incomprehensible why the actions being taken in response to the crises are not much more consistent .
<en> It is wrong to continue to promote the unhealthy and bloated transport economy .
<en> The 20-20-20 target will otherwise grow ever more distant .
<en> We must be clear that this dishonesty jeopardises the future of our grandchildren .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to thank Mr El Khadraoui .
<en> He has achieved a workable compromise under really difficult conditions .
<en> For us transport policy makers , it is a quantum leap forward that air pollution , noise and congestion can now also be included in the tolls .
<en> This reinforces the polluter pays principle .
<en> The polluter pays principle prevents profits going into private hands while the damage is paid for by society .
<en> That is a social democratic concept .
<en> Parliament has resolved to introduce this principle to all modes of transport step by step .
<en> There will then , at long last , be fair competition between the railways , lorries and inland waterways .
<en> It must also be made clear at this point that it will be entirely up to the Member States whether or not these additional tolls are implemented .
<en> Nobody will be forced to do so .
<en> All we are doing here is setting up the basic framework for it so that there is no patchwork of different toll models across Europe , thereby avoiding discrimination , as road haulage should be treated in a comparable way throughout the internal market .
<en> For us , this is not about additional income streams but is , instead , about directing transport more strongly by means of price signals .
<en> The Committee on Transport and Tourism is right to want to see the mandatory ring-fencing of this additional income for use in reducing external damage .
<en> However , there is still one fly in the ointment , as I see it .
<en> Unfortunately , the committee decision , as it currently stands , links the introduction of congestion costs for goods vehicles to the inclusion of other modes of transport , such as passenger cars .
<en> That will prevent the introduction of congestion costs in those Member States , such as Germany , that do not want a toll for passenger cars .
<en> That therefore denies us an important instrument of taxation in the field of transport policy .
<en> My conclusion is as follows : tomorrow 's vote offers a breakthrough in transport policy after decades of discussion about external costs .
<en> I hope that we will receive the necessary majority to achieve that breakthrough .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , the only reason - at least the way I see it - to look seriously at this proposal at all is that it creates a European framework for Member States to work within , which ultimately benefits the internal market .
<en> Indeed , the ' green ' concept is being misused with increasing frequency for the purposes of a kind of protectionism .
<en> The sectoral driving bans in Austria are a good example of this .
<en> We have come a long way .
<en> A few tricky points remain under discussion , however .
<en> Let me be clear that , as far as I am concerned , the possibility of a congestion charge for road freight transport is inadmissible , and I also consider the abandonment of earmarking unacceptable .
<en> As my colleague Mr Sterckx said earlier , if , at second reading , it emerges that there is no majority in this House and in the Council in favour of these positions , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will withdraw its support for the proposal .
<en> Road freight transport is an important driving force for our economy .
<en> It is particularly important that we do not lose sight of that fact - certainly not at this time .
<en> Allow me , too - I say this particularly with the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in mind - to conclude with an old Dutch saying : the bull-in-a-china-shop approach rarely works .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr. President , the crisis which is increasingly taking its toll on road hauliers should caution us against introducing new charging regulations , unless what we want to do is to exacerbate the crisis .
<en> Transport has always been the lifeblood of the whole economy .
<en> We have had negative experience reforming the common agricultural policy , and this is likely to repeat itself now .
<en> We must remember that road hauliers are not , in the main , vast enterprises , but small businesses with a handful of vehicles .
<en> Let us not make them pay for the upkeep of the country .
<en> This is already being done through tax on fuel , insurance , road checks and through many other charges .
<en> Introducing payments for external costs would significantly increase the cost of transport and mean paying twice for the same thing .
<en> It is clear that goods need to be transported , as there will always be producers and customers for goods which will need transporting , but do we have to make them responsible for the costs of infrastructure ?
<en> I move for the suspension of all further action until better times , or for the complete rejection of the Commission 's proposal .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we should remember that we cannot uphold women 's rights in any document that deals with employment or equal opportunities unless we can count on satisfactory childcare facilities , without which mediation is impossible and rights count for nothing .
<2en> These matters are more pertinent than ever now that we are faced with problems raised by the economic crisis .
<2en> In the European Union , more than six million women aged 25 to 49 state that they are forced to be unemployed or work part time due to their family responsibilities .
<2en> The situation of more than one quarter of these women stems from the lack of childcare facilities or their excessive cost .
<2en> Six years after the adoption of the Barcelona objectives , as the 2010 deadline approaches , we find that most Member States will not achieve these objectives , which were not even particularly ambitious : guaranteeing access to childcare facilities for 30 % of children under the age of three .
<2en> We must therefore work hard to achieve satisfactory levels of availability of children 's services , beginning with services for children aged under three .
<2en> For this reason , I am very happy that today 's ECOFIN Council has approved the possibility for all Member States to cut VAT on children 's services .
<2en> I believe that this is a considerable incentive and a common sense gesture that could help to relaunch the childcare plan and a plan for services for children and families throughout the European Union .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , we find the Czech Presidency 's attempts to water down the EU 's childcare objectives to be truly shameful and we naturally , therefore , roundly reject them .
<2en> It is also a great success that the Union 's Ministers for the Family , as a result of the pressure that has been exerted by this House , did not endorse this watering down of the childcare objectives .
<2en> I also find it very regrettable that the Czech Presidency is conspicuous by its absence today and is unable to discuss its attempt to water down the Barcelona objectives with us here in Parliament , as this Czech move is a very clear roll-back in EU equality policy and we very clearly reject the antiquated picture of women and the family expressed by the Czech Presidency 's proposal .
<2en> Yet , Commissioner Špidla , you have said that there are funding opportunities .
<2en> You have observed that most Member States of the EU do not meet the objectives , particularly when it comes to childcare for the under-threes .
<2en> What initiative will the Commission take in order to make the Member States more active , however ?
<2en> I have , I am afraid to say , heard no answer from you today on that question .
<2en> What else will the Commission do to encourage the Member States ?
<2en> You have also hinted that there are possibilities of co-financing .
<2en> Are these possibilities being used by the Member States ?
<2en> I would ask that you answer this question .
<2en> If not , why are they not used and will the Commission also increase the funding for the expansion of childcare ?
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I very much appreciated the Member States adopting targets within the Barcelona objectives relating to children 's access to childcare .
<2en> I felt - and still do today - that the objectives were set rather low , but we have at least made a start .
<2en> Access to good childcare is a basic prerequisite if women are to have the opportunity to work and it is also a basic prerequisite for equality .
<2en> However , I am now concerned that these targets will not be achieved and , of course , I am concerned about the indications from the Czech Presidency about replacing the childcare objective with care in the home as a fully viable alternative , and that it therefore wishes to remove this objective .
<2en> However , I would also like to thank Commissioner Špidla , who has , in fact , made it clear that the Commission still regards it as important for us to achieve the Barcelona objectives with regard to childcare .
<2en> I would also like to thank Mrs Resetarits for her proposal on child mainstreaming .
<2en> I think that , together , we should bear this in mind .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Commissioner , many of my constituents are babies and very young children , and tonight I would like to speak on their behalf , especially as there are many very good speakers tonight who can speak effectively for women in the workplace .
<en> The care a child receives in the earliest years will have an impact on him or her throughout life .
<en> Many students of child development , like Maria Montessori , have noted the need a young child has for the presence of his or her mother , or mother substitute .
<en> Many of them have also noted a watershed in a child 's development at two years and nine months , after which it becomes safe for a child to spend periods of time away from his or her primary care-giver .
<en> In the last decade , brain-imaging technology has backed up those observations , demonstrating that there is a definite shift in the child 's brain that allows him or her to internalise the primary care-giver , usually the mother , so that she is available to the child in active memory even when she is not present .
<en> At that time , the child can understand that the mother , or the substitute primary care-giver , will come back and is not gone forever .
<en> Of course , life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home .
<en> They may want to work , or choose to , and even if they do not , they may need to earn because mortgages must be paid and food must be put on the table .
<en> Women have been a wonderful addition to the workforce .
<en> Their inclusion and equal treatment is a matter of fundamental rights .
<en> However , babies do not know , nor are they able to consider what their mothers must , or want to , do .
<en> They are hardwired to need what they need .
<en> Nature is a very powerful force .
<en> There are always consequences when we go against nature .
<en> Having a loving invested mother is the ideal for a child , which we should make every effort to accommodate where a woman wants to be available to her child in those early years .
<en> This is because , if that young child needs the constant reassuring presence of its mother , not having her will have an impact , despite all the very worthy reasons for her absence .
<en> However , as I said , women work , and we must do our best to at least ensure that if someone other than the primary care-giver is taking care of the child below the age of two years nine months , that it is someone who can give the child as nurturing a care as possible .
<en> Some children are fortunate enough to receive this care from secondary care-givers like fathers , grandparents , other relatives , close neighbours - people who are committed to them and part of their life on an ongoing basis .
<en> However , this is simply not the lot of most babies and toddlers who would be cared for in childcare facilities .
<en> It behoves us to ensure that those facilities are clean , safe , stimulating and , above all , nurturing , and are not just holding centres .
<en> Children are our future .
<en> The foundation they receive is of utmost importance , but the time , space and nurturing children need to grow and develop fully is becoming a luxury afforded to fewer and fewer .
<en> For better or for worse , we are shaping Europe 's future by how we raise our children .
<en> I would ask the Commission to view this issue for a moment from a child 's point of view .
<en> If you could ask a baby whether it wanted its mum or a day-care centre , it would always choose mum .
<en> We need to listen to that child as mothers do , and to help them find a way to reconcile home and work to the benefit of both .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) We probably all know how important it is to implement all of the Barcelona objectives into everyday life .
<en> Achieving a balance between family life and work life is essential to applying the principle of equality in employment .
<en> It also brings advantages for children in terms of their healthy development .
<en> Support for the expansion of services in the area of pre-school and out-of-school facilities , for parents ' centres and also for the operation of broad-spectrum , multi-functional , daily community centres increases accessibility , flexibility and equality in the system of public social services for families by making them competitive and improving their quality .
<en> The situation with childcare in Slovakia is rather complicated .
<en> Public childcare facilities for the youngest children up to the age of two or three have virtually disappeared , operating only on an exceptional basis , while private facilities are not affordable for most families .
<en> Competence in this area has been transferred to local authorities who can choose whether or not to participate in running such facilities .
<en> The situation with the hidden population of older children from three to six years old , in other words the so-called little schools , is not much better .
<en> According to EU statistical estimates , only Greece , Lithuania , Poland and Slovenia record lower attendance levels of children aged from three upwards .
<en> The countries with social and family policies based on the spirit and letter of gender equality , such as Finland , Sweden and France , have , in recent years , recorded high levels of fertility , while the countries supporting the traditional separation of parental roles are facing low fertility and increasing levels of childlessness , for example Germany , Spain and Italy .
<en> Many of the countries with a high proportion of women on the labour market , such as the northern countries , have , at the same time , higher birth rates and fertility levels .
<en> It is necessary for the state to provide support so that women can work and , at the same time , fulfil their longing to be mothers .
<en> The demographic situation is simply an outcome of the interest or lack of interest shown by the state in the next generation .
<en> By supporting family policies , the state will provide the essential preconditions for families .
<en> The blindness to these values which we have seen to date , together with support for the consumer lifestyle , is probably the cause of the current demographic gloom .
<en> It is also true that pre-school facilities are extremely important for problem groups as well , such as children from socially disadvantaged groups and Roma children .
<en> It is precisely these children who pick up basic habits of hygiene in pre-school facilities and also gradually learn rules of behaviour .
<en> Let us agree that the Barcelona objectives should form part of the national policy of the state on citizens ' welfare .

<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I would like to remind you that this debate is part of a long process that is several years old : European Commission consultations ; the ' health check ' of the common agricultural policy ; the fourth economic and social cohesion report ; and the Lamassoure report on ' own resources ' for the budget .
<en> Our European Commission has announced its intention to present , at the latest in autumn 2009 , its main guidelines for this revision , which has given rise to some remarkable work by our Committee on Budgets , under the leadership of Mr Böge .
<en> We know that this revision will be carried out once the next European Parliament is in place .
<en> It is not our current Parliament that will carry it out .
<en> I would therefore stress a basic political point , namely that we have almost achieved unanimity so that the future financial framework tallies with the political mandate of the future Parliament , and that is an arrangement that we would like to see perpetuated .
<en> This seems very important to me because , finally , we will have consistency between the results of the elections and the budgetary guidelines to be overseen by the Commission .
<en> Next , I wish to remind you that the opinion of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is that the budget should be refocused on the fundamental missions : employment , growth and innovation , as our colleague Mr Färm said .
<en> However , before finishing I would like to make a point of saying that the real future of the Union depends on this revision , and I hope that the future Parliament makes use of the Böge report so that it is able to achieve our European ambition in the face of the national self-interests relayed daily via the prevarications of the Council .
<en> It is up to Parliament to issue European policies that give all of our fellow citizens real hope in a project that is political and not just economic .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , today there are 27 of us and we spend less than 1 % of our collective wealth on the Community budget , roughly the same as we spent when there were 15 of us .
<en> This figure alone illustrates why the Böge report we are debating today is one of the Union 's basic political ventures for the next five years .
<en> It is a crucial question which we must answer : how much money and for what policies ?
<en> Where do we set the limit , the measure of our ambitions ?
<en> This time we must put everything on the table without any preconditions and the discussion must start from a zero base .
<en> We shall have to address two important difficulties in this major negotiation :
<en> the first is that now there are , of course , more of us than there were on the previous occasion when similar negotiations were held ; and
<en> the second difficulty is that , unfortunately , this negotiation is taking place when the fat-cat cycle has closed and we are being hard hit by the economic crisis .
<en> Nonetheless , the negotiation which is basically starting today with the very realistic approach taken by Mr Böge should confirm three basic preconditions which are pivotal to Europe :
<en> firstly , that the future of farming in the Community must be secured even after 2013 ;
<en> secondly , that the principle of cohesion and solidarity between the Member States must not end ; and
<en> thirdly , that the time has come for us to talk about smart development , about money which also goes into brains and not just into asphalt and cement .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , the report by the Chairman of our committee , Mr Böge , which we are debating today is , in my opinion , very interesting and crucial for three reasons : firstly , because it highlights certain sectors which require improvement ; secondly , because it outlines certain proposals ; and thirdly , because it paves the way for the major debate in the next parliamentary term .
<en> Sectors which require improvement relate mainly to the mismatch between political choices and Community choices and the inability to manage our budget resources properly .
<en> Proposals :
<en> one very basic proposal is the five-year cycle of the financial framework and a policy of a five-year cycle for financial policies ; in other words , the term of our Parliament would coincide with political proposals at budget level ;
<en> secondly , the question of flexibility is very , very important .
<en> However , flexibility does not just mean change between sectors ; it means a general response .
<en> Flexibility alone is not the solution to the problem .
<en> So all this is preparing us for the major debate in the next parliamentary term on a new political and coordinated budget on new bases .
<sp>
<en> . - ( RO ) Reducing the financial programming period to five years , as also recommended in the Böge report - and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Böge for his particular contribution to this report - would provide concrete proof of the European institutions ' maturity and an indication of cutting red tape .
<en> At the same time , we must be realistic and consider how feasible such a measure is so that we do not end up in extreme situations where it will take us two years to adopt a five-year budget .
<en> The key question is how we should go about simplifying the procedures so that European money is used within a reasonable period of time .
<en> There are incidents which have already become legend involving European money which has failed to arrive months , if not years , after the time it was really needed .
<en> Just allow me to give you an example involving money from the Solidarity Fund .
<en> As you are aware , Romania is going to receive EUR 12 million for the five counties hit by flooding .
<en> The floods took place in the summer of last year , we voted on the issue this month , but it is likely that the money will not arrive until roughly a year after the floods took place .
<en> Romanians who receive this money will not be aware that they are being helped by the European Union .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( FI ) Mr President , I would like to thank all those who have provided feedback on my report .
<en> I would say , now that the European Union is a Community of 27 Member States and 480 million inhabitants , that management and administration need to be simplified and made more efficient .
<en> Activity Based Management and Budgeting clearly allow for that , with power and responsibility being divided at appropriate levels , to make for responsible management and the efficient implementation of programmes .
<en> Finally , I wish to thank all of you , and I especially want to wish Mrs Grybauskaitevery happiness and success in her future challenges .
<en> It has been a very great pleasure to work with you , and we have noted the excellent levels of cooperation there have been between Parliament and the Commission .
<en> Thank you and best wishes .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> - ( DE ) Madam President , I refer to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure and thank you for having given me the floor .
<en> I ask my fellow Members from the Federal Republic of Germany in particular for their indulgence of my having asked to speak now .
<en> At the beginning of this vote , Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen took the floor .
<en> Mr Le Pen repeated in his leave to speak that the existence of the gas chambers in Auschwitz was a detail of world history .
<en> With reference to Rule 146 of our Rules of Procedure , which describes how members of this House must behave here , I ask Parliament 's Bureau to check if such a statement is permissible in a chamber of deputies , which is bound by a spirit of reconciliation and understanding and respect for the victims , especially of Hitler 's Fascism .
<en> I would be grateful if Parliament 's Bureau could advise on the necessary measures .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> - ( FR ) Please , show a little respect for the victims who died at Auschwitz and elsewhere .
<en> We still have two minutes left .
<en> Show a little respect .
<en> All I wish to say is that I completely agree with Mr Schulz and that what we have heard today , in this House , is uncalled for .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> - ( FR ) Mrs Wallis , I find it extremely regrettable that you have given the floor to Mr Daul and Mr Schulz , but not to me .
<en> It is true that you testified in a report that you were the expert in interpreting the one-rule-for-one-and-one-rule-for-another Rules of Procedure .
<en> Therefore , just to follow on from what Mr Schulz said , I should like to propose that we rename the Winston Churchill building , since in his 12 volumes of memoirs dedicated to the history of the Second World War , Winston Churchill wrote not one line on the history of the gas chambers .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , we are on the verge of new relations between the European Union and the United States .
<en> We all know how badly those relations were damaged by eight years of George W. Bush in the White House .
<en> That is why so many Europeans were pleased to see the election of Barack Obama and his promise of approaching a number of areas in a fundamentally different way .
<en> Mr Millán Mon 's report brings up all these important issues .
<en> Examples of this include the joint approach on climate change and the financial and economic crisis .
<en> There are other examples , too , such as the need to follow a new strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp .
<en> That last issue , Guantánamo Bay , was one of the wrongs that badly damaged the moral authority of the United States around the world .
<en> The same applies to issues such as torture and rendition .
<en> President Obama intends to bring an end to such practices and that is something that my group , too , warmly welcomes .
<en> There is one other decision , perhaps one that is less obvious , but one that , in my eyes , is also shameful and that needs to be reversed , and reversed as soon as possible .
<en> What I am referring to is the refusal by the United States to cooperate with the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in The Hague .
<en> Worse still , the US Congress took revenge by passing the American Service-Members ' Protection Act just a month after the ICC came into being in July 2002 .
<en> What exactly does that Act state ?
<en> The Act prohibits US institutions and citizens from cooperating with , or passing information to , the ICC .
<en> It obliges Americans to obtain an international guarantee of immunity before participating in United Nations operations .
<en> In other words , it makes it impossible to prosecute them .
<en> Countries that are signed up to the ICC can be punished for it and the United States does punish them .
<en> Finally , there is the element that caused the most fuss in my own country , the Netherlands , which is the fact that the Act grants the US President all means necessary - the option of using all means necessary - to bring about the release of any US personnel being detained by the International Criminal Court .
<en> That is why we in the Netherlands know the Act as the ' Hague Invasion Act ' .
<en> We could make a lot of jokes about this , and indeed we have done , and quite rightly so .
<en> That can lead us to underestimate the significance of this all , however .
<en> This Act was an extremely antagonistic and very symbolic reaction on President Bush 's part to the advent of the ICC .
<en> What we need now is an equally symbolic but , I hope , very friendly reaction from President Obama .
<en> I urge him to revoke this Act and cooperate with the ICC , and I call on the Commission and the Council to also bring this issue to the President 's attention when they meet him next week .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I read the report with great interest and I can frankly state that it caused me a certain amount of confusion .
<en> The report is made up of 61 points and it is exhaustive but in my opinion very opaque .
<en> It completely loses or even fails to include issues which most affect ordinary people in the Czech Republic and in Europe .
<en> I can find no definite opinion on the current global economic crisis and the approach of the EU and the US .
<en> I can find no position on the war being waged very unsuccessfully by some EU states alongside the US in Afghanistan .
<en> The position taken in the report is unaccountably circumspect .
<en> What is meant by the call to ' come up with a new strategic concept ' ?
<en> The assertion that ' we welcome the appointment of Richard Holbrook as the sole special envoy to the Pakistan-Afghanistan region ' is wholly inappropriate in a report of this kind and is nothing more than a manifestation of back-scratching among the small group of politicians who made the decision to bomb Yugoslavia 10 years ago .
<en> There is also a complete lack here of a clear standpoint on the plan to construct elements of the US national anti-missile defence system in Central Europe , which by the way has become a bone of contention in international relations and is sparking off a militarisation programme in space .
<en> Even though the report contains a noticeable shift away from the policy of double standards in relation to Eastern Europe and includes greater emphasis on international law , overall the report looks like a defence document for EU High Representative Javier Solana .
<en> The job was well done and there is no need for fundamental changes .
<en> The document includes calls to set up two new combined EU-US bodies and a proposal on this .
<en> In my opinion literary creations of this sort should not be submitted to the European Parliament .
<en> Instead we need a resolution on how to proceed over the fundamental issues affecting the world today .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , I very much share the spirit that pervades Mr Millán Mon 's report in relation to the ultimate importance for the European Union of sound transatlantic relations .
<en> He is right to refer to truly shared political and social values .
<en> As well as this praise , I also have some critical comments to make .
<en> I think it is a shame that it is only in passing that the rapporteur recommends , in paragraph 35 , a common transatlantic approach to China .
<en> There are no specific proposals , and that during these times of global crisis and in the run-up to the G20 in London , where all eyes will be on the financial reserves and power of Beijing .
<en> True , in paragraph 47 the rapporteur does highlight common transatlantic trade interests , such as the enforcement of intellectual property rights .
<en> What of the common area of concern - China - Mr Millán Mon ?
<en> My second comment relates to the putting into perspective of multilateralism , an idea that has been professed so often in this House .
<en> It is only the United States , on the basis of its political will and military capability , that is willing and able to ensure global stability and security .
<en> Let us just do a quick comparison with Europe .
<en> Europe 's task is simply to support Washington in a responsible and dependable way .
<en> For me , that is just real transatlantic cooperation , as , while the United States does need Europe , we need to be aware that Europe needs the Americans much more than they need us .
<en> Let us take that point on board .
<sp>
<en> - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate Mr Millán Mon on a useful and inspirational report on the state of transatlantic relations .
<en> As there is no time here for a detailed analysis , I would like to make just a few comments .
<en> Firstly , the text of the resolution in point B should not state with such certainty that the Lisbon Treaty will come into force .
<en> We still do not know that .
<en> Secondly , in the sections which talk correctly about the need to reform the international financial system , the World Bank and the IMF , the requirement for reform and strict regulation of rating agencies is missing .
<en> These agencies gave banks and insurance companies the maximum positive rating of Triple A even at a time when they were full of toxic assets , de facto bankrupt and paying out billions to their managers .
<en> Thirdly , in point 24 a reference is made to the report from a US panel of 16 news agencies on global trends in the period to 2025 .
<en> I should point out that similar analyses have also been produced in Russia and China but the report does not take sufficient account of these reports .
<en> China should anyway receive more attention .
<en> I would like to point out that according to the Financial Times last week , the three biggest banks in the world , measured by market capitalisation , are Chinese .
<en> China 's GDP is catching up with that of the US .
<en> The EU should adapt its behaviour accordingly .
<en> Fourthly , in points 31 and 32 there is a series of precise plans concerning Russia .
<en> There is talk of the need for constructive cooperation , but already in point 33 the EU and the US are called on to develop a joint strategy in respect of six countries of the former Soviet Union where Russian is widely spoken and where there is also a Russian population .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , according to the report , this strategy is to be implemented without the Russian Federation .
<en> If so then I fear we are unfortunately not talking about constructive cooperation but about planting the seeds for a series of conflicts and I hope we do not want that .
<sp>
<en> - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union and its Member States and the United States of America are forces for freedom and democracy .
<en> They set greater store by values than almost anyone else in the community of states on this planet .
<en> The United States once again proved during the last elections that they have the capacity for renewal and rejuvenation in this process based on values and democracy .
<en> In this global order , as the credit crunch has again shown , it is paramount that we Europeans work more closely with the Americans and link our interests , because only then can we lay down standards and deepen relations between our states .
<en> That is why I consider the report by Millán Mon to be extremely important at this juncture .
<en> We must endeavour to push ahead with the Transatlantic Economic Council and apply a policy which removes non-tariff trade barriers , so that we can thus ensure that interests are linked , a transatlantic market is achieved and political relations are thereby also permanently deepened .
<en> We must acknowledge here that this will only happen if the parliaments are involved , because it is only through the parliaments that the majority of regulations can be suitably adapted , and that this process and the proposals in connection with the Transatlantic Legislators ' Dialogue and the Transatlantic Assembly are of paramount importance .
<en> Furthermore , it is of decisive importance that we are today developing long-term strategies , that we are in a position to make joint plans and that both sides know what our common interests will be in 10 or 20 years ' time , so that we can base our practical policy on them .
<en> I also believe that this will give the Czech Presidency a starting point for highlighting this at the meeting with the Americans on 5 April , so that we can achieve a stronger link in the common interest .
<en> One final comment : all this will only work if the European Union is a stronger and more creditable partner , if it has something like the Treaty of Lisbon and acquires freedom of action in foreign policy .
<en> I should therefore also like to ask that we protect our interests at this hour and remember that we need to take these steps forward so that we can enter into true partnership with the United States of America eye to eye .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is voting time .
<en> ( For details of the outcome of the votes : see Minutes )
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , just a short aside , as Members are still taking their seats .
<en> We changed the rules of procedure because too much time was being spent on fruitless debates , and we decided not to hold a debate on the Auken report .
<en> We have wasted a good half hour doing nothing , which we could have employed much better by debating a text that is of great importance to citizens .
<sp>
<en> Your comment will be passed on to the competent bodies .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) During the 22 years of its existence , the programme for distributing food to the most deprived people in the Community has contributed towards implementing two main aims of the common agricultural policy .
<en> It helps to stabilise markets by reducing intervention stocks and it secures necessary food supplies for the poorest inhabitants of the EU .
<en> I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Siekierski 's consultation report dealing with the new programme for providing food to the poorest people , as proposed by the Commission .
<en> In 2009 this scheme should include a sum of EUR 500 million , with additional resources from the Member States designated for cofinancing .
<en> Mr President , just as your own mother and father have been watching the vote today , we also have some visitors from the regions of Prešov and Nitra in Slovakia and I would like to welcome them to the Chamber of the European Parliament .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted in favour of Mr Czesław Siekierski 's report and our resolution on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
<en> The report and resolution are of great importance in the context of the financial crisis and economic recession .
<en> Growing poverty in the EU - when in some countries poverty affects around 20 % of the population - clearly shows that the need for food assistance is quite high .
<en> Under the present circumstances , I fully support the European Parliament 's position that the EU food distribution programme , which allocates nearly half a billion euros with the aim of diminishing malnutrition and poverty in the EU , should be fully funded by the Community .
<en> I would especially like to stress the importance of the Commission 's proposal to improve the structure for selecting products supplied under the programme .
<en> The food should be chosen by Member States ' authorities and distributed in cooperation with civil society partners .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , feeding the hungry is an essential duty and we have to find a way to see that no person , especially a child , goes to bed hungry .
<en> I abstained on this report , however , because I find changes in this scheme do not really make sense .
<en> To have a CAP policy buying in food from third countries - whose poor people are already hungry - to feed our poor , while other CAP policies prevent our farmers from growing enough food to feed the hungry of Europe , simply does not make sense .
<en> We need to feed the poor , especially in this economic crisis , and I will be advocating changes to the scheme that will achieve this end .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , I voted against the three alternative resolutions , as I take the view that counterfeit goods constitute a serious problem and that we must endeavour to afford the European public the best possible protection against the import of such goods .
<en> This is to say nothing of the economic implications of counterfeit goods .
<en> European customs inspectors must indeed have the right to monitor ships from Indian ports destined for the European Union - by which I mean that this monitoring must take place in Indian ports .
<en> I also find it regrettable that , when the serious terrorist attacks that have taken place are mentioned in this House , the phrase used is ' political groups ' , when everyone knows that the groups concerned are Islamist groups .
<sp>
<en> I believe that Mr Tannock wished to speak .
<en> Let me just remind you of the rule .
<en> It is not the same as under the ' catch-the-eye ' procedure .
<en> You have to register before the explanations of vote begin , but I can be flexible .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , when the European Union is , at times , seen as over-keen on regulation and quite rightly criticised for this , this can be traced back , quite simply , to reports such as the one we are now discussing .
<en> As much as I support realistic measures to combat any form of discrimination , I must also criticise the points being discussed here , because they are simply not justified and will not have the desired effect .
<en> It is unacceptable that , as has already been mentioned , faith schools , for example , can be sued for rejecting teachers of a different faith , or no faith , or that insurance companies can be sued for undertaking a risk assessment if it results in a distinction on the basis of age or sex , or that there is a risk of absolutely all residential buildings having to be constructed to be barrier free .
<en> Yes , ladies and gentlemen , that is the direction we are heading in ; we will no longer actually be supporting disabled people , but making all housing unaffordable .
<en> Housing that nobody can afford , instead of assistance for disabled people - surely that cannot be what we are aiming for here .
<en> Then there is the criticism of the reversal of the burden of proof .
<en> If I think that , as an MEP with 25 applicants for an assistant 's position , I could have a case brought against me just for the appearance of discrimination or a feeling of discrimination , I will simply not be able to work any more , but spend all my time battling with the evidence I need to provide just because the feeling is there , even though I have not discriminated in any way .
<en> On top of that , there is the vagueness of many of the terms .
<en> Overall , this factsheet that has been published is a precursor to this directive , which starts to discuss whether we are still allowed to use ' Miss ' and ' Mrs ' , or whether we need to get rid of all words ending in ' man ' , such as statesman or sportsman , because it could all be discriminatory .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , some of what is being called for here is quite simply nonsense , and I will therefore be voting against the report .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , first of all I wish to thank our rapporteur , in particular for the work she has done and the result that has finally been achieved .
<en> Article 13 of the Treaty is our cornerstone , and I must emphasise that Member States can guarantee a higher level of protection .
<en> It is only a matter of minimum standards and , let us be clear about this , it is not possible to lower the current level of protection in individual Member States on the basis of this new directive .
<en> This is because , to be even more precise , some Member States have a very high level of protection ; such cases do exist .
<en> Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental right for everyone living in the European Union .
<en> However , whether it is due to a person 's appearance or simply their surname , we realise that discrimination does all too often exist .
<en> As regards people with disabilities , we must ensure that they are no longer discriminated against for using a wheelchair , because access to many places is all too often difficult .
<en> Improving European legislation is a prerequisite for combating discrimination - I repeat , it is a prerequisite .
<en> We need this legislation .
<en> From a very young age our children suffer discrimination that traumatises them , and they carry the burden of this discrimination for the rest of their lives .
<en> I must draw your attention in particular to multiple discrimination .
<en> The Commission omitted to include this in its proposal .
<en> We therefore propose a precise definition of these types of discrimination .
<en> It is absolutely essential that we strengthen legislation in order to make equal treatment effective whatever the differences .
<en> In this respect we ask for Member States to take measures to promote equal treatment and equal opportunities regardless of religion , disability , age or sexual orientation .
<en> In conclusion , I must add that we hope that , for 2010 , there will be a Commission proposal putting gender discrimination on the same footing , as this would put an end to any hierarchy of rights .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , like those who have spoken before me , I would like first of all to thank our two rapporteurs , Mrs Buitenweg and Mrs Lynne , for the outstanding work that they have done in what was , I would point out , a context of enhanced cooperation .
<en> Although I personally feel very much in line with the overall position defended by Mrs Lynne , I want to applaud the intelligence , openness and conciliatory spirit shown by Mrs Buitenweg throughout the discussion in our committee in order to try to end up with a report that is balanced and that would be supported by a large parliamentary majority .
<en> I hope she will be successful and that the more radical elements , on one side , I think , and sometimes on the other , will not succeed in affecting the vote .
<en> In this respect - and let me point out that I am not known as a left-wing fanatic - I have to say that I am surprised and dismayed by the amendment tabled by our fellow Member , Mr Weber , whom I respect , and several others .
<en> Mr Weber , I listened to your speech , and none of the arguments you used seemed to me to have any intellectual basis .
<en> You have stated fantasies , you have not stated reasons .
<en> If one reads the justification for your amendment , one can only be dismayed by its weakness : refusing to combat discrimination because of fear of excessive bureaucracy .
<en> When you try to turn this proposal into a conflict between left and right , you are wrong .
<en> Combating discrimination is not a matter of right or left , it is a matter of humanism and of respect for fundamental rights .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> That is why tomorrow , I hope and believe , you will be defeated .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , any initiative aimed at combating discrimination of any kind must be supported .
<en> Recent statistics show that in Europe , where society is so advanced , a minority of citizens say they have suffered discrimination .
<en> No one , therefore , can remain indifferent .
<en> However , the concept itself remains so wide and abstract that some clarification would be desirable .
<en> Without prejudice to fundamental human rights , which remain unquestionable , we cannot fail to recognise the sovereignty of each Member State to legislate in line with age-old traditions , civilisations and cultures .
<en> Intervention of this kind is almost always a case of safeguarding a population 's identity .
<en> Let me give an example relating to sexual orientation : it is my personal opinion , but I believe that human dignity must be guaranteed irrespective of sexual preference .
<en> Homosexuality is a choice that pertains to the private sphere and must under no circumstance be punished , but nor must it be protected .
<en> Freedom of opinion : where does protection against direct and indirect discrimination begin , and where does it end ?
<en> Freedom of religion : at my niece 's school , for the first time this year , there was no nativity play .
<en> The head teacher banned it because there were children of other religious faiths present .
<en> In my view , since the nativity play is a demonstration of culture more than faith , in order to prevent one form of discrimination , another was created .
<en> Having respect for other people 's religion does not mean , Mr President , that we should be ashamed of our own !
<en> That is why - I shall finish here - our fear is that this proposal for a directive tends towards unnecessary reverse extremism , and the cure could prove worse than the original problem .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this directive finally closes the gaps in anti-discrimination law , and allows the European Union to meet its international obligations to protect human rights , as well as its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , your arguments against the directive are populist and misleading .
<en> What right do you have to deny people with disabilities unrestricted access to education , or older people equal treatment regarding insurance and financial services ?
<en> What concept do you have of humanity ?
<en> Unrestricted participation in society is a human right , and for that reason we will fight for this directive and for equal opportunities for all .
<en> In my view , it is totally inhumane to require victims of discrimination to provide proof of the discrimination .
<en> If you , ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE Group , delete the shift in the burden of proof , you will be putting at risk the basic right of some groups to protection of their human dignity , and we find that unacceptable .
<en> We want equality for all in protection against discrimination , and we Greens will fight for that .
<en> We will not allow human rights to become a plaything for populist scaremongering .
<en> I can predict right now that you will lose tomorrow ; the majority of this House will vote in favour of the human right of protection from discrimination .
<en> Of that I am certain .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there are many ways of tackling the lasting effects of the unforeseen financial and economic crisis .
<en> This revision package , this legislative measure within the European Economic Recovery Plan , was conceived as a good - albeit not quite sufficient - response to this temporary , though exceptionally critical , situation .
<en> It responds , amongst other things , to the request for greater simplification of procedures and increased flexibility in the application of the existing rules under the Structural Funds Regulation that has been repeatedly put forward by the European Parliament in recent years .
<en> I should like to emphasise that it is also to be welcomed that an amendment to Article 7 - ' Eligibility of Expenditure ' - is to enable EU Member States and regions to invest in energy-efficiency and renewable-energy measures in housing with the support of the EU Structural Funds , and that this measure is not only intended for low-income households .
<en> The relevant amendment rightly eliminates the reference to ' low-income households ' , therefore , and instead imposes a ceiling of 4 % of the total European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) allocation for each Member State for such expenditure .
<en> This is just one of the many improvements proposed .
<en> In short , bringing this overall package to fruition would accelerate expenditure and thus make available further liquidity from the ERDF , European Social Fund ( ESF ) , Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds for the implementation of the necessary objectives , and would simplify rules allowing for a speedy implementation of programmes .
<en> In my opinion , this represents an effective , albeit as yet insufficient , contribution to dealing with the current crisis .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , the European Union is faced with a widespread crisis whose effects are currently impossible to anticipate .
<en> We have noted a reduction in the pace of growth , increased budget deficits and a dramatic increase in unemployment .
<en> European cohesion policy with a budget of EUR 347 billion for the years 2007-2013 seems to be one of the most effective instruments with which to stimulate investment again and provide additional public funding for national economies .
<en> The Commission has already adopted a series of measures aimed at introducing changes to the existing package of regulations concerning the Structural Funds .
<en> The changes are aimed at accelerating expenditure , increasing liquidity in relation to the implementation of projects and simplifying measures facilitating swift implementation of projects in the regions .
<en> The main areas of action concern increasing support from the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) and simplifying eligibility of expenditure .
<en> Lump sum payments and speeding up expenditure on large projects are also advocated .
<en> I welcome the swift action taken by the European Commission and the proposed legislative changes .
<en> A further important change has so far been overlooked and is called for , however .
<en> That would be to create a management and control system guaranteeing genuine liquidity across the European Union 's entire economic system .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Commission proposal has opened the opportunity for all Member States to invest Structural Fund resources in converting and repairing tower blocks and other buildings .
<en> This is particularly important for the Czech Republic because up to 26 % of Czech citizens live in aging tower blocks .
<en> If the proposal is passed tomorrow and also formally approved by the Council of Ministers in April , it will open up the possibility of investing a further CZK 16 billion in heating systems for flats and houses , and not only in the Czech Republic .
<en> I also personally welcome the elimination of the requirement to use the funds only for low-income households , which I consider problematic because internal domestic rules define these in different ways .
<en> In my opinion the Member States should have the opportunity to decide which categories of building are eligible for financing in accordance with their rules and to determine their own criteria according to their needs .
<en> We must enable better quality and cheaper housing for everyone , not just for those living in social housing .
<en> It is regrettable that it took the financial crisis to push us into supporting more investment in housing and the introduction of these measures throughout the EU .
<en> However , I wholeheartedly welcome this decision , because people have to spend their money very carefully today and in this way we will help them to save on their heating and hot water bills , and thus to reduce the cost of housing .
<en> According to an estimate from the CECODHAS organisation , European households can save an average of EUR 450 a year on these expenses , and that is tangible assistance .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the good work that they have done on these reports , which I commend to the House .
<en> I think this support should be very warmly welcomed .
<en> If Member States take this opportunity to use up the 4 % of European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) funding to facilitate investment in energy efficiency in the housing sector , this will make a positive contribution both to our economies and to the environment .
<en> It is good to see a proposal such as this , which tackles problems of the economic crisis and the environment simultaneously , coming from the Commission .
<en> The report is especially good news for many of the old Member States , and I am glad to see that old EU Member States will now be allowed to utilise a proportion of ERDF funds for interventions which promote energy efficiency in the housing sector .
<en> I am glad to see that the criteria for eligibility have been widened and will not be limited to low-income housing .
<en> However , we must also be aware that this does not represent any increase in funding .
<en> It is now up to the national and regional authorities to make use of this opportunity to redirect the percentage of their ERDF funds for funding towards these projects .
<en> This may entail reprioritising parts of their operational programmes .
<en> I feel that , in the long run , this will be well worth it .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , these measures from the Commission appear to be sound , more or less .
<en> Directly awarding contracts to the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund seems a good idea , as does simplifying procedures and speeding up payments .
<en> However , above all there is one fundamental recommendation : national and regional transparency regarding the use of funds , which is lacking in some cases , in my opinion .
<en> Checks should be carried out promptly , just as payments should be made promptly .
<en> In Italy , in certain regions , such as Lazio , farmers ' funds are paid out months or , in some cases , years after being transferred from the European Union , and I do not have time now to give other examples .
<en> Let us therefore ease the crisis by considering not only different kinds of intervention , but also the effective , timely and efficient use of funds .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , the Bureau of this Parliament officially informed us of the fact that MEPs ' attendances in committee and plenary sessions were to be made public on the European Parliament website .
<en> This was , incidentally , a move in response to a specific vote taken by this Parliament during its January session , when we voted for this , that is , for this information to be made public .
<en> So , Mr President , I have a request for you : since the Bureau is likely to hold only one or two more meetings at most in due course , to ensure that the will of this Parliament is respected , I formally request that you undertake to confirm that both this will and the vote taken by this House will be respected .
<en> I would not like to think that entirely bureaucratic reasons have prevented this requirement for transparency from being observed , because we made a commitment to the European electorate and public too .
<sp>
<en> Thank you very much .
<en> Parliament 's will is always decisive .
<en> We will consider what you had to say in the next meeting of the Bureau .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , a law on women 's rights which , according to the Afghan senator Humeira Namati , is worse than that which was in force at the time of the Taliban , has been signed by President Hamid Karzai .
<en> This text makes it legal for a husband to rape his wife and forbids women from going out , working or visiting the doctor without the husband 's permission .
<en> In addition , the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather .
<en> I call on you , Mr President , immediately to take all the measures necessary to express the total disapproval of our Parliament and to include this item under urgent business for our next session .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mrs Záborská .
<en> We will take care of this matter .

<sp>
<en> The next item is the report by Mrs Ludford , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the problem of profiling , notably on the basis of ethnicity and race , in counter-terrorism , law enforcement , immigration , customs and border control .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - Madam President , over the past decade , laws and practices have been introduced enabling the retention and exchange of huge volumes of personal data .
<en> Currently the EU itself is proposing a number of measures that facilitate profiling , a technique of pulling together data from various sources in order to make a sort of template against which are identified those people whose characteristics , behaviour or associates seem suspicious and who merit further screening as likely perpetrators of crime or terrorism .
<en> There has also been a move in policing towards a predictive and preventive approach which , while not without value in some circumstances , can lead to repressive measures against innocent people based on stereotyping , often on the basis of race or even religion .
<en> The reason I am concerned about profiling and data-mining is because they depart from the general rule that law-enforcement decisions should be based on an individual 's personal conduct .
<en> The danger exists that an innocent person may be subject to arbitrary stops , interrogations or travel disruption .
<en> Then , if that flagging of them as a person of interest is not promptly removed , longer-term restrictions could follow , such as refusal of visas and entry , bans on employment or even arrest and detention .
<en> In a world of increasing international exchange of data , the identification of someone as a person of security or policing interest , if not corrected , could have not only inconvenient or expensive but indeed appalling consequences .
<en> One need only remember that Canadian torture flight victim , Maher Arrar - on whose horrendous experience the film ' Rendition ' was based - was picked up due to profiling based on people his brother happened to know ; having done nothing himself to merit suspicion , he nonetheless spent seven months in a Syrian torture dungeon .
<en> The report I am presenting to you has benefited greatly from the considerable input of the shadow rapporteurs , whom I warmly thank .
<en> It outlines human rights , data protection and non-discrimination standards in an attempt to uphold two basic principles for any profiling exercise to meet : that repressive consequences should be based on individual behaviour , and that the principle of equality under the law should be upheld .
<en> Not all profiling raises legal objections .
<en> We are all familiar with thrillers where the psychologist is called in to draw up a criminal profile of the murder suspect ; and if a witness gives a clear description , a profile - of a bank robber , let us say : white , male and 30 - it would be nonsense to arrest someone who was Asian , female and about 50 .
<en> The most obvious risk of profiling is on the basis of ethnicity or race .
<en> If used by police officers as the only basis of deciding whom to stop , search or arrest , it is lazy , misguiding stereotyping , which amounts to illegal discrimination against minorities .
<en> There is much concern about the victimisation of Roma people in this way .
<en> In my own city , London , the impact on young black men has led to tougher guidelines and safeguards - none of which , it must be stressed , should impede the intelligence-led investigation of crime .
<en> Besides concerns regarding legitimacy , I strongly question the effectiveness of profiling .
<en> To keep looking for suspicious people on the basis of looks or behaviour can distract from the search for those who are really dangerous .
<en> There is also the risk of the real criminals adapting to the profile by using innocent-looking people as drug mules or suicide bombers or by changing travel routes away from those monitored .
<en> Counterterrorism efforts focus the spotlight on Asians , especially those of Pakistani origin .
<en> Thirty-two per cent of British Muslims report being subject to discrimination at airports .
<en> There is a great risk of alienating these people , who may then end up not cooperating with the police , ultimately hindering security .
<en> This report therefore asks for European or national legislation on profiling to be brought in compliance with existing European law and international treaties .
<en> If possible , all safeguards for profiling should be drawn together in a single legal instrument .
<en> Besides the legal assessment , further studies should be conducted into the proportionality and effectiveness of profiling .
<en> The Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Data Protection Supervisor , in their respective capacities , should play a key role in those studies .
<en> Finally , if profiling is to be used legally and fairly as a means of contributing to the maintenance of security , a coherent and just legal framework must be established .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , on behalf of the Commission I would like to welcome this initiative by Parliament to bring the issue of profiling , notably on the basis of ethnicity and race , in counterterrorism , law enforcement , immigration , customs and border control , to the centre of attention at European level .
<en> The Ludford report represents a very good platform that contributes further to this issue by launching a broad discussion and suggesting how to tackle this problem .
<en> I want to underline that already existing data protection legislation ensures a high level of protection of personal data - including sensitive data such as information on ethnicity or race - and applies regardless of the technology used .
<en> Therefore , it is obvious that general data protection principles apply to profiling as one of the ways of data processing as well .
<en> The Commission strongly believes that unjustified or unnecessary ethnic profiling is an unfair and prohibited practice , even when this is done for law-enforcement purposes or in connection with immigration , customs and border control , and is contrary to the fundamental values of the European Union .
<en> Under important instruments proposed by the Commission - like the Schengen Border Code , Eurodac , SIS , VIS - the use of unjustified ethnic profiling techniques is not authorised .
<en> For example , as regards border controls , the provisions of Article 6 of the Schengen Borders Code require that border guards execute checks with no discrimination against travellers on grounds of racial or ethnic origin , religion or belief .
<en> I would also like to mention the activities of the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field .
<en> The Agency is about to present a good practices handbook for combating and preventing ethnic profiling .
<en> The Commission supports the inclusion in the 2010 work programme of the agency of joint training with FRONTEX , where the said handbook could be used .
<en> The Commission also supports the inclusion in the 2010 work programme of the agency of a project on implementing Article 6 of the Schengen Border Code that aims at collecting data .
<en> Finally , the Commission welcomes the minorities and discrimination survey that was presented yesterday .
<en> The sections on law enforcement and border control provide us with further and recent data on experiences of ethnic profiling .
<en> The Commission will , of course , carefully study the results of the Minorities and Discrimination Survey , which will be published chapter by chapter through the year .
<en> But already now we can conclude that racism and xenophobia are still persistent phenomena in the European Union and that they affect the lives of members of ethnic minorities .
<en> The Commission agrees with the draft report that processing of data for statistical purposes , including ethnicity , race or origin , could be used to identify indirect discrimination or unjustified law enforcement practices .
<en> However , this angle has to be properly assessed .
<en> Therefore , the Commission is looking into the opportunity to ask the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party to prepare an opinion on the processing of personal data for statistical purposes , including ethnicity , race or origin .
<en> The Commission is also following closely the activities of the Council of Europe on the draft Recommendation on Profiling .
<en> The Commission is about to launch a request to the Council for a mandate to be authorised to negotiate this draft recommendation .
<en> As regards the need for a legal framework to define profiling , the Commission believes that the relevant EU legislation on border management and data protection is adequate to protect fundamental rights .
<en> Indeed , it requires that any processing activity has to be grounded on a specific , recognised legal basis and respect particularly the principles of necessity , proportionality , purpose limitation and accuracy .
<en> It is subject to supervision by independent public authorities .
<en> Currently the framework also contains strict rules relating to the processing of sensitive personal data or automated decisions .
<en> All these principles also apply to profiling as one of the ways of performing processing of personal data .
<en> The Commission is committed - and I am personally committed - to fighting racism and xenophobia to the full extent of the powers conferred by the Treaties , and this includes cases where racism comes from public authorities .
<en> The Commission is determined to reinforce our policy to fight racism and xenophobia in the Stockholm context , which should include tackling the issue of ethnic profiling .
<en> Again , on behalf of the Commission , I very much welcome the draft report , and I look forward to its adoption in plenary tomorrow .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , as Socialists we fully support this report and contributed to it because we believe it is the first time in this Parliament that the political , legal and moral debate surrounding ethnic profiling and its effects on ordinary people has been raised properly .
<en> We believe that predictive profiling and data mining are issues which have long been unexamined and I very much welcome the Commission 's positive approach to both recognising this issue and understanding the possible indirect discrimination that can be caused by ethnic profiling .
<en> The Socialists hope that if this report is adopted tomorrow and following the upcoming Council of Europe recommendation on profiling , there will be sufficient political impetus to address this issue at the highest levels .
<en> Why ?
<en> For my constituency of London and for myself personally , I can say that I know what ethnic profiling means .
<en> It means being stopped and searched regularly because of how you look , rather than being stopped and searched because of proper intelligence , proper policing , with proper procedures put into place .
<en> This kind of profiling is a waste of resources .
<en> It does not catch terrorists ; it does not catch criminals .
<en> What it does is target indirectly or directly those who are vulnerable , who have an ethnic background which is just the wrong background
<en> This can lead - and I think people should understand this - to strip searches and other abuses which we have seen .
<en> This report is an important step forward in protecting people against something which so far has been unexamined , but I am glad that Sarah Ludford had now raised it in Parliament and we will fully support this report tomorrow .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank Sarah Ludford for her report .
<en> Kathalijne Buitenweg cannot be here , but I will represent her views .
<en> I must begin by asking : what is a terrorist ?
<en> What kind of feeling do terrorists create ?
<en> They create insecurity .
<en> Terrorists also make everyone vulnerable , and prevent them from pursuing their life as they want to .
<en> Then you look at the anti-terror legislation with profiling and you see it creates insecurity and it creates problems for people living their daily lives .
<en> You cannot combat terrorism with anti-terror laws that create the same feelings of insecurity .
<en> I think the European Court has been very clear on this , saying that this should be banned .
<en> We can see that it is neither efficient nor legal .
<en> The Carter Center in the US has showed it was not efficient .
<en> The German surveillance scheme on 18-40-year-old Muslim men in Germany was not efficient .
<en> It does not work , and I very much hope that we can take away the last exemptions allowing airports and harbours and so on to use these inefficient methods that make people feel bad .
<en> And how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people leave CDs with 20 million people 's data on them lying in cafés , and when we know how easy it is to hack into computers ?
<en> I did it myself as a kid actually .
<en> So I think this report is important .
<en> The Council needs to adapt its logic and spend the resources efficiently , targeting specific individuals and focusing the time on them instead of going for ethnic registration , which is in complete violation of any human rights standards .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , I should like to ask the services to take into account that the Portuguese version is authentic for all amendments .
<2en> Secondly , I should like to ask that the order of voting be changed , and that Committee Amendment 43 be voted on before Amendment 83 for the sake of coherence .
<2en> Finally , I would point out that this directive that we are going to amend is 17 years old and is clearly out of date .
<2en> The revised directive will not enter into force before the end of the next legislative term .
<2en> In other words , we are legislating for the future , not for today .
<2en> In particular , we are legislating for the good of the citizens , thereby giving them more reasons to vote in the June elections .
<2en> I will therefore end by asking my fellow Members to support my report .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , as things stand at present , there are 89 amendments to this report .
<en> It is totally chaotic , and the vote that we are going to take will not allow us to hold a truly objective debate with the Council and the Commission .
<en> These 89 amendments are all totally at odds with each other .
<en> I propose we refer this report back to committee because , as Mrs Estrela said , we have plenty of time to do so .
<en> ( Loud applause )
<sp>
<en> Ms Lulling , could you kindly confirm to me whether or not you make that request on behalf of your political group ?
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Yes , Madam President , I never make anything not on behalf of my political group !
<en> ( Laughter and applause )
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Madam President , it does not make sense to refer this report , or this proposal , back to committee , because it was discussed with all the groups .
<en> It is presumably supported by a majority in this House .
<en> It was also discussed with the Commission and with the Council .
<en> Naturally , people have different opinions .
<en> We know that , regrettably , the Council under the Czech Presidency has adopted a very conservative attitude to the promotion of gender equality .
<en> I therefore call on the House to vote for the proposals and to support my report , because it will give the citizens more reasons to go out and vote in the European elections .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am partly in agreement with the three reports we are discussing .
<en> Mr Zwiefka 's report is easier to swallow because it makes the procedure for negotiating and concluding bilateral agreements on sectoral aspects between Member States and non-EU countries homogeneous and , all things considered , more transparent .
<en> As for Mr Deprez 's report , I essentially agree with the second half , when it refers to the necessary consistency required of the Commission if we intend to develop a Community policy concerning external relations in the judicial co-operation sector .
<en> However , when it comes the possibility of the Member States concluding the agreements themselves , as a nationalist I am of course pleased with this and hope that it is not a process that is necessarily limited in scope and time .
<en> Lastly , I must honestly say that I have some doubts about Mrs Pagano 's European Parliament recommendation .
<en> I am grateful to her for having pointed out and supported the use of e-justice , all the more so because I was responsible for drawing up the report , and I still owe a debt of gratitude to those who co-operated to ensure its success .
<en> However , my awareness of subjects concerning the fundamental freedoms of victims , and also of suspects and defendants , as well as the need to implement the judicial training of judges and operators , lead me to remark that we still have a long way to go in this area - at least we certainly do in Italy .
<en> Furthermore , when it comes to the European arrest warrant , frankly my doubts turn into outright opposition .
<en> I nevertheless thank the rapporteurs for having worked on these subjects with skill and precision .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the three rapporteurs , Mr Zwiefka , Mr Deprez and Mrs Pagano .
<en> Ι should like in particular to congratulate Mrs Pagano on her report as shadow rapporteur and to thank her for her kind words and , at the same time , to thank her for working in close cooperation with me on the report .
<en> I should also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that , according to the Commissioner , the Commission accepts almost all the points included in this report .
<en> As such , I fully endorse Mrs Pagano 's report and , of course , everything she said in the House today .
<en> Commissioner , 10 years have passed since the European Council announced at Tampere that it had adopted the strategic objective of creating an area of freedom , justice and security in the European Union , 10 years since the announcement that the cornerstone of judicial cooperation is mutual recognition of and trust in decisions by supreme courts .
<en> I must say that little has been done in this direction .
<en> Thus , whereas in the case of civil law , several issues have been promoted , in the case of criminal law , things have remained almost at a standstill .
<en> We hope that , with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon , there will be greater progress in this direction .
<en> Commissioner , even this proposal on minimum procedural safeguards has not been pushed forward and our request - and these words are also directed at the Council - is that you push it forward .
<en> I shall close by saying that there are , of course , differences between judicial systems , but there is also room for convergence .
<en> That is why the recommendation on the creation of a committee of wise persons to study all the differences and similarities in the law needs to be implemented , so that we have specific expert recommendations on the convergence of our laws and mutual trust in judicial systems .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , in the field of civil justice , apart from the acquis communautaire , there are a number of bilateral agreements which were concluded by Member States with third countries .
<en> Pursuant to Article 307 of the EC Treaty , Member States need to eliminate all provisions which may be present in agreements of this kind and which are incompatible with the acquis .
<en> In its Opinion 1 / 03 of February 2006 , the Court of Justice held that the Community has acquired exclusive competence to conclude international agreements with third countries on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters .
<en> The question then arises as to whether all existing or proposed bilateral agreements with these countries and on these matters should be replaced by Community agreements .
<en> Or should Member States remain authorised to conclude these agreements where there is no Community interest involved ?
<en> This procedure , which is an exception to the rule , must , however , be subject to very specifically stated conditions relating to the scope of the mechanism and the time when it is in force .
<en> It is , therefore , important that the Commission establish a strategy and set priorities , bearing in mind the development of Community policy concerning external relations in the area of judicial cooperation on civil and commercial matters .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I will be brief because I can only express the satisfaction I feel about the way in which Parliament has helped to shed light on this area of law , justice , security and freedom that we wish to build in the Union ; I welcome all that has been said , especially on the principle of mutual recognition , which itself brings us back to mutual trust between judges .
<2en> It is true , as has been explained very well , that there is scope for convergence of the judicial systems , which , in particular , should be formalised through minimum procedures in the case of criminal proceedings .
<2en> I really believe that all this is paving the way for a good Stockholm Programme , and I would like to thank Parliament for that .
<2en> As for the rest , I can confirm that it will indeed be possible to find an institutional framework for bilateral agreements , but that the Community and the Commission must have exclusive competence .
<2en> That is what I am able to say .
<2en> I do not wish to prolong the debate .
<2en> There are still many things to be said .
<2en> Above all I am grateful to Parliament , and I must say - as I will not get to speak again - that I will have been greatly enriched by my experience as commissioner , insofar as I really feel that a good alliance between the Commission and the European Parliament can often - I apologise to the Presidency for pointing this out , but it is the truth - highlight and promote the general European interest .
<2en> However , I am of course grateful to the Presidency for having given its support .
<2en> There must be synergy between the three institutions ; however , my thanks go to the European Parliament which , again this evening , has just given us a very good report .
<2en> Thank you , Mrs Pagano .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , this debate has been extremely interesting , and it seems that we are very close to reaching a first-reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law .
<en> May I say there is not just agreement , but a fair and well-balanced agreement .
<en> This is , I think , an excellent illustration of the good cooperation between Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
<en> I am convinced that Member States will make good use of the procedure established by both the future regulations , and it will allow them to provide an adequate legal framework for their relations with certain third countries with which they have specific ties .
<en> As I stressed earlier , the first-reading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law has an impact on the other proposal in the area of family law , given that the two texts are largely identical .
<en> Through the first-reading agreement we have , therefore , also paved the way for an early adoption of the other proposal .
<en> This is indeed a desirable development .
<en> A great many Member States have a huge interest in being able to conclude agreements with third countries on family law matters , such as custody of children , access rights and maintenance obligations due to , for instance , specific historical or social ties with those countries .
<en> Finally , on behalf of the Council , I would like to thank Parliament for its inspiring recommendations on the development of EU criminal justice , which are the subject of the report by Mrs Maria Grazia Pagano .
<en> I would like to thank Parliament for this fruitful debate and for the excellent outcome .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The past 12 months have seen the deterioration of the dairy market with prices of milk falling below 21 cents per litre and leaving many farmers with no alternative but to sell dairy products at a loss .
<en> This is an extremely serious situation and therefore I have voted in favour of this resolution .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DA ) We have voted against the proposals for increased agricultural aid to the dairy farming sector .
<en> Our group votes consistently in favour of reducing agricultural aid and continuing to reform the EU 's agricultural policy .
<en> In connection with the decision in this regard , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament voted against Amendments 16 , 17 and 19 , because , despite having a favourable content , these amendments were not relevant to the discussion in question .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the motion for a joint resolution on the crisis in the dairy farming sector since I believe urgent measures are needed to resolve the serious crisis that the sector is experiencing , particularly by stimulating demand so as to restore market balance .
<2en> It is regrettable , however , that the compromise reached in Parliament does not include the temporary suspension of quota increases or other measures to reduce production , which would be very important in helping European farmers to face this crisis .
<sp>
<2en> The serious crisis affecting the dairy farming sector makes it urgent to adopt more effective measures for supporting producers and to consider the usefulness of eliminating milk quotas in 2015 .
<2en> Stabilisation of the milk and dairy market will not be achieved just through one or two odd measures , such as not increasing quotas , designed to mitigate the immediate , temporary effects of the crisis .
<2en> On the contrary , medium- to long-term solutions will have to be considered , and the reasons why this market is not working properly must be assessed , together with the best ways to maintain sustainable production , not forgetting the consumers ' right to a fair price .
<2en> In this respect , I must point out the particularly fragile competitive status of those outermost regions that depend heavily on dairy production , such as the Azores .
<2en> I regret a certain insensitivity on the part of the European Commission and , at a national level , the poor management of this process by the Portuguese Government .
<2en> Our leaders ' ability to take action and support national interests is particularly important in times of crisis .
<2en> Regrettably , that has not been the case .
<2en> On the positive side , I note the success of the amendments of which I am a co-author , which support an increase in de minimis payments .
<2en> It is not an ideal solution , but it helps .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting in favour of this resolution , although it does not go far enough .
<2en> To stabilise prices now , the bonus of 2 % of the annual increase beyond the quota must be withdrawn urgently .
<2en> The milk quota system will still need to continue after 2015 or be replaced with another regulatory mechanism .
<2en> It is vital to adjust milk production to European domestic demand so as to guarantee producers a fair price .
<2en> Market transparency is essential , and in that respect I suggest setting up a European observatory to help monitor and regulate the market from production to distribution .

<2en> The new legislative framework on the European Citizens ' Initiative is undoubtedly welcome .
<2en> There had long been a case for citizens to have access to such an instrument .
<2en> On the other hand , I share the sentiments of those who have taken the floor today and called for the regulations which will be used as the basis for implementing the citizens ' initiative to be simple , accessible , easy to understand and involve as little red tape as possible .
<2en> This is the only way that the citizens ' initiative will actually manage to become a proper instrument available to Europeans , which they can use to make their voice heard .
<2en> This is the only way that the EU will successfully move closer to its citizens and become more democratic .
<sp>
<2en> The Treaty of Lisbon gives the citizens of the European Union the right to propose a legislative initiative .
<2en> This is one of the most important steps in the building of civil democracy and direct inclusion of the citizens in the EU decision-making process .
<2en> The European Citizens ' Initiative can contribute to a reduction in the gap between the institutions and the citizens , and can support the development of European civil society .
<2en> Therefore , rapid adoption of a regulation to govern the process , conditions and procedures for presentation of such an initiative is essential .
<2en> The citizens of the European Union eagerly await this .
<2en> The European Citizens ' Initiative is mainly about greater involvement of the citizens in creating European law .
<2en> Therefore , I would like to raise the matter of digital signatures in the citizens ' initiative , as an additional channel for attracting interest in European politics .
<2en> Since we can already vote via the Internet and carry out banking operations online , we are certainly able to develop a secure system which would allow us to identify digital signatures .
<2en> Transparency of procedures is also important .
<2en> The organisers of initiatives must be publicly responsible for transparency concerning the financing of the campaign to collect signatures .
<2en> Even the establishment of clear criteria for the course of such a campaign does not ensure protection from possible abuses of this instrument by Eurosceptics , for whom collecting a million signatures , with the use of significant financial resources , may not constitute a major problem , as the last European Parliament election campaign showed .
<2en> One solution could be to oblige initiators to maintain an Internet site containing financial information , such as sources of income , expenses and financial reports .
<sp>
<2en> Today 's debate is another step on the road to establishing the final form of the European Citizens ' Initiative .
<2en> The idea to create a tool enabling the citizens to participate more fully in the democratic life of the Union was mooted as far back as 2005 after the unsuccessful constitutional referendums in France and the Netherlands .
<2en> Those votes reflected a noticeable lack of communication between the European Union and its citizens .
<2en> Even the recently published results of the social consultations , starting with the Green Paper on a European Citizens ' Initiative , show the low level of interest on the part of individual citizens .
<2en> The Commission received as few as 159 responses from individuals .
<2en> The citizens ' initiative makes it possible for us to change this situation and give a stronger voice to our citizens by giving them the right to call directly on the Commission to bring forward new policy initiatives .
<2en> To guarantee that the initiative does not become an instrument in a political game , we must not make demands of our citizens which are too strict .
<2en> However , we must make sure that guarantees against abuses are met .
<2en> It is important that the European Citizens ' Initiative be a truly supranational instrument which will be citizen-friendly and easy to use .
<2en> It should be simple , understandable and easily accessible .
<2en> If the draft of an initiative does not meet formal requirements , its idea should remain and be presented in the form of a petition .
<2en> In this way , the work put into its preparation and the effort invested will not be wasted .
<2en> Fulfilment of these conditions will allow Europeans , for the first time in the history of our integrated Europe , to have a real and direct influence on the creation of European policy .

<2en> I welcome the vote on the Cashman report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals : mid-term review in preparation of the UN high-level meeting in September 2010 .
<2en> It simply had to be adopted !
<2en> Only five years away from the 2015 deadline set for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , it offers a unique opportunity for the international community to redouble its efforts to achieve those goals .
<2en> The situation is critical and requires urgent action .
<2en> There must be renewed efforts to write off the debts of the least developed countries and to embark on a course that will reduce the burden of debt on developing countries .
<2en> I am also in favour of the introduction of enhanced measures to monitor fulfilment of the commitment made to devote 0.7 % of GNI to official development assistance ( ODA ) by 2015 .
<2en> Financing of the MDGs must begin at national level , and developing countries must generate and allocate own resources to achieve those goals , but the donor community must keep its promise to substantially increase its ODA .
<2en> The commitments made must absolutely be honoured at the meeting in September .
<sp>
<2en> Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is a fundamental commitment by the international community .
<2en> However , it has not provided itself with the resources to fulfil that commitment .
<2en> Two-thirds of the way through , it is clear that many least developed countries ( LDCs ) will be unable to achieve any of the goals of eradicating poverty , of providing access to education and health care , and that most developing countries will be far from achieving them too .
<2en> Europe is the world 's leading donor but , with 0.4 % of GNI , it cannot be content with falling so far short of the target of devoting 0.56 % to official development assistance ( ODA ) in 2010 , a target that it set itself .
<2en> The fact is , the aid requirements are greater than ever , especially in the areas of food security , the fight against climate change , education , health - in particular for HIV sufferers - and maternal and reproductive health .
<2en> With the Cashman report , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is calling for the European Council of 17 June to endorse the proposal for a 0.05 % tax on international financial transactions , which would yield EUR 10 billion , and to set itself the target of achieving 0.63 % of European GNI in 2012 , with a view to increasing it to 0.7 % .
<sp>
<2en> As shadow rapporteur on this report , I voted firmly in favour of this report whose objective is to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are successfully achieved .
<2en> I fully support the efforts of my fellow Members to ensure that the European Union 's voice on this issue is united and progressive .
<2en> However , I was unable to endorse the two amendments submitted , whose provisions I find unacceptable as a liberal .
<2en> Therefore , I voted against the calls for the EU unilaterally to introduce a tax on currency and derivatives transactions in order to fund global public goods , including the MDGs .
<2en> The European Union should not place an additional tax burden on its citizens , in particular taxes whose mechanisms and impact have not yet been fully examined .
<2en> I also do not agree that development aid measures should be legally binding .
<2en> It is important for the Member States to fulfil their obligations to increase the amount of Official Development Aid ( ODA ) , but the European Union should not legally penalise its Member States because of a partial failure to fulfil obligations in the changed context of the financial crisis .
<2en> Not all Member States were affected by the crisis in the same way and not all will be able to achieve the goal of 0.7 % .
<2en> The European Parliament should encourage them with softer and more acceptable means than strict legal measures .
<sp>
<2en> It is alarming that so many Members of this House voted against giving women in developing countries the right to control their own bodies and reproductive health by attempting to have paragraph 42 of the report deleted .
<2en> This is an indication of a very disturbing trend among opponents of abortion in Europe who are using the aid programme to make their views public .
<2en> The availability of family planning is an important factor in enabling women in developing countries to take control over their own lives and , as a result , to lift themselves out of poverty .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Cashman report because there is still a long way to go before we can achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
<2en> It is necessary to strengthen existing measures so that they can be achieved by 2015 , particularly through the implementation of the responsibilities assumed by the Member States on aid to developing countries .
<2en> I welcome the adoption of paragraph 42 , which ' calls on all the Member States and the Commission to reverse the worrying decline in funding for sexual and reproductive health and rights in developing countries , and to support policies on voluntary family planning , safe abortion , treatment of sexually transmitted infections and the provision of reproductive health supplies consisting of life-saving drugs and contraceptives , including condoms ' .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report by the Committee on Regional Development takes a realistic and very current approach to the situation that the Member States and their regions are experiencing , given the context of the economic and financial crisis ravaging Europe .
<2en> Since I am from Madeira , an outermost region classified as a region targeted by the Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective , the issue addressed here is deeply familiar and relevant to me , which is why I have decided to vote in favour of this report .
<2en> Objective 2 of the Community cohesion policy aims to boost the regions facing serious unemployment problems and which have structural difficulties that are exacerbated even more by the current crisis .
<2en> For regional policy and the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy to be fully realised , it is necessary to strengthen the competitiveness of the regions by developing employment and economic policies .
<2en> Only in this way will it be possible for Europe to achieve effective , smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
<2en> For these reasons , I support the rapporteur 's view , which proposes greater flexibility in allocating Community funds and aid so that the affected regions can benefit from modernisation and support that will translate into real development and , over time , will make way for a more sustainable economy .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Due to the lack of a single , effective mechanism for economic coordination and balanced growth within the European Union , cohesion policy is playing a leading role in helping us get back on our feet .
<en> In particular , Objective 2 of the Structural Funds has been - and remains - one of the most important pillars of cohesion policy , especially in the context of exiting the economic crisis .
<en> For countries like Lithuania , more flexible access to the EU regional funds would go a long way to help the recovery of areas worst hit by the crisis .
<en> This flexible funding could create new jobs and would have to include diverse areas : investment for infrastructure , support for small firms , professional training , and industrial and rural modernisation .
<en> It is important that these instruments are not solely used as fire-fighting interventions .
<en> Our efforts must also be focused on long-term restructuring outcomes and the transition to a more sustainable economy - flexibility is also crucial for long-term policy .
<en> Objective 2 and other cohesion policy branches can also help once again to narrow the gap between EU Member States .
<en> For Lithuania , it is particularly important to catch up where it left off before the financial tsunami hit , and to regain its hard-earned status as a ' Baltic Tiger ' .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I supported this resolution as EU regional funds are vital in helping those areas worst affected by the current economic crisis .
<en> Flexible access to these funds is necessary if regions are to benefit from investment in infrastructure and support for small businesses .
<en> I agree fully with the importance of improving aid to ' Objective 2 ' regions ; much progress has been made in these regions in recent years and we need to ensure that the present crisis does not hamper further advancements in these poor areas .
<en> Implementation of cohesion policy programmes should be sped up in order to help these regions at this time .
<en> It is also important to ensure that ' competitiveness ' remains post-2013 and is not removed from the area of regional policy .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the assessments and the recommendations made by the European Parliament in this document , which should aim to bring the bus transport sector up to the quality levels of the air and rail transport sectors , must be strongly supported .
<2en> Unfortunately the Council has instead weakened , if not abolished , both the Commission provisions and the majority of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading .
<sp>
<2en> This report aims to improve the rights of bus and coach passengers , an ambition which I welcomed by voting in favour .
<2en> I also took a position in favour of greater convenience in these modes of transport for disabled people and people with reduced mobility , as well as more guarantees for all passengers in case of accidents , and also in case of delay or cancellation .
<2en> However , it seemed preferable to me to abstain on Amendment 14 .
<2en> Although this allows for the possibility of Member States granting an exemption in the application of the regulation with regard to urban , suburban and regional transport services , I think that it does not go far enough , and that it imposes too many restrictions , particularly on assistance , which would affect small and medium-sized enterprises unfairly .
<2en> All of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
<2en> The important thing now is to come to an agreement with the Council of the European Union so that this regulation can come into force .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) In a world where 43 countries still maintain the death penalty , and where children are forced to watch public executions , Europe must continue to call for an end to this practice , which constitutes a cruel and unacceptable violation of the right to life .
<en> I voted for this resolution because I feel the EU should use diplomatic instruments to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty , applying pressure on government authorities to impose a moratorium on capital punishment , with a view to its complete abolition .
<en> The resolution urges the Council and the Commission to provide guidelines for an overall European policy to apply to the dozens of European citizens condemned to suffer the death penalty in third countries , and make information and legal assistance available , which I consider equally important .
<en> I also recognise the importance of approving World day against the death penalty and European day against the death penalty .
<sp>
<2en> The value of life and the multiple cases of judicial error that history has left us are more than enough reason for us to fight the death penalty .
<2en> Abolition of the death penalty throughout the world is one of the European Union 's priorities .
<2en> The European day against the death penalty has been established on 10 October each year .
<2en> We are strongly committed to working towards the abolition of the death penalty everywhere and are striving to achieve universal acceptance of this principle .
<2en> According to Amnesty International , there are still 58 countries in the world that have not abolished it , 18 of which carried out executions in 2009 .
<2en> China alone executed more people than all the other countries put together .
<2en> The only country in Europe that continues to apply the death penalty is Belarus .
<2en> The European Parliament was the first European institution to launch this campaign , in the early 1980s , and the EU is currently the main institutional actor in the fight against the death penalty , as well as the main source of funding for such efforts .
<2en> We must fight for the adoption of moratoria on executions until the death penalty is finally eradicated .
<sp>
<2en> One of the first measures adopted by the temporary authorities in Bucharest after the collapse of the Ceauşescu regime , in the wake of the popular uprisings in Timişoara and Bucharest , was to abolish the death penalty .
<2en> This was a gesture of healing , primarily to the political victims of the totalitarian regimes which dominated Romania from the 1930s .
<2en> I am recalling this event in recent European history because the European Parliament 's resolution on the World day against the death penalty is a response to an outmoded practice in the 21st century .
<2en> The death penalty is still part of the legislation in many countries , including some which actively promote civil rights and freedoms globally .
<2en> The death penalty does not only not act as a deterrent and reduce the level of crime , but it also raises the very real issue of possible miscarriages of justice , which would send innocent people to their death .
<2en> I regard the invitation from the European Union 's Member States to the countries which still use this punishment , calling on them to adopt a moratorium on carrying out the sentences , as one of the main plus points of this resolution .
<2en> This made me decide to vote in favour of its adoption .
<sp>
<2en> This year , 12 countries applied capital punishment , in spite of the condemnation levelled against this inhumane punishment by most countries in the world and international institutions , including the United Nations .
<2en> I believe that the pressure being exerted to abolish the death penalty in the 43 countries which still include it in their national legislations must become a priority in the European Union 's policy for promoting human rights and , in particular , as part of the work of the new European External Action Service .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) As a citizen of Portugal , one of the first countries in the world to abolish the death penalty in 1867 , I consider the death penalty to be inhuman and the most extreme denial of human rights .
<en> It is therefore with satisfaction that I am voting in favour of this resolution 's motion .
<en> The promotion of human dignity and the consequential fight for the abolition of the death penalty are , and must remain , among the goals of the European Union human rights policy .
<en> For the sake of a global and effective European policy over the death penalty , the EU , through its institutions and , in particular through the High Representative , should speak with one voice .
<en> The establishment of a global moratorium on the use and imposition of the death penalty in every region of the world is not only a fundamental step on the road to abolishing the death penalty throughout the world .
<en> It is , above all , a vital step towards greater respect for humanity .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Maltese Labour delegation voted in favour of the report on health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and global health , which promotes fundamental issues and priorities to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and halve extreme poverty by 2015 .
<en> We also condemn the fact that in some areas , women are still subject to genital mutilation , violence and rape .
<en> We also fully agree with issues addressed in this report , especially the most pressing health problems in sub-Saharan Africa , and the general question of how to improve health care service provisions and social insurance schemes there .
<en> However , my delegation is not in agreement with the reference to the promotion of abortion in paragraph 6 of the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This report deals with a number of issues .
<en> Nevertheless , of great concern is paragraph 6 which deals with abortion .
<en> I am against abortion and cannot support a dossier that promotes these practices .
<en> This is why I have decided to vote against the report as amended .
<sp>
<2en> The Swedish Conservatives have today , 7 October 2010 , voted against the report on health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and global health .
<2en> However , we would like to point out that we believe that the report deals with a vitally important subject - access to health care is a basic prerequisite for development .
<2en> Hundreds of thousands of children in sub-Saharan Africa die each year of diseases that are not fatal for anyone who has access to basic care .
<2en> In our opinion , however , this report does not have the answer to the question of how this should be provided .
<2en> It is a fact that civil society has played , and in many countries continues to play , a very major role as care provider .
<2en> To categorically reject the work done by private care providers and non-governmental organisations is not the right way to go about things for someone who has the welfare of the poor in mind .
<2en> At the same time , we would like to stress that we do , of course , support the wording in the report concerning women 's reproductive health and the condemnation of genital mutilation and the terrible acts of violence that women are still being subjected to .
<sp>
<2en> As far as I see it , the main merit of the resolution on health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa and global health is that it tackles the issue on the basis of the specific features of the region in question .
<2en> There is a real problem in implanting a model for organising social protection systems which is specific to Western civilisation in a totally different context .
<2en> Many projects intended for developing countries have failed due to the adoption of an absolutist , Western-centrist approach , whether from Europe or the United States .
<2en> This has led to resources being wasted and additional problems being created for the countries concerned .
<2en> The specific situation of this area makes the observation even more obvious that we cannot treat health like a commodity .
<2en> Consequently , forms of health care need to be identified which can be provided on a non-profit basis , inspired by the values of solidarity and democracy .
<2en> The progress achieved over time , including through the contributions made by EU Member States , can be undone by adopting a hasty approach based on commercial considerations .
<2en> I feel that the resolution tackles the issue in a fair , coherent manner , which is why I voted for it .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I support this report which seeks , in light of the EU 's commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and halve extreme poverty by 2015 , to address the most pressing health problems in sub-Saharan Africa and the question of what systems can be put in place to do so .
<en> The report examines how universal , accessible and affordable health care systems can be set up and how we can share best practice from the European experience .
<en> In particular , the report looks at mutual health organisations which have already been established and proven to work effectively in several African states .
<en> Mutual health organisations are not intended to take the place of the state ; rather , they offer an alternative , enabling the obstacles to health care access to be overcome and providing improved access to quality health care for all citizens regardless of their income .
<en> Indeed , they have been able to tailor insurance provision to the socio-economic characteristics of populations in an informal economy which remain excluded from formal schemes and commercial insurance , and , as a result , they are an appropriate solution for achieving the goal of universal coverage in low- and middle-income countries .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The fact is , the Single Market Act is a revolution .
<2en> It is this Commission 's most tangible work programme .
<2en> It is our third large project after the introduction of the euro and the enlargement of the EU .
<2en> We need more dynamism , decisiveness , courage and European-mindedness in order to be able to implement the 50 proposals .
<2en> The single market must become the domestic market of 500 million people , because it represents our potential for growth , employment and competitiveness .
<2en> Many treasures are yet to be unearthed .
<2en> The single market will also make the so-called net contributors , such as Austria and Germany , into large net receivers .
<2en> Utilising the potential means freeing the single market from its chains , overcoming protectionism and nationalism and choosing to perceive the EU as a continent .
<2en> Whether this will succeed is primarily up to us politicians .
<2en> So , let us get on with the work !
<sp>
<2en> We can all agree with the intention of the European Commission to achieve a competitive social market economy .
<2en> The Commission 's reports contain specific proposals on strengthening the single market .
<2en> We trust that they will be implemented .
<2en> According to Commissioner Barnier , we need to take advantage of single market opportunities that have not been exploited so far .
<2en> Indeed , many achievements can be listed which have simplified our life within the EU .
<2en> However , the changes taking place in the world demand further measures .
<2en> The single market can be made even more unified .
<2en> I value the notion that the markets must serve both the economy and the citizens of the EU at one and the same time .
<2en> The rights of citizens and economic issues are dealt with in separate documents .
<2en> Hopefully , the reason for this is to balance these two poles of the market .
<2en> The EU 's role as initiator and coordinator in strengthening the single market is indisputable .
<2en> However , without the Member States ' commitment to implementation , we will have to wait for a long time for a good social system , high education standards and competitive jobs .
<2en> Although some question the importance of open consultation , I believe that all stakeholders should have an opportunity to express their opinion .
<2en> Similarly , I believe that the initiative to debate matters concerning the single market in the framework of an annual forum is a positive one .
<2en> The participants of this debate are logically the institutions , Member States , enterprises and citizens , in other words , all those involved in the single market .
<2en> The forum will also help raise awareness of the single market being part of our everyday lives .
<sp>
<2en> I fully support the content and timescales of the Small Business Act .
<2en> The single market is the most integrated form of the common market , since it is focused more on removing barriers - physical barriers ( borders ) , technical barriers ( standards ) and fiscal barriers - between Member States .
<2en> This is the key to integration and sustainable growth in Europe .
<2en> The current economic crisis has once again underlined the importance of the single market when it comes to making a success of the European project .
<2en> We also call for a renewed political will to resist the temptations of economic nationalism and to exploit everyone 's full potential .
<2en> The crisis has increased the risk of misuse of State aid that is designed to help the most important national firms .
<2en> The solution to the problem of reviving the entire European economy instead entails ( and this is the single market solution ) removing the persistent obstacles to the free movement of goods , persons and services , and to equal treatment of economic operators and citizens throughout the EU .
<sp>
<2en> The Single Market Act is an initiative which I strongly welcome and support .
<2en> However , I would like to mention a problem that I sense here , and not a marginal one .
<2en> It is about the long-term communications strategy not only for this document , but for the single market in general .
<2en> In point 48 of the report , the Commission states that it has enhanced consultation and dialogue with civil society , while particular attention will be given to ensuring that the views of consumers are taken into account .
<2en> If the Commission does indeed stand for the views of ordinary consumers , it must do much more than before to promote this report in the media .
<2en> For example , in the Czech Republic and Slovakia , the introduction of this fundamental document is unfortunately completely absent from the media .
<2en> It seems that here , it is not a topic worthy of attention .
<2en> The information campaign on the benefits of the single internal market should therefore not take place only at the level of the European institutions , but should be more decentralised at both national and regional levels .
<2en> The focus should mainly be on the benefits offered by the single market and on the resolution of the everyday problems of consumers in the internal market , such as , for example , bank charges , comparison of the prices of goods , and so on .
<2en> I would therefore call on the Commission to improve its communications strategy towards end users so that citizens will be better informed about the benefits of the single market .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The renewal of the scientific and technological cooperation agreement between the European Community and Ukraine is extremely important in order to continue facilitating cooperation in both the shared priority areas of science and technology , which bring socio-economic benefits to both parties .
<2en> This is why , in the plenary sitting , I have given my support to Parliament approving the renewal of the agreement , in line with what we decided in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
<2en> This agreement should enable Ukraine and the EU to benefit mutually from the scientific and technical progress made through their research programmes , at the same time enabling the transfer of knowledge to benefit the scientific community , industry and Europeans .
<2en> With regard to specific results , the renewal of the agreement will allow the continued exchange of information on science and technology policies between the EU and Ukraine .
<2en> It will also enable Ukraine to take part in certain areas of the European Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and enable training to take place through mobility programmes for researchers and specialists from both sides , among other things .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Very easy vote , this one .
<en> We simply had to agree , and we did .
<sp>
<2en> Scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and other countries is vital for technological development , with all its advantages , including in relation to improving people 's quality of life .
<2en> For this reason , I voted in favour of the renewal of the agreement between the EU and the Faroe Islands .
<sp>
<2en> The EU and the Faroes have concluded their negotiations on establishing a scientific and technological cooperation agreement , which was initialled on 13 July 2009 .
<2en> The agreement is based on the principles of mutual benefit , reciprocal opportunities to access the programmes and activities relevant to the purposes of the agreement , non-discrimination , effective protection of intellectual property , and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights .
<2en> This scientific and technological association agreement will help to structure and improve cooperation on these matters between the EU and the Faroes , through regular meetings of its Joint Committee , in which specific cooperation activities can be planned .
<2en> I hope that the agreement that has just been adopted proves advantageous to both parties .
<sp>
<2en> The EU and the Faroe Islands have concluded their negotiations on the establishment of an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation , with the aim of facilitating free movement and residence for researchers involved in activities covered by this agreement and in order to facilitate the cross-border movement of goods for use in such activities .
<2en> I voted in favour of this agreement as I believe that its renewal contributes to strengthening the creation of the common European Research Area .
<2en> I therefore hope that the renewal of the agreement will bear fruit for both parties .

<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The increased use of electrical and electronic equipment , combined with their considerable technological development , has led to an ever shortening life cycle .
<en> This , in turn , has led to serious problems with regard to the use of dangerous substances in this equipment , as well as difficulties in the management of the ever larger quantity of waste .
<en> Therefore , this directive relating to the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances ( RoHS ) is aimed at broadening its scope and strengthening its preventative part , so that environmental damage may be corrected at source as a priority , in line with Article 174 ( 2 ) of the treaty .
<en> This recast is essential for there to be a successful reduction of hazardous substances in this type of equipment .
<sp>
<2en> I fully support Mrs Evans 's report .
<2en> However , I should like to add that this issue should be paid more attention .
<2en> The use of lead , magnesium , mercury and rare-earth metals in electronics and industrial technology is unavoidable .
<2en> Our task is to compel manufacturers to move over to less harmful materials .
<2en> Where that is not possible , it is essential that the public be informed of the potentially deleterious effect on consumers of all the harmful substances that have been used .
<sp>
<2en> The directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment ( RoHS ) governs the use of hazardous substances in devices and components .
<2en> It is also an important instrument for setting a European , as well as global , standard for manufacturers .
<2en> The extension of the scope of the directive is intended to also take account of the waste treatment of hazardous substances .
<2en> I abstained from voting , as the report does not yet completely resolve all of the problems associated with the handling of hazardous substances .
<sp>
<2en> There has certainly been a rapid growth in the market for electrical equipment , in particular in the areas of IT and telecommunications .
<2en> This and the ever shorter innovation cycles are also resulting in ever increasing amounts of electrical waste .
<2en> The recast of the RoHS Directive is aimed at preventing the use of hazardous substances that could harm the environment or human health .
<2en> Some of the proposals are controversial : on the one hand , large computer manufacturers like HP , ACER or Sony Ericsson have pronounced themselves in favour of a ban on all brominated flame retardants in electrical and electronic equipment .
<2en> On the other hand , the results of the Commission 's studies are clearly not very conclusive , at least as regards the potential damage to the environment .
<2en> In addition , there are concerns being expressed by the industry with regard to the ban on PVC , particularly in the area of the cables industry .
<2en> The negative properties of PVC are disputed and there is a fear that costs will increase if there is a ban on PVC-covered cables .
<2en> These arguments need to be weighed up before specific bans are laid down .
<2en> I have therefore abstained from voting .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report for a variety of reasons .
<2en> I agree that fixed installations and photovoltaic panels should be excluded from the scope of the directive .
<2en> I was also pleased at the adoption of a methodology for reviewing the hazardous substances contained in Annex IV , as it means that the list of substances to be examined by the Commission ( Annex III ) can be removed .
<2en> I also believe that the not overly broad definition of ' dependency ' to mean needing electricity for equipment operation is correct .
<2en> I also believe it premature for the legislation to cover the evaluation of nanomaterials , which are currently being examined by the Commission .
<2en> Lastly , I applaud the fact that the scope is ' open ' to include all electrical and electronic equipment .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The institution of the European Ombudsman safeguards the right , anchored in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , of every citizen ' to have his or her affairs handled impartially , fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union ' .
<2en> The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon increased the democratic legitimacy of the Ombudsman thanks to his election by the European Parliament and extends his remit to include the common foreign and security policy and the activities of the European Council .
<2en> I voted for this resolution because I welcome the results of activities in 2009 .
<2en> The average time taken to consider complaints fell by four months in 2009 , and more than half of the procedures initiated were concluded by an amicable resolution .
<2en> This bears witness to the effective cooperation which exists between the Ombudsman and the institutions and bodies of the Union .
<2en> I feel that it is necessary to increase EU citizens ' confidence in the EU and its institutions and , above all , to ensure that citizens have every opportunity to obtain the information they require and have faith in the ability of EU institutions to defend their rights .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report because through his work , the Ombudsman is helping European institutions to adopt transparent decisions which can be accessed by all citizens and legal persons .
<2en> The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon increased the democratic legitimacy of the Ombudsman thanks to his election by the European Parliament and extends his remit to include the common foreign and security policy and the activities of the European Council .
<2en> Transparency , access to information and respect for the right to good administration are vital preconditions for maintaining citizens ' confidence in the institutions ' ability to assert their rights .
<2en> The most common types of alleged maladministration were lack of transparency .
<2en> Therefore , it is essential to ensure that citizens receive prompt and substantive responses to their enquiries , complaints and petitions .
<2en> The European institutions and bodies must provide citizens with the information they require .
<2en> I welcome the collaboration between the European Ombudsman and ombudsmen and similar bodies at national , regional and local levels in the Member States .
<sp>
<2en> The role of the European administration is vast and complex .
<2en> I voted in favour of this report as I believe it is vital to ensure public confidence in the European institutions through efficient administration , with transparent procedures and easy access to infrastructure .
<2en> I welcome the positive results in the reduction in complaints and the improvement in handling them at a European level .
<sp>
<2en> The work of the Ombudsman is essential and contributes to greater transparency , bringing the EU closer to the public , while strengthening public confidence in the ability of the institutions to enforce their rights .
<2en> Although , in 2009 , there was a small reduction in the number of complaints ( 9 % ) in comparison with 2008 , of the 335 cases opened , approximately 318 were concluded and closed .
<2en> The fact that 56 % of cases were closed having reached an amicable agreement or been solved is fairly positive .
<2en> These results demonstrate that there is constructive cooperation between the Ombudsman and the EU 's institutions and bodies , which , for the most part , see these complaints as a perfect opportunity to remedy any mistakes made and cooperate with the Ombudsman on behalf of members of the public .
<2en> I would like to emphasise the importance of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , in which the right to good administration was inscribed among the fundamental rights inherent to EU citizenship .
<2en> Two substantial amendments were also made : that the Ombudsman should be elected , strengthening his democratic legitimacy , and that his mandate should be extended to the common foreign and security policy .
<sp>
<2en> The report on the European Ombudsman 's activities in 2009 is of great interest , since it allows us to assess whether and to what extent the relationship between the EU institutions and the people is transparent , quick and effective .
<2en> There are many topics , in fact , on which Parliament and the Commission express their views without receiving any feedback from the public apart from the complaints made to the Ombudsman .
<2en> While I approve the report , however , I think the European Ombudsman himself and the work he does should be more widely publicised , especially in the Member States where he is not immediately recognisable .
<2en> In fact , it should never be forgotten that a small number of complaints can mean either that people do not notice many irregularities or that they have little confidence in a possible legal solution to their problems .
<2en> Providing greater publicity would be a way of expanding the survey , so that we would be able to state more confidently which of the two scenarios above applies in this case .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I decided to vote for the report on generalised tariff preferences as it proposed the immediate adaptation of the ' Generalised System of Preferences ' to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon , as well as a general review of the scheme in the future .
<2en> This general review would be aimed at increasing the involvement of beneficiary countries in the reform processes which affect them , granting technical assistance to help develop their institutional capacity , as well as at reviewing and harmonising the rules of origin .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Parliament has just agreed to extend the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) for developing countries to run from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013 .
<en> The GSP scheme is due to be reviewed this year , a process that should take into account the concerns expressed in the Committee on International Trade .
<en> We are calling for greater transparency and genuine cooperation during the GSP negotiations with each country .
<en> Commissioner De Gucht has undertaken to ensure that the European Parliament is closely involved in the decision-making process .
<en> He must now keep that promise .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The current regulation which establishes the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) will expire by the end of this year .
<en> However , since the Commission is still awaiting the conclusion of a study on the matter , so as to present a new proposal for the GSP , in order to avoid a legal vacuum it was decided to extend the existing regulation and its current arrangements for another two years .
<en> However , the Commission needs to present a legislative initiative on this subject very soon , because the current system needs to be reviewed and made more effective as a matter of urgency .
<en> I therefore endorse the main points highlighted by the rapporteur , to be reviewed in this legislative proposal by the Commission .
<en> These propose an effective system that will respond better to the interests of the recipient countries and economic operators , and rules that provide for a reform process which ensures the participation of the recipients and which will also ensure that Parliament can carry out its task of democratic oversight .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) In 1968 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) recommended the creation of a Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) under which countries that were considered to be more developed would support developing countries by granting trade preferences .
<en> The European Community was the first to implement a GSP scheme in 1971 .
<en> This has proved to be one of the key methods for cooperation at the level of international trade with developing countries , by reducing poverty .
<en> The current regulation needs to be updated as it is due to lapse and as it is not covered in the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> It also requires substantial reform .
<en> Although this proposal does not yet constitute a new regulation , the drafting of which is necessary , I would like to express my agreement with the report under discussion , and I hope that the Commission will submit a new proposal as soon as possible , so that the EU can continue to support developing countries .
<sp>
<2en> The Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) is a trade mechanism which allows the EU to grant developing countries preferential , non-reciprocal access to its market through tariff reductions .
<2en> While it is defined as a tool for development aid , this mechanism is not free of contradictions , especially between some of its stated purposes and the results that are actually obtained .
<2en> In effect , many developing countries have become increasingly economically dependent and have been shaping their economies according to a model of reduced diversification , based on a limited set of products for export , instead of developing their internal markets .
<2en> An international division of labour has become ingrained .
<2en> This is unfavourable to these countries ; it is often the large multinationals , some of them European , that reap the greatest benefits from this system .
<2en> There needs to be a comprehensive review of this mechanism , along with a thorough discussion of its various aspects and complexities and their impact not only on developing countries , but also on the EU Member States , particularly the weakest .
<2en> Given the Commission 's delay in submitting a new proposal for regulation , which means that it cannot enter into force immediately after the term of the existing regulation , there needs to be an extension of the existing ...

<sp>
<2en> On Wednesday , 6 April 2011 , the European Parliament adopted the report on the so-called Asylum Procedures Directive .
<2en> This vote represents an important step towards creating a genuine European policy on asylum , which we have long requested .
<2en> Furthermore , this adoption is a clear sign that the EU needs a common European asylum system ( CEAS ) by 2012 , especially since recent events in the Southern Mediterranean and the recent migration flows from North Africa have clearly proved the limitations of the current European system .
<2en> There is an urgent need to revise the EU directives for a credible and efficient system .
<2en> Specifically , it is my firm belief that the provisions relating to the accelerated procedure and the rejection of manifestly unfounded applications should not apply to unaccompanied minors or asylum seekers with special needs , so I voted in favour of those amendments that specified otherwise .
<2en> Secondly , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe was totally opposed to adding further grounds for allowing an accelerated review of an application for asylum , given the risks that these provisions present for asylum seekers , and I deeply regret that the corresponding amendments were adopted by such a small majority .
<2en> Finally , with regard to the ' safe third country ' concept , I chose to abstain .
<sp>
<2en> We must work harder than ever to establish a genuine common European asylum system ( CEAS ) for 2012 by better protecting applicants ' rights and improving the quality of procedures .
<2en> My report goes in that direction , in particular , by including the right to free legal advice from the start of the procedure ; better consideration of vulnerable applicants , such as unaccompanied minors ; and a framework for the time limit for appeals .
<2en> I regret that the European right only targeted the tightening of accelerated procedures based on the notion that asylum seekers are almost all potential fraudsters , because this perspective on asylum is out of all proportion .
<2en> In my opinion , more robust procedures and decisions and faster examination of cases will mean that there are fewer appeals and unfounded applications will be more easily identified .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Guillaume report covers important areas of law and emphasises the need for human rights to be fully respected in relation to people seeking asylum .
<en> My own country , Scotland , does not as yet have control over immigration .
<en> However , the policies which have been implemented by successive UK governments have been quite inhumane .
<en> I am proud to be a member of a party which has actively campaigned against the brutal incarceration of young children seeking asylum .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this document because I believe that we should seize this opportunity to develop a common European asylum system that is fair and efficient .
<2en> Asylum policies have a direct impact on those seeking protection , as well as on the European Union 's ability to develop and create a genuine area of freedom , security and justice .
<2en> It is necessary to ensure harmonised , fair and efficient procedures under the common European asylum system .
<sp>
<2en> The proposal referred to Parliament for a directive regarding the possible provision of a unified procedure for the 27 States of the Union in granting the right of asylum is an important step , but the delicacy of the issue requires careful and thorough reflection .
<2en> The ultimate goal is to ensure that States draw their laws closer to one another in accordance with the commitments made under the Treaty of Stockholm , simplifying and speeding up the procedures .
<2en> Another goal is to provide a high degree of protection for asylum seekers , ensuring a rapid verdict in the first instance , free legal assistance and permission to stay in the country until the final ruling .
<2en> Notwithstanding the good intentions , I voted against this draft directive as it is imprecise on some technical and procedural aspects and some of the definitions are ambiguous .
<2en> In fact , it is formulated in such a manner that the directive would lend itself to easy abuse on the part of applicants .
<2en> For these reasons , I decided not to support this version of the text as I do not agree with it totally .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament 's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency 's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency should consider making a Gantt diagram part of the programming for each of its operational activities , with a view to indicating in a concise form the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encouraging an approach geared towards achieving results .
<en> Furthermore , the Agency must implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts and improve performance monitoring and reporting .
<en> The Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year , so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency 's performance from one year to the next more effectively .
<en> In addition , a report must be attached to each year 's budget on the unspent appropriations carried over from previous years , explaining why those monies have not been used and how and when they will be used .
<en> The Agency still demonstrates deficiencies in staff selection procedures , which put at risk the transparency of these procedures .
<en> I agree that the Agency must inform the European Parliament on the actions taken to redress this situation and make selection procedures more transparent .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of discharge for 2009 for the General Budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency because , in spite of apparently dubious management of the funds available , the Court of Auditors has considered the accounts to be reliable and the underlying transactions legal and regular .
<2en> Moreover , I agree on the need for the agency to put in place more precise mechanisms for setting its objectives and for evaluating the results .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I welcome the decisions outlined in the report by the Court of Auditors that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> I welcome and agree with the rapporteur 's observations , and I congratulate the European Aviation Safety Agency on the work it does .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I endorsed this document , as the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> However , it expressed concern about the lack of coordination between the needs , staff and financial regulation of the Agency and , in particular , that staff selection procedures made it difficult to recruit appropriately qualified personnel .
<en> I therefore believe that it is necessary to take the current observations into account .
<sp>
<2en> With today 's vote budgetary discharge for 2009 has been granted to the European Aviation Safety Agency .
<2en> Financial control of the implementation of the Community budget takes place at three levels : internal control , within each institution ; external control by the European Court of Auditors ; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament .
<2en> Clearly , every debate on discharge has its own specific context and today 's discharge has taken place at a time of economic and financial crisis , which has created both financial and budgetary problems for some Member States .
<2en> In spite of such conditions , I wish , nonetheless , to express satisfaction at the results achieved by the Agency and have therefore voted in the manner proposed by the rapporteur .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament 's decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the Agency 's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> I agree with the rapporteur that using two locations ( Lille and Valenciennes ) for carrying out its activities exposes the Agency to additional costs .
<en> I therefore believe that action must be taken by the Council to change the decision obliging the Agency to have a double seat .
<en> I believe that the Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency 's performance from one year to the next more effectively .
<en> I congratulate the Agency , following the Court of Auditors ' comments , on implementing a centralised system for registration of incoming invoices .
<en> This measure is necessary to ensure the timely recording of all invoices and contributes to avoiding delays in processing payments .
<en> I welcome the Agency 's initiative to set up an Internal Audit Capability that is dedicated to providing support and advice to its Director and management on internal control , risk assessment and internal audit .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009 , because Parliament granted its director discharge in May .
<2en> However , I agree - as the report says - that the carryover of appropriations needs to be better managed because they are in breach of the budgetary principle of annuality .
<2en> I also agree with the observations by the Court of Auditors about delays in procurement procedures .
<2en> I have a positive take on the effort made to bring in a centralised system for registration of incoming invoices , which is necessary to improve their management .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Railway Agency since , as the report shows , it managed its resources well overall .
<2en> I also agree on the need to make a number of improvements in the area of auditing the accounts and managing the budget in order to reduce the level of carryovers and cancellations , which is still too high .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The European railways sector suffers from the incompatibility of national technical and safety rules , representing a serious disadvantage for its development .
<en> It is for the agency to reduce this gulf and to establish common safety objectives .
<en> Having two separate headquarters leads to increased costs , which perhaps should not be the case .
<en> The delay in carrying out a number of activities calls into question the principle of budgetary annuality , which has caused the carryover of budgetary appropriations .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I abstained from the vote on this document , although the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The budget of the Agency for the year 2009 was 16.6 % less than its budget for 2008 .
<en> The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> It is worrying that concern was expressed over the weaknesses in procurement procedures revealed by the Court of Auditors ' audit - cancellations and delays in procurement procedures , recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year .
<en> The Court of Auditors identified shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets ' inventory , but notes the Agency 's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts .
<en> I feel that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites .
<en> This is also the reason for my abstention .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Once again , I voted in favour of this report which points out that real savings could be made if Parliament only had one workplace , in the same city as the European Union 's other institutions ( in other words Brussels ) .
<2en> The report of the Secretary-General on Parliament 's preliminary draft estimates for 2011 itself draws attention to the huge annual costs arising from the geographical split of Parliament , estimated at some EUR 160 000 000 , which accounts for 9 % of Parliament 's total budget .
<2en> It is true that at present the decision to change this situation , and in doing so to make some EUR 160 000 000 of savings per year , whilst at the same time considerably lessening Parliament 's carbon footprint , lies solely with the Council .
<2en> However through this vote , I call upon Parliament 's President and the Members who are negotiating the Union budget on behalf of Parliament to suggest to the Council that it take steps to ensure that the Union can make these savings .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for the report on discharge of the European Parliament budget 2009 , since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions .
<2en> I believe that it would be useful to review the European Parliament budget in the long term , in order to reduce costs and create resources for the efficient functioning of the Parliament in the context of its increased competences arising from the Treaty of Lisbon .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I would like to emphasise that , as a public institution , the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible .
<en> I also believe , particularly in view of the current economic situation , that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency .
<en> Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues , which is why I would like to provide more room for the discharge debate .
<en> I also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel .
<en> Finally , I do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes .
<en> However , I am highly critical of Parliament 's Prize for Journalism , and I do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament .
<en> I therefore believe that this prize should be abolished .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - On the discharge Report of the European Parliament for 2009 , I voted in line with my political Group against paragraph 143 on airmiles .
<en> The same concept is already covered by paragraph 199 on which I voted in favour .
<en> Paragraph 119 is more comprehensive and more practical for implementation purposes .
<sp>
<2en> We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to grant discharge to the European Parliament for the financial year 2009 .
<2en> We would like to emphasise that , as a public institution , the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible .
<2en> We therefore chose to support paragraph 5 , which calls for greater transparency with regard to Members ' expenditure allowance .
<2en> We also believe , particularly in view of the current economic situation , that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency .
<2en> Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues , which is why we would also like to provide more room for the discharge debate .
<2en> We also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel , even though we find it difficult to see how this could be implemented in practice .
<2en> Finally , we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes .
<2en> However , we are highly critical of Parliament 's Prize for Journalism , and do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament .
<2en> We therefore believe that this prize should be abolished .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> In voting for the report by Mrs Schaake , I am making a plea for the institution of a genuine European cultural diplomacy in order to promote our values outside the EU .
<2en> Thinking of culture as a strategic element of foreign policy would , in fact , enable Europe to make up the deficit with regard to certain states .
<2en> China , in particular , invests heavily in cultural diplomacy to improve its image and attract tourists .
<2en> Europe must do the same if it is to continue playing a major role on the world stage .
<2en> This report contains several proposals to achieve this : the proposal to designate a person in every EU representation in third countries , for example , to coordinate cultural relations and interaction between the EU and those countries , or the proposal that the draft European External Action Service ( EEAS ) organisational chart contain posts tailored to cultural aspects and that a coordination unit be set up .
<2en> Moreover , it seems opportune that third countries be involved to a greater extent in EU programmes devoted to culture as much as mobility , youth , education and training : the accessibility to these programmes on the part of young nationals of those countries must be facilitated .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The report did envisage at first the field of external relations at the EU level almost exclusively under the new media perspectives .
<en> This is still quite present , as well as the idea that the EU should export its culture .
<en> The Greens insisted on the promotion of ' cultural cooperation ' instead .
<en> Some of the recommendations adopted in the Committee on Culture and Education do not really create something new , like an information website on EU culture programmes and external relations , together with the calendar of EU events in the whole world plus contacts with Civil Society .
<en> Some articles , like Article 44 on supporting national efforts to implement the protection and preservation of cultural heritage , illegal trade of heritage or products of cultural creation , do not give much sense to the issue itself .
<en> In a nutshell , the report fails really to tackle the issue and assembles bits and pieces alongside the present existing possibilities to put culture on the agenda both for the EU and between the EU and third countries .
<en> It is a new chapter in an effort to fully use culture as a tool for peace .
<sp>
<2en> The sharing of cultural heritage between individuals is important both within the EU , for the consolidation of a European identity , and in terms of the Union 's relations with third countries .
<2en> This is why I support strengthening external action in that direction .
<2en> Resources for culture are often scattered across a host of projects .
<2en> Efficient use of these funds is further hampered by political fragmentation .
<2en> We therefore need the European External Action Service to immediately adopt a coherent and unified strategy of cultural diplomacy , including the appointment of an EU special representative to third countries .
<2en> Lastly , I believe that we should increasingly emphasise the use of new technologies , which can increase the number of ways to access cultural content .
<2en> It is essential for the EU to play a leading role in this context , developing definite policies that can protect the Internet against forms of censure typical of repressive regimes .
<sp>
<2en> In 1990 , in his book Bound to Lead , the eminent American professor , Joseph Nye , invented the concept of ' soft power ' .
<2en> What does it mean ?
<2en> Soft power is the capacity an international player has to influence others by non-coercive means , such as cultural dynamism .
<2en> Why , after a quarter of a century , does the United States remain the superpower that we know it to be ?
<2en> Because , besides its military arsenal , it succeeds in exporting its culture and its ideas and in making them attractive .
<2en> Europe must do the same ; it must defend its cultural model and its values on the international stage .
<2en> Thanks to this report , the European Union is taking stock of the influence Europe can have if it succeeds in adding a cultural dimension to its diplomacy .
<2en> I therefore support the recommendations contained in this report .
<2en> It is the case that , in waiting for the implementation of a genuine common diplomacy and a genuine European defence policy , European soft power and its cultural diplomacy are some of the few means of influence at our disposal .
<sp>
<2en> I endorsed the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU 's external actions .
<2en> In particular , I would like to stress the necessity of conducting a review of existing programmes with a cultural component and of drafting a Green Paper and a communication from the Commission outlining concrete policies for the role of culture in the EU 's external actions .
<2en> Currently , cultural cooperation of Member States with third countries takes place on a bilateral basis .
<2en> There is a lack of shared and coordinated principles and actions , which renders it impossible to make effective use of Europe 's cultural resources and the Union 's creative potential .
<2en> A common strategy can foster the development of Europe 's cultural resources , the forging and deepening of social relations , the exchange of good practices and improvement of the EU 's cultural position in the international arena .
<2en> I strongly support inclusion of cultural aspects in the draft organisation chart of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
<2en> It is also important to provide for the appropriate training of EEAS staff with regard to cultural and digital aspects .
<2en> Culture is also an important factor in the fight for human rights and the support of democracy .
<2en> Cooperation in this area will help to establish dialogue with societies from different cultures .
<2en> I am also a supporter of what is called ' brand Europe ' , and the development and promotion of this , in such areas as support for talent , tourism and the propagation of universal values , for example , should be based on closer collaboration between the EU 's Member States .

<sp>
<2en> The project to implement a European satellite navigation programme is a major challenge and undoubtedly useful for the future of technology in Europe , but the forecasts of expenditure and investment by the European bodies for this project are still not clear or transparent at present .
<2en> Further expenditure is expected in a few years ' time , in addition to that initially planned by the programme , and I believe it is likely that additional sums will be needed to complete the project .
<2en> I therefore abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) It is with satisfaction that I voted in favour of this report , which is the culmination of a far-reaching political decision , particularly regarding the implementation of Galileo .
<en> It is absolutely crucial that the European autonomous satellite radionavigation system be commissioned as soon as possible and , as the report highlights , with long-term funding guarantees .
<en> Competition from the United States ( with the Global Positioning System - GPS ) requires us to introduce Galileo quickly , bearing in mind what is at stake economically , technically , politically and strategically .
<sp>
<2en> The European Union has set itself the objective of becoming the world leader in Global Navigation Satellite Systems ( GNSS ) with the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service ( EGNOS ) and Galileo programmes , thus ensuring its technological independence from American GPS .
<2en> Considering the significant economic returns from such programmes , I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by 2018 , thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the American system .

<en> in writing . - At a time when the Commission , and indeed this Parliament , ought to be searching for , and bringing forward , proposals on how to save money , we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework .
<en> Let us not forget that this is against a backdrop where the Galileo satellite project started off with a budget of EUR 7.7 billion and is now projected to cost EUR 22.6 billion .
<en> To such a proposal , I categorically say no .
<en> Current budget lines already in place for this project are easily sufficient to bring about its completion , yet - true to form - the suggestion is to spend even more .
<en> I know that if I speak to my constituents , they will give little support to the current spending on Galileo , let alone an increase .
<en> Again , I urge MEPs and the Commission to be realistic and to be cautious with the money we have and with which we should aim to bring maximum benefit to our constituents .
<sp>
<2en> European satellite navigation systems have been causing delays and additional costs , which should lead those responsible to give thought to the patterns currently being followed for their implementation .
<2en> At a time when countries like Portugal are resorting to aid from the other Member States , and when Europe is , as such , facing a serious economic and financial crisis that threatens its stability , an even greater effort should be made to avoid cost overruns and excessive expense .
<2en> I am not questioning the strategic importance of these projects , but I cannot fail to highlight that they have been falling short of expectations .
<2en> I agree that , as both Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service ( EGNOS ) are European programmes and are in the common public interest of the Union , they should , overall , be financed through the EU budget , but I think that other possible sources should be weighed up , including innovative forms of financing .

<en> , in writing . - ( CS ) I have no major reservations about the EU-Canada Agreement on civil aviation safety .
<en> I nonetheless abstained from the vote .
<en> The reason for this is the unresolved situation in the relationship between the EU , the Czech Republic and Canada regarding the lifting of the unilateral visa requirement for Czech citizens .
<en> I have repeatedly warned that the Parliament of the Czech Republic will block ratification of the related aviation agreement for the same reasons .
<en> I would like to call on the Commission finally to address this problem with full seriousness .
<en> The lukewarm attitude of Commissioner Malmström is the reason why the situation remains unresolved after two years , and it has contributed to the deterioration in relations between the Czech Republic and Canada .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - In favour .
<en> This recommendation deals with the Safety Agreement that was signed on behalf of the ( then ) European Community on 6 May 2009 .
<en> The EU-Canada Air Transport Agreement , signed on 17-18 December 2009 and which will finally establish a full Open Aviation Area between the EU and Canada , will be the subject of a separate recommendation .
<en> Only six Member States currently have bilateral agreements with Canada covering product certification .
<en> These will lapse when the EU-Canada Civil Aviation Safety Agreement ( " the Agreement ” ) enters into force .
<en> As the removal of technical barriers to trade in goods comes within the exclusive competence of the Union , the Agreement can be concluded by means of a Council Decision .
<en> Unlike the Air Transport Agreement , it is not subject to provisional application and does not require ratification by the Member States .
<en> It is appropriate that Canada was seen as a priority for an Air Safety Agreement to complement the Air Transport Agreement as Europe and Canada each have aircraft , engine and avionics manufacturers that are world leaders .
<en> The combined exports of civil aviation technology exceed € 50 billion while European and Canadian overall trade in aircraft , spacecraft and parts was worth more than € 49 billion in 2008 .
<sp>
<2en> This Agreement on civil aviation safety , concluded between the EU and Canada , follows the horizontal agreement already adopted by Parliament in March 2011 .
<2en> Canada is a strategic country in this area for EU Member States , as both parties are world leaders in the manufacture of aircraft , engines and avionics ; it is also currently the EU 's 11th-most important trade partner .
<2en> The objectives of this Agreement focus on making trade in goods and services easier by removing technical barriers , and on reducing duplication of regulatory airworthiness assessments , tests and controls by implementing the reciprocity principle .
<2en> The creation of an Open Aviation Area will bring economic benefits for both parties .
<2en> Greater simplification and reduction of administrative costs to European and Canadian companies will bring greater economic competitiveness and safety for passengers .
<2en> As a substitute member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , I voted in favour of this report , but I would stress again that Parliament should take up its new responsibilities enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon , and be kept informed at all stages of the process of negotiating international agreements .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The Agreement is intended to minimise duplicated assessments , tests and controls by enabling both parties to use the certification system of the other .
<en> This mutual trust in the system operated by the contracting party is based on an approximation of the requirements and regulatory processes , as well as regular consultations between the parties and the establishment of a joint committee .
<en> Because of the shorter and more cost-effective product-approval procedures permitted , the companies working in that sector will save millions each year and will be able to increase their competitiveness .
<en> The Agreement will make the market more competitive and safer , because enforcement authorities will be required to cooperate more extensively .
<sp>
<2en> This report notes that sound financial discipline and transparency in the allocation of funds are key preconditions for achieving cohesion policy 's overall objectives , contributing towards increasing accountability as regards strategic objectives .
<2en> Additional efforts are needed to avoid excessive delays and to improve implementation performance .
<2en> I would also stress the need for more synergies with other policy instruments .
<2en> Cohesion policy should continue to help the poorest regions catch up and adapt its objectives to present and future challenges , providing smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I have voted in favour of this report .
<en> One of the reasons why the Lisbon Strategy was unable to achieve its goals was the poor integration of the cities and regions .
<en> Among the rapporteur 's proposals is a fundamental change to the way in which funds are allocated : ' projects should not be drafted to withdraw the funds available but to meet the strategic goals . '
<sp>
<2en> I am voting for this report as it points to the need to take concrete decisions on certain key issues for future cohesion policy , including strengthening Objective 3 .
<2en> In this area it is important not to leave out the most isolated and outermost regions .
<2en> The objective of territorial cooperation is essential to putting cohesion policy into practice .
<2en> I would like to highlight European Groupings for Territorial Cooperation ( EGTCs ) , which make a significant contribution to cohesion through cross-territorial cooperation programmes .
<sp>
<2en> Serving the harmonious development of the EU is one of the objectives of cohesion policy , which is an indispensable instrument for reinforcing the economic , social and territorial reality of Europe , as well as an essential factor for the realisation of smart and inclusive growth as anticipated in the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> I support this report as I feel that territorial cohesion should be adequately supported through the allocation of greater structural funds , and it is therefore right that the share allocated to Objective 3 be increased from the current 2.5 % to 7 % , considering in addition that around 37.5 % of the European population lives in border regions .
<2en> Allocating greater resources would mean , in the first place , investing in the trans-European transport networks ( TEN-Ts ) , for which modernisation is an urgent priority ; and , secondly , proceeding to reduce the physical , cultural , administrative and regulatory obstacles which hamper cooperation and territorial cohesion .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Dear Mr. President , I voted in favour of this report because it stresses that the European territorial cooperation , with its significant contribution to the multi-level governance model , is one of the pillars of the cohesion policy .
<en> Considering that the territorial cooperation has proved its effectiveness in promoting the harmonious development of the Union as a whole , it 's now fundamental to increase its budget from the actual 2.5 % to at least the 7 % of the overall cohesion policy resources for the next programming period .
<sp>
<2en> Although I represent the Centre , Auvergne and Limousin regions , which do not have borders with other Member States of the European Union , I am convinced of the usefulness of cross-border cooperation - and , more generally , of territorial cooperation - for the development of Europe and for building bridges between people .
<2en> I completely agree with the proposals brought forward by the rapporteur , my colleague Mrs Sanchez-Schmid , particularly when it comes to enhancing the role of the European Groupings for Territorial Cooperation ( EGTCs ) and the financing of this objective .
