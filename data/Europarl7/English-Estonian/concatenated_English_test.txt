<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , when I last spoke on this issue in February , I drew to the Commissioner 's attention the fact that I did not like all the recommendations in Parliament 's report , such as the size of the capital , because I felt that would make any statute along those lines discriminatory in favour of larger companies .
<en> Therefore , I welcome the fact that in the Commissioner 's latest consultation , he is urging responses by SMEs .
<en> However , we all need to be proactive in seeking those , with emphasis on the small rather than the medium .
<en> I shall certainly be doing this within my region and I am pleased to say that there are other bodies within the UK doing likewise , so I welcome efforts to establish the relevance to small companies .
<en> This is particularly the case when it is information from smaller companies that is frequently lacking , while , at the same time , we readily acknowledge that it is just those companies that do not have the means to deal with the different laws and regulations and , therefore , in theory at least it is those who we want to benefit most from the statute .
<en> As I see it , this House has made some proposals that would render the statute unlikely to find favour with those very smaller companies , so there is a problem .
<en> My message is to keep it simple otherwise , for small companies at least , it would just be a fig leaf for no change .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the competitiveness of companies and the efficiency of the internal market also require appropriate and up-to-date legal statutes for companies .
<en> Some progress has been made in the case of large undertakings , with the adoption of the regulation on the European Private Company Statute on 8 October 2001 .
<en> In 2004 , the European Commission opened up a discussion on a new form of European company , designed more specifically for small and medium-sized undertakings : the European Private Company .
<en> That initiative was very warmly welcomed by all those who had been awaiting it for the past 30 years - yes , 30 years .
<en> The results of the feasibility study on the Statute by the Commission were presented in December 2005 .
<en> It clearly showed that the vast majority of the economic operators interviewed wanted such a statute , for two main reasons .
<en> Firstly , the introduction of a European statute would have the advantage of removing obstacles to the establishment and mobility of SMEs in the European Union .
<en> Secondly , it would enable a European label to be created for SMEs , particularly those in the new Member States .
<en> For SMEs , the European Private Company seems an effective way of accessing the European market .
<en> Its adoption would also indirectly contribute to the evolution and harmonisation of national law , which , in turn , encourages the development and integration of the European economy .
<en> This new statute would meet the need to simplify the legal instruments available to companies and make them more effective .
<en> It is my belief that many small and medium-sized undertakings would gain from such a statute , which would , obviously , remain optional .
<en> The European Private Company plan is strongly supported in economic circles in virtually all the Member States .
<en> That is certainly the case in France and Germany .
<en> Parliament has approved the own-initiative report by Mr Lehne , whose conclusions I support , but at the moment no progress is being made .
<en> That is why I am supporting the questions to the Commission from Mr Gargani , on behalf of JURI .
<en> It is important to know what are the fundamental problems that have caused the Commission to delay its work on this issue .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I share the point of view expressed by President Gargani and Mr Lehne on the need to press forward with European Union rules on company registered offices and the Statute of the European Private Company .
<en> Mr McCreevy has told us in his reply that there are some problems , that there has been a delay , that consultations have been launched on one of the proposals and that for the other no point of view has apparently been defined as yet .
<en> So we are faced with the familiar issue of the adoption of Community legislation and the improvement of Community rules .
<en> Mr Lehne has made it clear that the atmosphere here is one of cooperation between the institutions : Parliament is not on one side and the Commission on the other .
<en> Parliament hopes that the Commission can present initiatives soon because the Commission 's power of initiative is part of the framework for cooperation with the other institutions .
<en> Commissioner McCreevy has spoken about difficulties with regard to the Member States but it is still not clear to us as a result of this debate where the objections lie , and whether they come from the private sector proper or essentially from the Member States .
<en> Which States are opposed to Community rules of this type being adopted ?
<en> Are we talking of solely private opposition ?
<en> As Mr McCreevy will have another opportunity to speak I hope he will be able to offer some further clarification as to where the difficulties lie , whether in the private sector or essentially with the Member States .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - I wish to thank all Members for their comments .
<en> I am afraid I cannot agree with Mr Gargani when he said that the Commission has not done anything and that it ignored Parliament .
<en> When we discussed Parliament 's resolution on 1 February 2007 in Brussels , I undertook to answer Parliament in detail and I have every intention of living up to that commitment .
<en> I also noted the request from a number of Members , during our debate on 1 February , not to ignore preparatory work .
<en> Consultation on the EPC was duly launched in July .
<en> There is some support amongst stakeholders for a European Private Company .
<en> But it would be wrong to assume that there is consensus on its possible content , as both Mr Titley and Mrs Bowles have illustrated .
<en> Jumping to a conclusion risks parking the proposal on the shelf before it even gets started .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , simplifying the legislation must not result in consumers ' rights being reduced .
<en> What we must do is not only maintain those rights in the current legislation - including in relation to financial services - but also improve them in those cases which are not sufficiently covered , such as the areas of telecommunications and energy .
<en> As stressed in the proposals made by my group , any horizontal instrument in this area must focus on defining a limited set of general rules common to all vertical consumer protection instruments .
<en> This would ensure a high level of consumer protection with the approved method of minimum harmonisation being used , combined with the country of destination principle , so as not to compromise existing national legislation .
<en> It would be unacceptable for a consumer rights directive to return to any country of origin principle as a general rule , as was attempted in the initial version of the directive on liberalisation of services .
<en> The consumer 's freedom to choose the most favourable legislation must prevail .
<en> However , the report presented contains several contradictions which must be rectified by the amendments on which we are to vote .
<en> In this way we can protect the essential principle of guaranteeing that the binding general rules on the protection of consumers ' rights respect the rights that exist in each country and do not prevent these rights from possibly being improved .
<en> In fact , they must be capable of promoting and improving all existing rights .
<en> The opportunity should also be taken to apply the rules on unfair terms to all negotiated contracts which contain unfair terms , even if they have been individually negotiated .
<en> Rules governing the direct liability of producers must also be maintained for those cases where the contracts do not ensure consumer protection .
<en> That is what we are trying to achieve .
<en> If this is not achieved , as already stated , we will vote against the report .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I welcome very much the work done by Ms Patrie and my colleagues on the committee in producing an extremely well-balanced and clear report for the Commission .
<en> I am sure that is really going to help Ms Kuneva move forward as quickly as possible with the proposal for the first stages of the so-called ' horizontal directive ' .
<en> I particularly want to thank Ms Patrie for her contribution to this .
<en> I have worked with her in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on consumer protection issues for many years .
<en> She has great expertise , which I think has worked through in this .
<en> I am sorry we will not be seeing quite so much of her , but this report shows her commitment to this area .
<en> I also want to thank the Commissioner for her energetic promotion of consumer protection and the profile she is giving to this .
<en> Mrs McCarthy referred specifically to issues surrounding products and toys .
<en> They are not part of this debate , but we will have a chance to discuss them with the Commissioner at the committee meeting next week .
<en> I want to mention a previous piece of work we were all involved in that has not been mentioned so far , which is the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive .
<en> That was a landmark piece of consumer protection legislation , because , for the first time , it set out the harmonised rules on unfair commercial practices to be applied across the European Union .
<en> In many countries , that whole area of dealing with unfair practices was not really developed at all in national legislation .
<en> A number of colleagues have referred to the issue of compliance , and let us not forget that is a foundation which is still being transposed in many Member States , including the United Kingdom .
<en> So we have to keep the pressure up on this , along with the follow-up to the Green Paper .
<en> I want to highlight the fact that the Commissioner has a clear direction from this Parliament , which I am sure she will have in the vote today , to move quickly on the horizontal directive - we have clear agreement on that .
<en> There are , clearly , other areas we wish to debate , particularly the issue of cost and compliance with different standards in different markets .
<en> Let us not forget that , on the one hand , we want to ensure consumer confidence - as the Commissioner highlighted in her speech - and for consumers to feel that they have a well-developed set of rights that are really meaningful .
<en> But , at the same time , we want to encourage innovative , new businesses to come and put products and services onto the market and not to be discouraged by the legal regime they are faced with .
<en> I have to say that on some of the issues - and I have raised this with the Commissioner - that are being talked about in other areas , on the reform of Rome I , for example , small businesses are extremely concerned about the potential costs of compliance with extensive requirements under 27 jurisdictions .
<en> If we provide high levels of consumer protection but we discourage companies from entering those markets , then we are not doing consumers a favour .
<en> That is the balance we intend to seek .
<en> I was delighted that the Commissioner specifically mentioned that mutual recognition will be an important part of this .
<en> On the unfair commercial practices , we argued for an internal market clause and it was voted through .
<en> We have been entirely consistent for this side .
<en> That is part of the balance that we seek and I am confident that we can achieve it .
<sp>
<en> ( DA ) Mr President , I should like to express my warmest thanks to Mrs Patrie for her hard work , and also my thanks to the Commission .
<en> The Green Paper is a very good tool for identifying problems in , and seeking solutions to , the consumer acquis .
<en> One of the solutions proposed by Mrs Patrie is a combined approach to the consumer acquis involving full harmonisation in the cross-cutting definitions and minimum harmonisation at sector level .
<en> I can understand this approach , and I also support it .
<en> In my view , however , we also need to ensure that harmonisation of consumer acquis does not lead to a decline in the level of protection of any consumers whatsoever .
<en> Accordingly , when we discussed the matter in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I submitted a proposal concerning what is known as a ' consumer protection guarantee ' .
<en> Unfortunately , the proposal was defeated in the vote in committee , but now the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has resubmitted it so that we can vote on it here in plenary .
<en> The point of this proposal is to give all European consumers a safeguard , or guarantee , that the rights already obtained will not be at risk even in the case of full legislative harmonisation .
<en> I believe that this is crucial in building consumer confidence in the EU , and in fostering an appreciation of why we are making common EU rules .
<en> After all , we do need common rules in a number of areas , among other things to keep pace with the growth and development of the volume of trade on the Internet , for example .
<en> As a matter of fact , it is widely held among the public of some Member States that their own particular country has the very highest level of consumer protection .
<en> Denmark is one such country , and thus all EU measures in the field of consumer legislation are regarded with apprehension .
<en> Purely and simply , the public fears a lowering of standards .
<en> It is my deep conviction that the introduction of a consumer protection guarantee - that is , a guarantee that no one will be in a less favourable position in the future than he or she is today - really will enable us to both allay these fears and foster an appreciation that it makes sense to pass Community legislation , too .
<en> This will be only at the highest level , not at the lowest .
<en> Consequently , I would urge everyone to vote in favour of our proposal No 4 during voting time later today .
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Madam President , according to the Eurobarometer survey , half of the citizens of the EU are warier of making cross-border purchases than domestic purchases .
<en> More than 70 % think that related problems , such as complaints , are difficult to solve when shopping cross-border .
<en> A clear majority of consumers feel uncertain of their position on the dance floor of trade .
<en> As a result there is no new shopping and the economy and the prosperity of consumers relying on it do not grow as much as they could .
<en> The Commission says that the ideal situation would be if EU consumers could have the same basic rights wherever they were in the Union and wherever they did their shopping .
<en> These are nice dreams , but now we need sensible action .
<en> Attitudes change slowly and only if the reality of a situation improves .
<en> For now reality is harsh and , for example , with many chain stores , faulty goods can only be returned to the original place of purchase , even if the chain has shops in the place or country where the consumer actually lives .
<en> The consumer must be king .
<en> Consumer law should actually protect consumers .
<en> The laws therefore need to be brought up to date , harmonised and , in part , expanded .
<en> It is odd , for example , how the long arm of EU law does not automatically extend to on-line auctions .
<en> The level of consumer protection at national level must not be allowed to fall because of EU laws .
<en> Finally , attention needs to be focused on improving the quality of information and education for consumers .
<en> There are a lot more opportunities today for businesses to lobby for their rights and be aware of them and their obligations , as well as the rights and obligations of the consumer .
<en> Without consumers and their trust there is no trade anyway .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to express my warm thanks to Mrs Patrie and above all to our shadow rapporteur , Kurt Lechner , whose comments in this debate I completely endorse .
<en> In my view , Commissioner , the decision-making process and the submission of your Green Paper are an exemplary model of good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission , highlighting that we need this kind of effective cooperation in other areas as well .
<en> What we are dealing with here , with this more technical report , is the interface between European consumer legislation and European internal market legislation , because on the one hand , we have the development of the common frame of reference , where until now , not enough texts have been available .
<en> The issues which have been raised are Rome I , the regulation in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Europe 's consumer acquis .
<en> I believe that these measures must always be viewed in relation to each other so that in the end we have a coherent and unified law which - as other speakers have already mentioned - is transparent for the consumer .
<en> However , transparency for the consumer does not in every case necessarily mean - as Mr Lechner has already stated - that we should mix up all the highest standards from every Member State into a kind of European hotch-potch ; instead , we really should be considering at European level which targeted strategy we need to deploy in order to provide the European consumer with clear and coherent European consumer legislation .
<en> The proposal for a ' blue flag ' for the European consumer , for the purchaser , may have its appeal , but I believe that it would of course be even more important and even better for the internal market if we could successfully guide the Member States along a unified course in their national legislation .
<en> This brings me to the issue of minimum and maximum harmonisation .
<en> I believe - as some of my colleagues from my group have already said - that we must be cautious in our arguments .
<en> The internal market thrives on the fact that the consumers can depend on what they perceive to be valid legal norms .
<en> Of course , that only holds good if these legal norms apply everywhere .
<en> I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Gebhardt has said that we need unified definitions of terminology in many areas , for example .
<en> However , I also believe that we must proceed cautiously on other points and that we must make it clear to the Member States that if we want to have a single internal market and unified consumer protection provisions , this cannot work if we adhere to the notion that ' everyone can add a bit on top ' , as that is guaranteed to confuse the consumer .
<en> That is the line that we will pursue in the vote afterwards as well .
<en> Commissioner , the collective data has already been mentioned .
<en> We are very well-disposed towards your activities to benefit the consumer , including as regards the issue of class actions .
<en> However , it must also be clear that in Europe we definitely wish to rule out US conditions , and so we are very keen to see what you intend to present to us in detail , having already outlined some of it in broad terms .
<en> We want to be reassured that you are definitely ruling out US conditions in Europe .
<en> Class action lawsuits - and the PPE-DE Group will itself put forward something here - and test cases are entirely in the consumer 's interest and that is something that we would also support .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Madam President , Commissioner , the European Union cannot base itself only on economic criteria .
<en> Europa should be built on the citizen 's social agenda .
<en> We often cite telephone , transport , financial , medical , and educational services .
<en> We need to define quality criteria for public services .
<en> We cannot develop the European economy if the public transport between two towns does not exist because it is not cost effective .
<en> The new regulation on roaming is a success .
<en> Consumer protection also means that every EU citizen or family has the necessary daily basket ensured .
<en> How can we protect the retired , how can we protect the disabled people or the vulnerable people in an internal market if it relies only on economic criteria ?
<en> Despite the legislation in force , EU citizens , as consumers , do not know how -and implicitly are unable- to defend their rights .
<en> Passengers do not know that theycan do -and implicitly do not request financial compensation in case of delay or cancellation of flights .
<en> I hope that these compensation schemes will be introduced also for other transport means .
<en> I also welcome the rapporteur 's request to draw up a black list of the forbidden clauses and a grey list of the alleged forbidden clauses that may arise when concluding contracts .
<en> Besides , it is imperative that citizens , as consumers , be better informed .
<en> How do we protect a participant in an investment fund from the shareholder 's decision to invest in business types the participant does not agree with ?
<en> Since most of the Europeans consume information society products , I call on the European Commission to draw up a strategy and an action plan as soon as possible for ensuring the security of information society specific systems and services .
<en> I congratulate the rapporteur .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I am trying to organise my speech in the best way to touch upon all the important issues , and I am very thankful for your very valuable input in this debate .
<en> I am also glad that many European citizens are listening to this very important matter for our everyday lives - the so-called ' Green Paper ' , which perhaps sounds a little distant .
<en> But when you realise that we are surrounded by consumer contracts , starting early in the morning when we buy a cup of coffee - this is already a consumer contract - you can see how important what we are debating today is to the citizens ' agenda of the European Union .
<en> I am very grateful that you are all so dedicated to making the language really understandable and close to the citizens .
<en> Let me start with a few remarks about the general issues you touched upon .
<en> Firstly , concerning the scope of the review : I am very sympathetic towards a more open review of the acquis , but we have already stipulated that the Commission agrees that it should , in principle , be limited to the eight directives covered by the Green Paper .
<en> So any legislative follow-up instrument would need to clarify its relationship with other Community instruments .
<en> The Commission will evaluate the need for and the timing of a report on the e-commerce Directive .
<en> I fully agree , when we are talking about means for European consumers , that it is very important to tackle this issue , but this does not really fall within the scope of this review .
<en> Normally , I am very ambitious as a politician and as the Commissioner for Consumer Protection , but I do not believe that we can include the e-commerce Directive within the scope of this revision at the moment .
<en> A number of consumer protection directives , such as Directive 97 / 7 / EC on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts , applies to consumer contracts concluded by electronic means and , indeed , the e-commerce Directive clearly states that it is without prejudice to the level of protection for consumer interests as established by Community acts , including the consumer acquis .
<en> In this respect , the e-commerce Directive can be reviewed separately from the review of the consumer acquis , and I assure you that I will follow this subject very closely with fellow Commissioner McCreevy , within whose portfolio lies the e-commerce Directive .
<en> I also believe that we have achieved a good understanding within the Commission that the consumer dimension should be seen in many other portfolios , not just within the portfolio of the Commissioner for Consumer Protection .
<en> So I am involved in the third energy package , which will be produced by the end of this month ; I am also involved with the internal market review , and Commissioner McCreevy and are co-authors on the financial services review .
<en> I will not drop the very important consumer dimension from my attention .
<en> We also see , from INFSO , the success of the work related to the enhanced consumer confidence in roaming , and this is just the beginning .
<en> Many of you have referred to the level of consumer protection .
<en> Let me reiterate that the Commission 's emphasis on proposals for full harmonisation will be based on a high level of consumer protection .
<en> A ' race to the bottom ' approach is therefore clearly excluded .
<en> However , it is not anticipated that such proposals would be based on the highest level of consumer protection , which has been achieved by some national legislations .
<en> I agree with Ms Wallis that we should have an accessible and understandable set of rules , which means that we will look at how we can implement these rules in all the 27 Member States .
<en> This issue will definitely not be ' raced to the bottom ' .
<en> With due respect to those Member States that exercise best practice , believe me , there is no ideal country in respect to consumer protection .
<en> I have visited half the Member States .
<en> I took stock from the most advanced countries and , again , some of them failed to transpose the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices .
<en> I will show you the scoreboard on the implementation of the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices and you will be surprised that even the champions of consumer protection failed in the transposition of this particular directive .
<en> Concerning the common frame of reference ( CFR ) , as Ms Wallis knows , this project is dear to my heart and the Commission agrees with the European Parliament on the need to ensure coherence between the work on the preparation of the CFR and the review of the consumer acquis .
<en> As the European Parliament correctly points out , it is essential that the review of the acquis is not delayed by CFR work , which is a more long-term project .
<en> I look forward to working on this issue to take more stock of what is the experience , seminar after seminar , but I believe that the Green Paper is a test .
<en> If we achieve the targeted full harmonisation through the Green Paper , this promises that we can work on a good common contractual base for the future .
<en> I really believe in the future of this project .
<en> As regards the need to ensure effective publication of consumer protection rules and adequate information to consumers - points 42 , 43 and 47 - the Commission underlines that the recent initiatives in this area are expected to yield results in the near future .
<en> I would like to draw attention to point 6 ; the application of the future instrument , once adopted , would have to be evaluated in order to assess its effectiveness .
<en> This is very important for better regulation , because , if the best designed legislation remains on paper , it will disappoint citizens , it will be just paper , and we will provoke a more cynical approach towards the efforts of the Commission and of Parliament , so enforcement and implementation scoreboards are really very important .
<en> The Commission is sure that any future proposal following up the Green Paper consultation will be preceded by a thorough impact assessment in accordance with the applicable internal guidelines , also as a part of a better regulation process .
<en> I would like to refer for a while to collective redress , which is very important .
<en> I do not know with what kind of words I could reassure those who are still hesitant that this is not an American-type of class action .
<en> I do not know how these allegations began , that what we are trying to introduce is the American class action ; maybe I need to speak ex cathedra and make a solemn oath .
<en> No , this is not an American class action .
<en> This is our attempt to answer to the needs of the European citizens .
<en> In November there will be a very interesting conference during the Portuguese Presidency on collective redress and , please , if you would like to be instrumental in our future attempts , let us not use the term ' class action ' .
<en> We are talking about collective redress .
<en> By the way , in 14 European Member States , we have collective redress , representative action and group action , as in France etc .
<en> Fortunately , businesspeople are coming around more and more to the idea of collective redress .
<en> I had a very interesting meeting recently with the Mouvement des Entreprises de France .
<en> I was invited there for a big conference , and we are starting to come closer in our positions , so I believe that if we do our work properly , making sure , in a very open and sincere manner , what we are targeting with collective redress , we will finally reach a common solution .
<en> I personally believe in it .
<en> Financial capability and services - an absolutely good and proper point .
<en> The Commission recently held a conference on financial capability issues to generate ideas on what it can do in this area .
<en> The Commission will come forward with a communication on this subject later this year , in which it will set out its views and announce initiatives to encourage and promote the provision of financial education in the Member States .
<en> Again , let me reiterate that I will join my efforts to Commissioner McCreevy 's report on financial services and I will keep the agenda of consumer protection , the citizens ' market , very close to the outcome .
<en> Now to specific issues raised in the Green Paper .
<en> I would like to refer to some of them .
<en> Digital content and software : the Commission agrees that this issue requires further reflection .
<en> As you know , we supported Ms Roithová 's report .
<en> I think this is one of the possible avenues for doing important things right now to raise awareness , but the Commission will launch an information-gathering process in order to determine whether consumers suffer detriment as a result of the lack of coverage of digital content and software .
<en> This process will be separated from the general follow-up to the Green Paper .
<en> Concerning the issue of prolonging the time limit for the legal guarantee , some of you pointed out how important the liability and guarantee is as a process of consumer protection .
<en> The Commission considers that future reflection is required , but takes note of the support for this issue by many respondents to the consultation .
<en> Furthermore , the Commission agrees with the suggestion to maintain the current rules of the burden of proof or the lack of conformity .
<en> The Commission takes note of the European Parliament 's opposition to the introduction of direct producers ' liability .
<en> Further reflection is needed on this issue in view of the mixed views amongst the stakeholders .
<en> I shall refer now to collective redress .
<en> This issue has been raised in Ms Patrie 's report and by Ms Wallis as well .
<en> I agree with Ms Wallis concerning the need to ensure coherence between the work on the preparation of CFR and the review of the consumer acquis , that we will maintain the same speed .
<en> You can rely on my commitment , Ms Wallis , that I will not miss an opportunity to speak about the importance of the CFR in the future .
<en> Mr Lechner also mentioned quite promptly how important coherence is .
<en> It is definitely part of my agenda to assure coherence on the issue of consumer acquis .
<en> Concerning Ms Kallenbach 's remarks on toys : I hope that , on 12 September , if I am not mistaken , at the next meeting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I will have more opportunity to talk about the action taken by the Commission .
<en> I think that we already have some concrete results to discuss .
<en> I went to China ; this problem has not caught us by surprise .
<en> We have our RAPEX system , which is an excellent example of solidarity within the Union , to inform all 27 countries rapidly if a dangerous product is found on our markets .
<en> It works well .
<en> I made quite a strong point when I went to China - immediately after the visit , the two licences were withdrawn from the Chinese producers of the toys .
<en> Yesterday , I had a long conversation on the phone with Mr Eckert , who is CEO of Mattel .
<en> I think that the toys issue and China could be used in explaining why it is so important to have targeted full harmonisation .
<en> It is not enough if consumers are well protected in one country .
<en> We cannot live in islands and this is definitely not the internal market and this is definitely not a united European Union .
<en> Believe me , it is very hard , even the biggest country in the Union , to convince China to act .
<en> If we would really like to have a stronger voice in our talks with China , we need to remain absolutely united with a clear set of rules , not 27 different markets , and also to follow very much enforcement .
<en> The consumer acquis is not the only one tool .
<en> We should see the entire picture .
<en> The acquis is definitely very important ; it is the base and our foundation .
<en> But we also have our consumer strategy for 2007-2013 , and we put a lot of effort into making sure that the enforcement is equally well respected everywhere .
<en> We have our consumer protection cooperation regulation , and at the end of September I invited all the consumer protection authorities to discuss some of the issues and the dangerous goods from the Chinese toy factories .
<en> I will come back to you and report on our stocktaking .
<en> Also , the European consumer centre networks are very instrumental and complementary to what we are achieving as a good legislative base that should be implemented .
<en> Just to refer now to European City Guide .
<en> Yes , I receive a lot of letters about European City Guide .
<en> Unfortunately , on the basis of my prerogatives as Commissioner for Consumer Protection , I cannot do a lot .
<en> I will open my blog with a warning to citizens not to use such kinds of malpractices and be aware of European City Guide 's malpractices , but this is in the hands of the Member States to implement the possible protection .
<en> Enforcement will be very much a key effort in the next months .
<en> I wrote personally to all my counterparts in the Member State Governments to make them aware that unfortunately we are not doing well with transposition of the Directive on unfair commercial practices .
<en> Twenty-seven of my counterparts received personal letters to make them aware that things are not going well .
<en> If we fail with transposition of the acquis , this is a very unstable ground for the future .
<en> The question of Rome I has been raised by Ms Wallis and Mr Lechner .
<en> I can assure you , at this stage , that I do not see any inconsistency between the proposed Rome I regulation and an act which would fully harmonise some aspects of consumer protection or introduce a mutual recognition clause for the other aspects .
<en> But I am at your disposal to continue our discussion on this point .
<en> I know how sensitive it is from the point of view of our consistent efforts in making the legislative base for the Union coherent .
<en> I should like , once more , to thank all of you .
<en> I believe , Ms Patrie , that you have received a lot of recognition for your hard work .
<en> Let me finish by thanking you and saying that I look forward to continuing our work on this very important subject .
<en> Finally , thank you to the European citizens witnessing this debate .

<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) The acquis communautaire on consumer rights has been enriched from one year to another with provisions helping to turn the European single market into reality .
<en> Among the recent legislative acts , the roaming directive indicates that one of the significant barriers to the freedom of movement felt by the European citizen was removed .
<en> The directive on passenger car taxation follows the same route .
<en> Unfortunately a Council decision is still pending from 2005 , although both the Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee gave their favourable opinion last autumn .
<en> This paper is absolutely necessary as , currently , 16 Member States impose a tax at 16 different levels , and this is a barrier for buying a passenger car from another EU Member State .
<en> In most cases , citizens who change their residence from one Member State to another who applying for registration tax happen to pay it twice .
<en> The Parliament and the European Commission have to make efforts for the Ministers of Finance of Member States to adopt this directive in Council .
<en> European citizenship , as a concept , will be full consistent only when all the rights defined in the Treaty are transposed into reality by the European Union and it Member States .

<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , the three reports presented again at third reading as the third railway package are concerned with a variety of very different issues .
<en> The most pressing of these issues is the need for train drivers to be able to stay at the controls when crossing national borders rather than having to hand over to their foreign colleagues .
<en> From the point of view of train crews all three versions had room for improvement .
<en> But my Group is happy with the compromises reached by the rapporteur , Mr Savary , and we shall support version three in the vote .
<en> On passengers ' rights in international rail transport , we have let an opportunity slip .
<en> One area in which the European Union can do something useful is offering maximum safeguards for international rail passengers against the negative effects of competition , unnecessary fragmentation amongst rail operators and national short-sightedness .
<en> The European Commission put forward a good proposal to provide a good long-distance service , as before , in respect of ticket sales and information .
<en> Due to competition and cost-cutting that service is increasingly restricted to individual Member States and their immediate environs .
<en> Germany alone has a good system here and all other railway undertakings would do well to emulate its example .
<en> At Mr Sterckx 's instigation a majority of the House has markedly shifted the emphasis elsewhere .
<en> Far more attention is now being paid to compensation for delays in domestic rail services and far less to the steady deterioration in international services .
<en> In reply to passengers who complain that they waste time unnecessarily because they have to buy another ticket once they have crossed the border , the Commission says that it came up with a good proposal but that the European Parliament blocked it .
<en> Because there is no better alternative at the moment , and because we approve other parts of these proposals , we shall vote in favour of this end result .
<en> We shall continue to press for the improvements which formed the nucleus of the original proposal and which , sadly , are missing .
<en> For my Group , the third part remains the most controversial .
<en> Not only now , but also in the two earlier railway packages Mr Jarzembowski has advocated more competition and the operation of market forces .
<en> That starts with international freight transport , but ultimately encompasses all rail traffic including domestic passenger traffic .
<en> This means that the poorer working conditions in freight transport by road and air also become the norm in rail transport .
<en> My Group thinks it should have been the other way round , leading to better safeguards in and regulation of road and air transport .
<en> We do not agree that competition is a better answer than good cooperation between national railway undertakings to the problems in international freight transport or even passenger transport .
<en> And we shall not be voting for these proposals in the third reading .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , harmonisation of railways across 27 states has very little attraction to the UK .
<en> Competition may be good for commerce , but you can leave us out , as we will deal with the economics of running our own service .
<en> If the standardisation process necessarily involves change of track widths , widths of platforms or changes of voltage on electrified lines , as it will in some parts of the EU , then good luck to you all , but leave us out .
<en> Such is the magnitude of legislation from this place on railways that we will be surprised if a private operator can be found who can jump through all the hoops at anything like economic cost .
<en> We have only one rail link with the continent and this passes through a very useful tunnel .
<en> Bearing in mind that we are all being railroaded by these directives due to one single tunnel , it may lead some to say that the Channel Tunnel should be concreted up in the middle and the British and the French could then use their respective halves for the safe storage of nuclear waste .
<en> This would eradicate the expensive need to harmonise a rail link to the UK , as no rail link would exist .
<en> Please try to control the endless stream of directives from this place .
<en> Or , to put it another way , railways run on sleepers ; what a pity this place does not run on similar lines .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is well known that rail transport has always been the poor relation compared with road transport .
<en> Indeed , with regard to goods traffic , rail has been losing the battle in every country in Europe .
<en> I am pleased to say that the situation today looks set to improve , particularly since the Commission 's decision - as part of the first Railway Package - that at least 40 % of spending on transport should go to the railways .
<en> Infrastructure , in particular , needs to benefit from this spending because all the closures of non-profitable railway lines have resulted in road transport taking over a significant proportion of both freight and passenger traffic .
<en> Of my colleague Dirck Sterckx 's report concerning rail passengers ' rights and obligations I would say that it is essentially sound , focusing as it does on the protection of passengers , with measures including compensation when trains are late , a right to transport for people with reduced mobility , and carrier liability for passengers and their baggage .
<en> However , one point of major importance to all families appears to have been completely lost in this report .
<en> I am talking about the right to reduced ticket prices for large families .
<en> Certain Member States of the Union already have this system whereby a card entitles large families to reductions of between 50 % and 75 % depending on the number of children - France is one example - yet curiously there are no proposals or even plans for such an arrangement in the draft regulation .
<en> However , if we want to step up the development of passenger traffic on the railways , this measure , which is attractive not only financially but also in terms of savings on travel time in comparison with road transport , would undoubtedly give us a strong card in the rail-versus-road battle .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , I do not know if the same sayings are used in other countries , but in Poland people say that the railways are a state within a state , or that no one has yet won a battle with the railways .
<en> It is therefore even more welcome that , after a great deal of work , the third Railway Package is coming into force and that the ordinary citizen will be able to win a battle with the railways , if , of course , they are in the right .
<en> All of this is thanks to the fact that we are approving something that could be called a charter of fundamental rights for the railway passenger , i.e. basic passenger rights .
<en> These include the right to obtain information about one 's rights , which is very important , the right to insurance and compensation and even the right to free movement for the disabled .
<en> This is an issue that requires particular attention and should be carefully monitored .
<en> It should apply equally to small railway stations and to regional ones .
<en> There are of course those among us who would like these rights to be more extensive and less restricted .
<en> We are introducing certain limitations .
<en> I would not , however , like to hide my satisfaction at what we have achieved .
<en> I am certain that , knowing the determination of the European Parliament , we shall not stop at this point and we shall gradually act to extend these rights .
<en> I would like , therefore , to congratulate all the rapporteurs , the members of the Conciliation Committee , the Council and the Commission .
<en> I would like to congratulate them because I believe we have taken a great step forward .
<en> It is an important step , because it is a step forward for the people .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs and everyone in the Council and Commission who helped to secure this outcome .
<en> We have reached the end of a very lengthy process and the result , naturally , is a compromise which does not make anyone a hundred percent happy but does not make anyone a hundred percent unhappy either .
<en> We all want the future for rail transport to be rosy , but we disagree rather on how this is to be achieved .
<en> I would repeat what I have said on this before , namely that I do not see liberalisation alone , always , in all circumstances , as a miracle solution .
<en> On the contrary , in many cases it will bring additional problems , certainly if it interferes with the public service obligation at local or regional level .
<en> What does work - as the railway undertakings in a number of Member States show - is additional investment in comfort , punctuality and attractive pricing , and that of course requires political commitment .
<en> Speaking personally , I am especially glad that we have successfully approved an equally important proposal on the liberalisation of rail passenger transport .
<en> We want to open up the market in international passenger transport and make it more attractive , but without fully liberalising domestic passenger transport .
<en> Opening up the market also means cabotage , but it can be restricted slightly if this cabotage right jeopardises the economic balance of public service contracts .
<en> I know that a majority of my colleagues , admittedly not a qualified majority , were in favour of liberalising national passenger transport but , whilst that might perhaps be problem-free in some countries , I am convinced that in some other situations it most certainly would create problems , not least due to the big differences in the density and structure of rail networks ; so an approach tailored individually to each Member State has to be adopted .
<en> This Directive , in conjunction with the Regulation on public service obligations , will provide a sound legal framework for this kind of customised approach .
<en> On the matter of passengers ' rights it is clear that Parliament was keen , across party lines , to be a little more ambitious and to secure a higher level of rights for all rail passengers Europe-wide .
<en> The fact that this remains de facto impossible for urban and regional transport is regrettable .
<en> It is also unfortunate that long-distance domestic transport can enjoy exemption from this Regulation for up to 15 years , but it is certain that within two years all passengers on international trains will have a number of basic rights and that some Member States will emerge as trendsetters by making good use of the lengthy transitional period .
<en> And we must give every encouragement here : Europe 's mills grind slowly , but they grind .
<en> Little by little we shall improve passengers ' rights .
<en> Bearing in mind what a regulation on passenger rights in air travel has achieved , I urge the Commission to carry out the necessary assessments without undue delay and take any initiatives needed to close any back doors , so that this Regulation does not fail to deliver on its promises .
<en> Lastly , Commissioner , please publicise the content of the regulation promptly and on a wide scale so that all rail passengers are properly informed of the rights they have now acquired .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats voted against Parliament 's report on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector .
<en> Basically we are favourably disposed to a reform of the Community sugar sector .
<en> However , we do not think that Parliament 's proposed amendments add anything positive to the Commission proposal .
<en> We think that they pose the risk of cost increases in a sector of agriculture which is already far too large , something that we Swedish Social Democrats can never support .
<en> In addition , we think that export subsidies for sugar must be completely removed in the long term .
<en> Subsidies which continue to be paid to agriculture should be given in the form of direct aid entirely decoupled from production .
<sp>
<2en> As part of the reform of the common market organisation for sugar , the European Union wanted to help refineries adapt to the restructuring of the European sugar industry by granting EUR 150 million in ' transitional aid ' .
<2en> I was delighted with this initiative , which among other things should help the Saint-Louis Sucre refinery in Marseille meet the new conditions on the sugar market without resorting to job cuts .
<2en> However , I also alerted the competent French and European authorities to the lack of transparency in the criteria for allocating this aid , which is the responsibility of the Member States .
<2en> Currently , this aid is not granted with the intention of maintaining the refining industry or preserving jobs .
<2en> Neither is there any guarantee that this aid will not be used as an ' incentive to relocate ' to countries outside the EU .
<2en> The new reform should have been an opportunity to clarify this point .
<2en> Regrettably , this has not been the case .
<2en> The matter is now in the hands of the Council .
<2en> I am calling for greater vigilance from the Council , particularly of the French authorities , so that this issue , which affects the jobs of our fellow citizens can finally be clarified .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) The June List supports a radical reform of the sugar markets in the EU with a view to liberalising them as quickly as possible and giving sugar-producing countries outside the EU the chance to compete on fair terms .
<en> The amendments proposed by the European Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs in this report are nothing more than a further attempt to impede the rate of reform as much as possible so that a protectionist trade policy can continue .
<en> The amendments would also mean an increase in the cost of the industrial restructuring of existing refineries which the reform would involve , at the same time as more generous direct compensation to players on the sugar market .
<en> The June List can never give its backing to a report which frustrates the purposes of reforms to the sugar market in the EU and which would inevitably dilute those reforms as well as jeopardise their completion .
<en> We oppose blatant attempts to renege on commitments which have been made to less developed countries .
<en> For the above-mentioned reasons , therefore , we vote against this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Reality has shown that in this as in other sectors , persuading small growers to renounce quotas and abandon production - as proposed for sugar beet and sugar production - with a view to promoting competition , has adverse effects ; it accentuates development inequalities and will increase poverty and the exodus from the countryside .
<en> We therefore object to the European Commission 's proposals and stress the need to reverse this policy and take account of the specific reality of the Member States and their production needs .
<en> We therefore support food sovereignty and hence consider it unacceptable that a country such as Portugal , with only very limited sugar production , scarcely able to supply half the country 's consumption need should be confronted with the obligation to reduce its quota for sugar produced from sugar beet .
<en> We consider it essential for the liberalising trend seen in successive CAP reforms to be reversed and measures to be taken to maintain national sugar beet production , supporting agriculture that is essentially focused upon food production and thus helping to safeguard the two factories ' production as well as employment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( CS ) The European Union is often justifiably criticised for interfering in a range of industrial sectors .
<en> Particularly controversial is its interference in the affairs of the food processing industry .
<en> It is true that some Member States create their own problems .
<en> A classical example is the strenuous effort by a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe to liquidate cooperative farms even though they are prosperous .
<en> In the Czech Republic several amended laws governing cooperative farming have been trying to achieve exactly this .
<en> Many cooperative farms have fallen apart and others have transformed into different legal entities .
<en> At the same time production has decreased in a range of industries , for example in the sugar beet growing industry .
<en> Furthermore , processing has unfortunately become detached from production as a result of privatisation .
<en> Most sugar factories have been acquired by foreign parties .
<en> This has resulted led to a disastrous situation in the sugar industry in the Czech Republic : the profits end up in the pockets of the foreigners while the losses hit the people of the Czech Republic .
<en> There has been more than a 20 % decrease in sugar production in a country that had been exporting sugar for 150 years .
<en> Now the country must begin to import sugar and at the same time look for new opportunities for the farms that have been growing sugar beet until now .
<en> This untenable situation is not solved by Mrs Katerina Batzeli 's reports ; however , we voted in favour of them because they at least draw attention to the unsatisfactory situation .
<en> I would add a word of warning to those who see today 's texts as a solution to the problem .
<en> I trust that we will return to the sugar issue and that the next time we will be able to respond more successfully to our farmers ' needs .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , I am especially pleased , Commissioner , with the five objectives you have just defined , although as you mentioned afterwards , there will be concrete measures following the consultation , which ends in March .
<en> If you will allow me , Commissioner , I would like to repeat what the members of our Urban Housing Intergroup have pointed out : namely the need to adopt an integrated approach , not only for cities , but also , as you said earlier , for the suburbs .
<en> As part of this integrated approach , bearing in mind that the European Union invests regional funds - the ERDF , ESF and EAFRD , the latter involving both rural and suburban areas - it seems to us that you and your fellow Commissioners need to take these various aspects into account , so that the integrated approach can truly be implemented by cities and municipalities .
<en> Therefore , today I once again call for the integrated approach to be taken into account in this issue of urban transport .
<sp>
<2en> Mr Jarzembowski , these are proposals .
<2en> They are not complete .
<2en> In a box , at the end of each set of questions , we have asked what the role of the European Union should be .
<2en> Therefore , I am not going to predict what the outcome of the debate will be .
<2en> The question is open and in fact it must be demonstrated that there is real European added value .
<2en> We are not going to claim to exercise any sort of supervision over European towns and cities .
<2en> Mr El Khadraoui , I think you hit the nail on the head : we want to make this a political priority .
<2en> I think you voiced my own thoughts on the subject .
<2en> I would like elected officials , by supporting each other and through good practice and sharing the best experiences , to convince their compatriots somehow to engage in these bolder and more environmentally-friendly urban policies .
<2en> Mr Beaupuy rounded off what you said by pointing out that we can only truly succeed with an integrated approach , which effectively means that town planners also have to design towns and cities in a certain way , taking into account future mobility requirements , and specifically the construction of suburban areas : this should not be haphazard .
<2en> I would like to thank Mr Beaupuy in particular , as well as the urban mobility group , which I am sure will make a valuable contribution .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , first of all I would like to express my thanks for the interest in the subject of urban transport .
<en> This is an extremely serious and difficult subject , especially as the EU is concerned with urban policy .
<en> The very raising of the subject at European Commission level in relation to towns shows that we are dealing here with an unusually interesting interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> I am very much in favour of the Commission 's actions in this sphere .
<en> In supporting the Commission 's actions in this sphere , I would like to ask the Commissioner , although perhaps this question is a bit premature , but nevertheless , how are we to understand the arrangement whereby the Commission will implement the principle of partnership in this matter , in other words , what are the possible instruments of partnership ?
<en> Are we talking about an exchange of experience ?
<en> Are we talking about a partner who also in some sense does more than just propose , but actually demands ?
<en> On the back of what Mr Jarzembowski has said , I would also like to ask for support for the Committee on Regional Development having reinforced cooperation with the Committee on Transport and Tourism in this matter .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , many thanks for your speech and for the Green Paper , the details of which we are still not familiar with .
<en> It is true that more and more people are living in cities and conurbations , but there are also , of course , specific problems associated with shrinking cities , which should not be completely disregarded .
<en> My first question is : are they also in our field of vision ?
<en> We have capacity overload in the inner cities , primarily associated with individual private transport resulting in very high emissions , particulates , noise and also safety problems .
<en> Secondly , if we now want to increase public transport , and networking it intelligently plays a crucial role in the solution , the question then arises , of course , whether we will be able to use capital from the Structural Funds for this purpose at all .
<en> Thirdly , as regards the many individual proposals for freight transport logistics and so on : do we also have a forum for exchanging best practice models , in which this exchange can take place in an organised manner ?
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for the report .
<en> You write here that you want to promote alternatives to the car , namely travel by bus , rail , cycling and walking .
<en> However , you also know that 95 % of EU cofinancing , which the cities are asking for , goes solely to road transport .
<en> You are therefore considering whether you should say that at least 50 % must in future go to these alternatives , because my home city of Berlin argues , for example , that EU funds should not be spent on local public transport .
<en> I think that is mad !
<en> If you do not change the funding , you will never be successful .
<en> Therefore , how do you want to ensure that the EU 's alternatives can be considered in future ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> deputising for the author . - ( EL ) Commissioner , I would like to ask if you have received a specific draft plan for the reconstruction of the regions affected by fire .
<en> What will the procedure be for approving such a plan ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - As I mentioned , you have two possibilities within the programmes .
<en> Within the rural development programme , it is possible to find support for reconstruction to buy , as I said , new olive trees and new wine stocks .
<en> Then you have the regional policy , which falls within the responsibility of my colleague Commissioner Hübner .
<en> I know that there is a direct link and very good contact where Commissioner Hübner has been nominated to hold the ropes .
<en> I am sure that lots of constructive discussions are ongoing .
<en> Subject : Funding for research
<en> Which sectors of research does the Commission consider are lagging behind in funding provision under the plans for the programming period 2007 - 2013 ?
<en> What criteria determine the priorities for funding ?
<en> How does assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of the research that was funded under the sixth research framework programme influence the selection of new research projects ?
<en> What criteria determine the priorities for funding in each research sector ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , it is good to be here again .
<en> I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question concerning the funding for research .
<en> Her question refers clearly in the first instance to research funded by the European Union and in my answer I shall deal with these aspects .
<en> However , the need for increased investment in research at national as well as European level , private even more than public , is central to achieving the Lisbon goals .
<en> At the same time we have to make sure that this money is well spent to ensure the maximum effect .
<en> The question is essentially in four parts and I shall reply to each of them in turn .
<en> At the same time , we must bear in mind that it is still very early to draw definitive conclusions and lessons from the sixth and seventh framework programmes .
<en> But before turning to the four aspects of the honourable Member 's question , I should like to recall that European Union cohesion policy , especially the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund , also makes an important contribution to the development of the European research area .
<en> The Commission estimates that cohesion policy support for research and innovation will more than triple in the programming period 2007-2013 compared to 2000-2006 .
<en> Turning to the first element of the question , what are the sectors of research that the Commission considers to be lagging behind in funding provisions under the plans 2007-2013 ?
<en> The Commission believes that it has a good balance between the more top-down thematic areas in the programme and other , more bottom-up activities in framework programmes , such as frontier research and fellowships .
<en> It would not be appropriate to single out specific areas in particular need of funding .
<en> The closer you look at our 10 thematic priorities , the clearer it is that we need more funding and more research in practically all of them .
<en> But , to give you an example , I could mention the research infrastructures of pan-European interest , for which the final budget in Framework Programme 7 is much less than the Commission had originally proposed .
<en> This is an important area where we have real added value in Europe .
<en> We are seeking to combine funding from many sources , especially from national and regional sources and the European Investment Bank .
<en> It is also evident , following the first call for proposals of the European Research Council , that we are faced with serious oversubscription .
<en> We have received many more excellent proposals for fundamental frontier research than we have money to fund .
<en> Looking at thematically orientated research , we can clearly see the need to better support research areas such as energy and climate change .
<en> Here , Member States can help not only by increasing investment in research but also by exploring ways of combining research efforts rather than allowing them to remain fragmented .
<en> This is also one of the areas which we advocated in our Green Paper on the European Research Area .
<en> Turning to the general criteria , the thematic priorities for funding are set out in the Cooperation Specific Programme .
<en> These research areas are the ones which will be supported through calls for proposals during the 2007-2013 period .
<en> Our proposal was made after an extensive consultation with stakeholders during 2004 , including a web-based consultation on the cooperation themes as well as input from industrial stakeholders through the European Technology Platforms .
<en> It was also based on an extensive ex-ante impact assessment .
<en> Results from ex-post evaluation and monitoring exercises also form an important element in determining the priorities for research funding .
<en> This learning from past experience was indeed a key element in defining the priorities in the Framework Programme , as you suggest in the third part of your question to which now I turn .
<en> You asked how assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of the research that was funded under the sixth framework programme influenced the selection of new research projects .
<en> Here we have to distinguish two different ways of making that link .
<en> First , at the more detailed , operational level , we should note that the several thousand FP6 projects are monitored by the Commission services .
<en> These colleagues are in frequent contact with the research community and their up-to-date insight into the progress achieved within this project is an important element in preparing the Framework Programme 7 work programmes .
<en> But , in the second place , at a more global level , in 2008 the Commission will organise the ex-post evaluation of FP6 .
<en> This assessment of the overall impact of the different research activities will be carried out by high-level experts .
<en> The results of this FP6 ex-post evaluation will be a major input in the forthcoming mid-term review of FP7 in the year 2010 .
<en> Finally , turning to the last part of the question , when considering the priorities for funding in each research sector , the topics to be funded are specified in the annual work programmes and the call for proposals .
<en> Each year , we undertake consultation with the right variety of stakeholders in drawing up the work programmes .
<en> We also call on the assistance of external advisory groups , key specialists in the area , who provide input on ensuring that the work programmes contain the most essential areas of research , taking into account ongoing projects that have been funded in previous calls for proposals .
<en> Once the individual proposals have been received in response to the calls , they are evaluated by expert peer reviews using a standard set of evaluation criteria .
<en> The proposals funded are those which receive the highest overall mark for the call or part of the call they address .
<en> In conclusion , I believe that it is fair to say that for research funded through Community instruments we have a transparent system which allocates funding to the most relevant areas and also ensures it is then awarded to the best proposals .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Thank you for your rather informative reply .
<en> I should like to ask whether international progress in research is taken into consideration when decisions are made on various actions , seeing that we live in a globalised world .
<en> To what extent do young people in Europe receive special funding for participation in research ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Of course there is no other way than to look at the global context .
<en> If you look in practice at what other major communities around the world are focusing their research on , then it is the same as ours .
<en> More than that , we do combine our efforts in many areas .
<en> One of the things we really strengthened in the seventh Framework Programme was precisely international cooperation .
<en> We are funding and supporting that , and will do so more in the future , because we believe that in the world of globalisation the challenges which lie ahead of us - be it food , health , drinking water , climate change , security or energy - are global and it is for us all to deal with them in the proper way .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , Europe is facing two challenges .
<en> On the one hand we see ageing and a demographic decline .
<en> On the other hand hundreds of thousands , even millions of people from developing countries , anxious to enter either legally or illegally , are knocking on the southern and eastern gates of the Union .
<en> This challenge has to be addressed in the European Union through joint efforts : no country , regardless of how big it is , can solve this on its own .
<en> I therefore welcome the Commission 's efforts to seek and propose joint solutions , such as using Frontex to prevent illegal migration .
<en> Another example is managing legal immigration through the Blue Card system or through cooperative agreements with the countries of origin .
<en> I also welcome today 's repeated appeal by Commissioner Frattini to those countries of the European Union that have not yet opened up their labour markets to their fellow citizens from the new Member States to do so as soon as possible .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will be brief .
<en> This was certainly one of the fullest , most detailed and all-encompassing debates that I have had the honour of chairing , attending and participating in within the Council and this Parliament .
<en> It was a debate in which I noted and from which I have naturally taken various suggestions , advice and proposals which in my opinion are extremely important and essential to the work that we must do in the future .
<en> In light of all this , I feel that I can legitimately conclude that the European Union has a coherent and comprehensive strategy for tackling the issues of migration and that it is well on the way to implementing policies which will give physical and practical form to this strategy .
<en> Of course there will be some hesitations , some doubts certainly and also of course the need to be a bit more ambitious but , I must stress , everything will be balanced within the context in which we live and according to the difficulties facing us .
<en> I feel that we are on the right road and that we can , and must , move forward with determination to implement a truly global approach to migration .
<en> In our opinion , two essential words form the basis of this policy , humanity and solidarity : humanity because this policy is based on the people and is aimed at the people .
<en> This issue of humanity cannot be and is never forgotten by the presidency .
<en> As has been said , we are talking about people who , by seeking to enter our societies , are legitimately striving for a better life for themselves and for their families .
<en> This is a human desire and wish that we must fully respect .
<en> The other essential word is solidarity because , as has been said , this is not an issue or a problem that can be solved by only one Member State , or even by two or three .
<en> It is a problem that affects everyone and that therefore has and must have a joint response .
<en> Fortunately , we believe that there is an increasingly apparent awareness of the need to bring together these two concepts - humanity and solidarity - when defining and implementing European migration policies .
<en> We have already set up a joint instrument for fighting illegal immigration , an agency known as Frontex , which has been in existence for two years .
<en> Over this period it has been taking its first steps and , in our opinion , despite some difficulties , has acquitted itself well .
<en> Clearly we must increase our efforts to equip it with the instruments needed so that it can achieve the purpose for which it was created more effectively , quickly and accurately .
<en> However , we consider that this collective instrument has so far given a good indication that its creation was necessary and right .
<en> In the context of legal migration , mention has very rightly been made here today of the need to increase our dialogue with third countries , specifically those countries which are the source of migration flows .
<en> This dialogue is absolutely fundamental and , as has been said , I fully agree that , without considering , analysing and in some way attacking the causes which , in these countries of origin , are at the root of these migration flows , we will never be able to find a permanent solution to this problem .
<en> We have stepped up dialogue in this area with Africa and we hope that at the next Europe-Africa summit very important results may be achieved , and ultimately legal migration , in the context of migration and dialogue on migration with the countries of origin .
<en> The Portuguese Presidency has put legal migration high among the action priorities of its agenda for its six-month term .
<en> The Commission has also been active in this area and has tabled proposals we regard as very interesting .
<en> These will be discussed during our presidency , when we hope , as I have said , to be able to make significant progress .
<en> To sum up , despite the difficulties , despite the tough problems that we must face , we feel that we are on the right road .
<en> Here and there perhaps , we must be a bit more ambitious .
<en> Here and there perhaps , we must be a bit quicker , but I feel that no one of good faith can deny that a great deal has been done in recent years .
<en> Of course the Council welcomes and encourages this debate with the European Parliament .
<en> The issue of codecision and the Reform Treaty was raised here today .
<en> As you know , the Reform Treaty has its roots in a mandate that was approved by the European Council and therefore by all the Member States .
<en> Decisions of this type must be taken by all the Member States , not just the presidency of course .
<en> In any event , I believe that the Reform Treaty , like the Constitutional Treaty , takes extremely important steps towards extending the codecision process to many legislative initiatives within the EU .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too am grateful to everyone who has spoken in this extremely important debate .
<en> I believe that Europe must be truly united in its approach to this global phenomenon which involves millions of children , women and men and affects all continents .
<en> First of all , it has been said - and I agree - that we must combat unlawful conduct by taking action against traffickers and those who exploit illegal immigrants , and by means of a repatriation policy that is both credible and fully respectful of individual rights , of the dignity of every human being .
<en> The European Union has already undertaken some repatriation activities and may continue to do so .
<en> I would recall that repatriation initiatives are often delegated to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , so as to ensure maximum transparency in our respect for human rights .
<en> I believe that a European policy has to link aid , respect for human rights , trade policy with Africa and immigration .
<en> I very much agree with Mr Watson 's wise words about those countries : ' we take their goods or we take their people ' .
<en> We must reflect on this , especially because the strategy must be a global one and cannot exclude trade relations or our policy of development aid to Africa .
<en> External border controls are also vital .
<en> Some of you have referred to them ; some have expressed doubts .
<en> I believe that Frontex deserves support .
<en> It deserves support because , as happened this summer , not only have human lives been saved that would otherwise have been lost , but the Frontex officials have arrested a large number of people : 400 people , members of trafficking organisations , have been caught and handed over to the authorities .
<en> This is a large number because it relates only to the past summer .
<en> I therefore hope that this House will recognise the need to give Frontex additional resources in the 2008 budget .
<en> I know there is an amendment seeking to freeze as much as 30 % of Frontex 's operating costs with immediate effect .
<en> I do hope this proposal will be reconsidered and that the budget will instead be increased , subject to monitoring and a fully responsible attitude to expenditure .
<en> There have of course been many references to economic migration .
<en> The detailed proposal I shall make about a European work permit certainly does not mean that we will decide in Brussels how many immigrants are needed in each country .
<en> That will remain the responsibility of each country 's national government and national market , so I wish to reassure all those who have questions or concerns about this .
<en> In other words , each Member State will be free to decide how many of each category of non-Community workers it needs .
<en> However , ladies and gentlemen , one thing Member States will not be able to do is to say ' we do not need any at all ' and then carry on tolerating illegal immigration and the exploitation of undeclared employment .
<en> That is not possible because there will be European rules .
<en> Immigration naturally brings us to a universal value , which some of you have mentioned : mobility among peoples .
<en> I believe that there are opportunities , but also rights .
<en> Rights are always accompanied by duties .
<en> A policy relating to rights but not duties would be unthinkable .
<en> We cannot and would not wish to impose our European laws or funding on anyone else unless our counterparts agree .
<en> This is something we must make crystal clear : our idea , our policy , is partnership .
<en> It is that of a large-scale pact with the countries from which immigrants come and through which they transit .
<en> Such a pact should include - and this is a key component - total respect on our territory for our laws , for fundamental rights and for our most absolute and universal values : life , the dignity of every woman and every man , respect for the individual .
<en> This brings me to integration .
<en> Integrating immigrants means showing respect for their background and religion , because they are a source of enrichment for every one of us , but it also entails respect from them for our traditions , our background , our culture and our religion .
<en> That is why , as I see it , integration means participation .
<en> Quite frankly , we cannot integrate by law those who do not wish to integrate , those who are not prepared to move forward , those who think that Europe can still tolerate forced marriages or polygamy .
<en> Such things are not acceptable because we have our laws and our universal values .
<en> This , then , means education , it means language-learning , it means vocational training , and it means regular employment and the rejection of anything unlawful .
<en> It means taking a firm stance on unlawfulness .
<en> Someone expressed this thought , with which I particularly agree : immigrants who commit crimes are the worst enemies of honest immigrants who work and earn their living normally .
<en> The reason is that we have to explain this policy to our citizens who are full of concern : they should not be afraid of immigration as such , but of those who commit crimes .
<en> It is our duty to ensure that people who commit crimes are punished , because otherwise we do not draw a distinction for our citizens and we fail to address this fear , this concern which then turns into racism and becomes xenophobia , a dreadful but growing phenomenon within the European Union .
<en> To conclude , Mr President , politicians have to make choices .
<en> I believe that our choice must be to establish a global pact of rights and duties among equals , among counterparts .
<en> There should not be one side laying down conditions and the other accepting them ; nor should anything be imposed on us that we find unacceptable .
<en> This is what is needed because we are talking about the dignity and rights of human beings .
<en> We are talking neither about an economic remedy nor about a bureaucratic remedy .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon )
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Illegal immigration is a somewhat paradoxical notion .
<en> I grew up under a political system in which certain terms were deemed to be a priori positive or negative by those in power and their propaganda .
<en> For instance , international was classed as positive but cosmopolitan as negative .
<en> We must guard against falling into a similar semantic trap .
<en> Since xenophobia is bad , one can hardly consider that it is a very good thing for a country or the European Union to protect itself against illegal immigration .
<en> It is surely more of a necessary evil .
<en> I saw the words ' Nobody is illegal ' painted on a wall in my home town of Poznań .
<en> It is sometimes worth pausing to consider whether a human being can actually be illegal .
<en> It is not only on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean that people put their lives at risk attempting to cross the Union 's borders .
<en> Last week a Chechen woman and her three young daughters died on the border between Ukraine and Poland .
<en> They were fleeing from the tragedy that has befallen their homeland .
<en> It is hardly surprising that people are trying to escape from Chechnya , and are even prepared to risk their lives to do so .
<en> The presence of several million immigrants in Europe , who entered the Union illegally , is a very real problem .
<en> As we strive to resolve it , however , we must keep in mind the universal values that underpin European integration .
<en> We must also remember that immigration itself is not a negative phenomenon , for the very simple reason that no human being is a negative phenomenon .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , 85 % of unskilled immigrants from the developing world live in the European Union and only 5 % go the USA , while a mere 5 % of highly skilled immigrants arrive in the countries of the old continent , and more than half are snatched up by the US economy .
<en> I am delighted that Mrs Gruber 's report seeks , among other things , to halt and reverse this process .
<en> I think we must find ways of attracting highly skilled labour , but at the same time we must also prevent the ' brain drain ' from developing countries .
<en> The term ' highly skilled labour ' should therefore be defined and common criteria for training should be standardised and established within the European Union .
<en> This time I do not support the Commission in its application of the principle of ' the more the merrier ' , and I agree that the five directives should merged .
<en> Less bureaucracy will also prove more attractive to skilled workers .
<en> Prior to drafting the directive ( s ) I suggest that an initial impact assessment should be carried out that also takes social factors into account .
<en> This assessment could help to ensure that by representing the real interests of citizens , the legislation being devised will save the European Union millions of euros .
<en> The proposal by Mr Frattini concerning the introduction of packages of legal-entry quotas could , I think , facilitate a reduction of illegal migration within the European Union , but it could also result in more effective control over illegal migration in third countries .
<en> Instead of the EU green card proposed in the report , I believe the new blue card scheme is more likely to succeed in achieving what we hope for concerning legal immigration .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I fully support this excellent report and would like to add three comments of my own on the subject .
<en> Firstly , we have to rid ourselves of the illusion that an active policy on legal immigration will put a stop to the illegal flow of migrants into our countries .
<en> An active policy on legal immigration will , by definition , be determined by our own needs , whereas illegal immigration will correspond to the needs of those - and there are currently tens of millions of such people , mainly in Africa - who want to move here to escape war , persecution , poverty or , quite simply , the lack of future prospects for themselves and their children .
<en> Secondly , the control of the EU 's external borders and the fight against networks of illegal immigrant smugglers will unfortunately remain a political priority for many years to come because in reality the trade in human misery is in the hands of criminal gangs .
<en> The fight against illegal immigration is therefore not directed ' against ' the illegal immigrants as such : it is part of the battle against organised crime , which is something we have to win together .
<en> Thirdly and finally , we must at the same time maintain our relentless efforts to combat poverty and this can only be done through co-development in Africa .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I welcome the adoption of this report , which presents a balanced and realistic view of the issue of immigration and has achieved a broad consensus , as the rapporteur hoped .
<en> The report has come just at the right time when you look at the latest events and see the Member States try , one by one , to adapt their legislation to cope as best they can with the influx of migrants .
<en> In reality we all know that the scale of the migration phenomenon exceeds the capability of the countries concerned to control these events individually and that a global and coherent approach is therefore needed at European level , as the report rightly states .
<en> The text sets out a number of priorities : combating the trafficking of human beings , respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms when applying measures to prevent illegal immigration , strengthening cooperation with third countries , taking the firm steps that are required to combat illegal employment and , finally , the need for a responsible return policy .
<en> For these reasons I supported the adoption of the report during the final vote in plenary .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Despite containing certain points with which we agree , this report also assumes the repressive security-oriented view of ' illegal immigration ' .
<en> Although less so with regard to certain aspects , the report advocates developing the main axes of the current EU guidelines and decisions on immigration , including : the so-called ' European return policy ' or , in other words , repatriation ; the activity of Frontex in terms of border patrol and control ; the so-called ' temporary reception centres ' ; the development of biometric tools , or the so-called ' readmission agreements ' .
<en> The report also proposes setting up ' European patrols ' , a ' European monitoring system ' at the sea borders and even a system for ' automated checks on persons entering or leaving Union territory ' .
<en> In other words , the report aims to reinforce the EU 's security-oriented policy of criminalising ' illegal immigration ' by turning it into a common European policy which is repressive , involves sinister information systems and includes measures and infrastructure for the detention and expulsion of immigrants .
<en> We wholeheartedly reject this .
<en> It was the application of a repressive policy like this which led to the authorities of a Member State prosecuting seven Tunisian fishermen for having saved 44 people at sea , despite this action complying with international maritime law .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The official figures are evidence of it : Europe is being inundated with illegal immigrants .
<en> It has proved to be completely incapable of controlling its external borders .
<en> The annual report presenting the activities of Eurodac in 2006 , which is the biometric tool that Europe uses for monitoring asylum applications , shows that the number of persons recorded as having illegally crossed one of Europe 's external borders is up 64 % on 2005 .
<en> The report presented by Mr Moreno puts forward a number of approaches that are supposed to put an end to this phenomenon , which is growing exponentially .
<en> I think they are all as useless as each other , not to say counterproductive .
<en> For example , how can we be happy with the idea that to encourage legal immigration , and to do so mainly by means of the European Blue Card , which would essentially be a European work permit for immigrants , will reduce the level of illegal immigration ?
<en> That is idiotic .
<en> If you open the doors to some , you are opening them to everyone .
<en> What is the point of setting up a biometric database to combat illegal immigration ?
<en> Why plan to allocate more manpower and resources to the European border control agency , Frontex , when the borders in question , whether internal or external , are still not being properly protected by the Member States ?
<en> Once again the European authorities have succeeded in identifying a problem but have proved incapable of resolving it , carried along as they are by an ideology based on ' immigrationism ' and internationalism .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , immigration , both legal and illegal , has been recognised as one of the main challenges confronting the European Union .
<en> Quite apart from the procedural and legal issues , the tragic human dimension of this phenomenon is becoming increasingly manifest .
<en> I have visited centres for African refugees in Malta , and discussed matters with the services patrolling the Mediterranean and the responsible officials .
<en> It was while I was there that the news of the tragedy that befell that Chechen family in the Bieszczady region came to light , confirming the universal nature of this phenomenon .
<en> Hailing as I do from a country that was for centuries a source of political and economic emigration , it is hard to remain indifferent to the tragedy of refugees for whom the Union is a promised land .
<en> It is from that perspective that I consider the two reports on which the debate in the European Parliament is based .
<en> These documents provide an overview of the scale of the problem of immigration and of the current state of Community policy in this regard .
<en> I agree with the premise that because of its demographic situation , Europe needs controlled channels of immigration that could compensate for the shortfall in the labour force and also reduce the scope of the underground economy and its associated problems .
<en> All these issues have been recognised by Frontex , the Union 's specialist agency .
<en> The proposed solutions , namely the so-called ' burden sharing ' merit serious consideration .
<en> The advent of a Community immigration policy with a sound legal and financial basis is long overdue .
<en> Better late than never !

<en> The next item is the report by Tomáš Zatloukal , on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education , on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( CS ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is facing a number of connected socioeconomic challenges : the emergence of highly competitive countries , the ageing of the population , migration , a fast-changing labour market structure , and booming information and communication technologies .
<en> Each one of these factors affects the issue of access to quality education .
<en> People with low qualifications are increasingly at risk of unemployment and social exclusion .
<en> Fair systems guarantee that education and training are independent of socioeconomic background and other factors that place individuals at a disadvantage .
<en> The challenge is to support the participation of pupils , students and adults from all social groups : the current situation in this regard is particularly unsatisfactory .
<en> The report I am tabling here in this Parliament urges Member States to take positive measures from the pre-school stage to ensure the social diversity of classes and establishments and run quality educational programmes .
<en> Skills that are hereditary or acquired at an early age provide the basis for learning in later life .
<en> The return on investment is highest during this period because the fruit of such investment lasts a lifetime .
<en> I would like to point out that at the level of primary education premature categorisation of pupils has a detrimental effect .
<en> Instead , I consider it important to adapt the curriculum so that it suits diverse groups of children and their capabilities within one school .
<en> On the other hand , differentiation and creating a flexible range of study options is very effective at secondary level .
<en> As far as vocational training is concerned , I would recommend improving access to tertiary education and developing opportunities for lifelong learning .
<en> Third-level education is vital to the success of a knowledge-based economy .
<en> It would benefit from more funding than it receives at present .
<en> The report states that free university tuition does not necessarily guarantee equity and calls for an analysis of the range of financial incentives and support options that can significantly reduce inequity in terms of access to university education .
<en> Education has an impact on the economy : it increases human capital and innovative capability and enables technology to be disseminated .
<en> Each additional year of average school attendance raises productivity in an average EU country selectively by 6.2 % and in the long term by a further 3.1 % , thanks to its contribution to more rapid technological development .
<en> Increasing the efficiency of education and training brings both individuals and society as a whole a return on investment of up to 8 % a year .
<en> A further benefit is a reduction in unemployment : in today 's EU the average unemployment rate is 12.6 % amongst people who have completed primary or secondary education , as against 5 % in the case of people who have completed higher education .
<en> Furthermore , recent research carried out by the Commission has shown that 75 million EU citizens - i.e. 32 % of the workforce - have received insufficient education .
<en> In 2010 only 15 % of new jobs will be available for that group of people , most of whom come from socially disadvantaged sectors of society .
<en> Education and training policies must have a significant positive impact on social and economic results , sustainable development and social cohesion , whereas inefficiency and inequity entail huge costs : loss of tax revenue , unemployment , a greater requirement for healthcare and support from public funds , and also the costs associated with a higher level of anti-social behaviour .
<en> Education and training are basic factors contributing to long-term European economic growth , to competitiveness and to social cohesion .
<en> In conclusion , allow me to thank all my colleagues who have worked with me on this report .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I really welcome this initiative of the Parliament to take further the message of our communication , which we adopted on this topic last year .
<en> I read your report with a lot of interest and I also listened now to Mr Zatloukal , whom I want to congratulate cordially because I think and I feel we are partners on this issue , in this debate and in efforts to improve the situation .
<en> We could listen now to a description of socioeconomic challenges that we are facing individually , collectively , together , but also of the importance of investment - better investment , more investment - in education and training policies .
<en> I think that education and training policy lies at the centre of our efforts to create a more prosperous and a more cohesive European society .
<en> All European education systems are marked by educational inequities that reflect socioeconomic inequalities .
<en> The paradoxical role of education and training in relation to these inequalities is that they very often contribute to their perpetuation .
<en> But they are sometimes the only vehicle by which inequalities can be ameliorated .
<en> Across Europe , the process of modernising education and training systems is largely driven by the search for greater efficiency in terms of cost-effectiveness .
<en> I think this is really desirable , of course , but it is frequently , and wrongly , assumed that efficiency and equity are mutually exclusive .
<en> As part of our commitment to helping Member States improve their education and training systems , the Commission 's communication showed that efficiency and equity do not have to come at the expense of each other , at the expense of quality .
<en> Efficiency and equity are , in effect , mutually enforcing .
<en> I think this is the most important message from the whole communication .
<en> Your report stresses strongly the need for European education and training systems to be both efficient and equitable if they are to help us to achieve not only economic growth but social cohesion .
<en> I am especially pleased to see your emphasis on the need to develop efficient and equitable policies for the whole life-long learning continuum and on the need to invest in education early , as investing in quality early-childhood and pre-primary education and care is shown to be the most effective way of breaking the cycle of disadvantage .
<en> I am also pleased to notice that you confirm our message that early tracking of pupils has detrimental effects on efficiency and equity .
<en> And , of course , you place a lot of emphasis on the need to develop a culture of evaluation in order to develop effective long-term policies and create policies based on solid evidence .
<en> Your initiative will bring us closer to the development of life-long learning strategies that foster equality , inclusion , integration , and social cohesion .
<en> We will take full account of it in our forthcoming initiatives in the field of education and training , especially in the proposal for the 2008 Joint Report on the implementation of our work programme and our reflections for the future , and in the Green Paper on the links between education and migration , in which inequalities will be a central issue .
<en> We hope to present this communication next spring .
<sp>
<en> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality . - ( DE ) Madam President , the question is : why are we talking about equality or inequality when more women than men reach a high level of education ?
<en> What this means is that we have the same educational opportunities and we are utilising them as well , but equality of opportunity is no longer guaranteed after that .
<en> In training , in the use of their acquired knowledge , women continue to suffer discrimination , which means that there is still no equality in the education and training systems .
<en> That is why it is essential that we take account of women who are already mothers and are studying , for example , that we demand particularly flexible organisation of studies here , and that we promote and support access for young women , especially from remote regions , and vulnerable groups such as migrant women and women from ethnic minorities , for there are major anomalies and inequalities here .
<en> This must start at pre-school and school age and then continue all the way through to vocational training .
<en> If I may , I will continue after a short break .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( HU ) Thank you , Madam President .
<en> I will speak in Hungarian .
<en> Commissioner , last week , representing the Committee on Culture and Education , I took part in a conference in Lisbon entitled ' Young Voices - Meeting Diversity in Education ' , organised by the Portuguese Presidency .
<en> It was a profoundly moving experience to hear young people living with a variety of physical and learning disabilities present their school experiences .
<en> There was one common feature in their story : every one of them said that they felt that if they were able to participate in school activities alongside their able-bodied peers , they would not be judged according to their disabilities but according to their abilities and personalities .
<en> Integrating children living with a disability into mainstream education alongside their able-bodied peers is also vital in order to ensure that society accepts them and includes them more easily as adults .
<en> If children are accustomed from an early age to being around children who have some disability or other , and are accustomed to having to respect them equally and perhaps to helping them , then there is a good chance that they will demonstrate more understanding and more empathy towards disadvantaged people in their adult lives .
<en> The report we have before us speaks a great deal about integration issues relating to social differences .
<en> I am convinced that , by analogy to the example I referred to above , it is also important for children who are socially disadvantaged to be able to participate in an inclusive way alongside other children in all the various stages of education .
<en> To achieve this , two things have to be put in place .
<en> One is technological progress and removal of barriers .
<en> From this point of view , central and eastern European Member States are lagging far behind : schools , the school environment , transport facilities , even the hospitals , other institutions , public institutions , for example , are all inaccessible to wheelchair users .
<en> The other , and this will take longer , is the change in attitude that is needed on the part of decision-makers in order for them to acknowledge that inclusive education is the first crucial stage in the process that leads to social acceptance and integration .
<en> In conclusion , let me say that sports , too , are an important tool for education and social leverage , because social and societal differences disappear in sports ; the only things that matter are talent , determination and application .
<en> Physical education in schools and sports contribute greatly to strengthening important social values such as solidarity and respect for each other 's dignity .
<en> This is why I consider it important that when this House debates the quality , efficiency and equity of education and training , reference should also be made to the importance of physical education and its quality , efficiency and equity .
<en> We also need to ensure that inclusive education in this regard plays a major part .
<en> I congratulate the rapporteur and thank you for your attention .

<en> ( SK ) Italian authorities have informed the Member States of the European Union , through the European Early Warning and Response System , about an outbreak of tropical fever spread by the chikungunya virus in the Emilia-Romagna region .
<en> They have reported 197 cases of the tropical virus .
<en> Laboratory tests have confirmed that 14 % of the total number of ill people have contracted the virus and it has claimed one victim .
<en> Although there is no reason to panic yet , the European Commission must once more take steps to prepare for the possibility of a large epidemic .
<en> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , monitoring communicable diseases , notes that favourable climatic conditions allow the virus to spread , in particular in the Mediterranean region .

<en> ( EL ) Mr President , last week Arat Dink , son of Hrant Dink , the murdered Turkish journalist , was found guilty by a Turkish court because of a series of articles he had written on the Armenian genocide .
<en> Mr Dink , the editor of ' Agos ' newspaper , was found guilty according to Article 301 of Turkish Penal Code .
<en> This was the article which had been used to condemn his father .
<en> Hrant Dink has been given a one-year suspended prison sentence .
<en> It is therefore justifiable to ask ourselves what the European Commission is doing to urge Turkey to remove this article from its penal code .
<en> Further , ladies and gentlemen , in the face of Turkey 's continuing intransigence , how much more time do we believe Turkey needs before it finally understands that it has European commitments and should therefore behave like a democratic state ?
<sp>
<en> Mr President , there is disturbing news from Slovakia .
<en> The Director of the Danube Museum in Komárno , Csaba Fehér , has been threatened with dismissal .
<en> Among the charges is that he was co-organiser of an exhibition in the European Parliament last year .
<en> That exhibition documented the sufferings of the Hungarian minority under the Czechoslovak Government after 1945 on the basis of collective guilt .
<en> The concept of collective guilt is wholly irreconcilable with the civic norms and human rights that are at the heart of the European Union 's democratic underpinnings .
<en> Slovakia , as a Member State of the European Union , has accepted those principles in full .
<en> So , what the Slovak authorities are doing not only flies in the face of human rights normativity , but implicitly criticises the European Parliament .
<en> Slovakia must resolve these contradictions as rapidly as possible .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Statistics show that the European Union population is aging .
<en> Only 35 % of the European Union citizens are over 50 years old and only 16 % of the European Union population is under 14 years old .
<en> The European Union 's demographic policy is a policy that Europe 's future depends on .
<en> The demographic policy should refer to accessible health services and decent pensions for pensioners , measures to increase the birth-rate in all Member States , as well as to decent , stable and well paid jobs .
<en> For this reason , I ask the European Commission to develop , together with the Member States , a Community policy and national strategies as regards the demographic policy .
<en> The result of such measures will be seen in the next 20-30 years .
<en> Social Europe needs all its citizens and , especially , it needs each citizen to be integrated into society and have a decent living .
<en> This is why we have to correlate the population protection and development policies with the demographic policies .

<en> ( SK ) The Hungarian Guard was once again one of the main topics in Slovakia and Hungary this weekend .
<en> All people of good will strive for peace and conciliation between all nations .
<en> The present governments in Hungary and the Slovak Republic being what they are , there is the need for a strong Christian-Democratic opposition in the interest of democracy .
<en> However , we will not win if we succumb to sentiments and emotions .
<en> I am asking the Hungarian Government to respect the Treaty of Peace signed with Hungary in Paris on 10 February 1947 .
<en> In this Treaty Hungary pledged never to suffer in the future on its territory the existence and activities of fascist-like political , military and semi-military organisations , spinning revisionist propaganda .
<en> I can see nothing better that could be done in the name of peace and mutual understanding between our nations .

<en> Ladies and gentlemen , with the agreement of the political groups , and in accordance with our Rules of Procedure , I propose the following amendments to the agenda for the current part-session .
<en> Firstly , I propose that the vote on the motions for resolutions tabled to close the debate on the EU-Russia Summit be moved to the next part-session in Brussels .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I rise on a point of order under Rule 166 , and with reference to Rules 45 , 77 , 89 , 113 and 155 .
<en> We took a decision yesterday that we would have a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit this week , and my Group believes that we should stick to that .
<en> I know there is an attempt to try to revote that decision , but I hope the House will sensibly see off such a narrow-minded approach to politics .

<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , this now also concerns fellow Members .
<en> We were not informed about this application .
<en> There was a communication problem here yesterday .
<en> Neither the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats nor my group were informed of this request .
<en> This is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting .
<en> We have both - that is , my fellow Member , Mr Daul , and I - put forward the proposal this morning that we flesh out this resolution with care .
<en> We note the desire for a resolution and accept it on condition that we flesh it out with care .
<en> After the summit we shall also have all the information available , hence the deferral of the proposal until after the summit .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I do not know how strong communications are within the large groups .
<en> We have always said that we want a resolution - the General Secretaries have been informed of this .
<en> We have said that if you speak out against this , we shall do so at the vote on Monday morning , as is our right .
<en> We have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you , it is not our problem , but yours .
<en> As regards the content : a new law against extremists , for example , has been adopted in Russia in recent weeks that clearly restricts freedom of the press and freedom of opinion .
<en> We therefore want the resolution to be adopted before the summit to enable the EU to state our position on the situation in Russia through this resolution .
<en> We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit , but this Parliament , which wants to be political , should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament .

<en> Member of the Commission . - The Commission appreciates the interest shown by Parliament in a review of the trade defence instruments ( TDIs ) and reiterates the importance it attaches to the views of Parliament in the context of the current review .
<en> It looks forward to the report by the Committee on International Trade , which it hopes will be completed soon .
<en> On its side , the Commission is finalising its response to the consultation process .
<en> Indeed , the Commission held a preliminary discussion , an orientation debate , before its meeting today on this subject .
<en> Proposals to the Council could be made in the next weeks .
<en> The Commission intends to keep Parliament closely involved and informed on this .
<en> The Commission has , of course , carefully examined all reactions to the Green Paper , of which there are many hundreds .
<en> The intention now is to inform Member States and Parliament of the main reactions and suggestions received , and these will also be published .
<en> They will be discussed by the Commission again before proposals are tabled to the Council , hopefully in the last half of November .
<en> Most stakeholders consulted and submitting their views share the Commission 's opinion that TDIs remain essential in a globalising world economy where multilaterally-agreed competition rules are lacking .
<en> Also , the majority of stakeholders do not see the need for a major overhaul of the TDI system .
<en> Neither does the Commission .
<en> However , there is also a wish for the rules to be made clearer , as well as for increased transparency and for there to be more efficient application of the instruments .
<en> The claim that the Commission has changed its approach towards the assessment of Community interest in some recent cases is simply not true .
<en> Each case has been examined on the basis of its own technical merits .
<en> Some cases have raised atypical issues , but they have been resolved in line with Community legislation and within the small discretion allowed by that legislation , after thorough discussion with Member States .
<en> Lastly , it is correct that no new anti-dumping investigations were initiated in the first half of 2007 .
<en> However , it should be pointed out that anti-dumping investigations are industry-driven and are not initiated by us .
<en> In other words , they are initiated on the basis of complaints from Community industry .
<en> In the first six months of 2007 , no complaints meeting the requirements of the law were lodged .
<en> It is not unusual that the number of initiations varies from one year to another , depending on factors such as the business cycle , over-capacity in third countries and diversion of trade as a result of trade defence measures in other world markets .
<en> The number of initiations has also fluctuated in past years .
<en> In 2003 , for example , the Commission initiated in total only eight new investigations , the first of which was initiated at the end of May in that year .
<en> Also , the first semester of 2007 followed a period of exceptionally high activity at the end of 2006 .
<en> Finally , I would draw your attention to the fact that in September 2007 two new anti-dumping investigations were initiated against imports from China : one for citric acid and another for monosodium glutamate .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Commissioner , thank you very much for your comments .
<en> Transparency plays an important role in this process .
<en> When are we going to receive the evaluation of the Green Paper survey ?
<en> Either there is no evaluation yet , in which case you would have released your paper without an evaluation , or there is an evaluation - I assume that there is - in which case it is high time that it was presented to the public and to Parliament .
<en> Secondly , I am interested to know whether you believe it is really tenable to determine essential matters without amending the basic regulation on the basis of new principles .
<en> Thirdly , why is it that you want to treat ' market ' and ' non-market ' economies equally ?
<en> Fourthly , still talking about Community production , where do you see the percentage threshold for production outside the EU ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - The Commission has undertaken a preliminary assessment of the responses to the Green Paper , and that provided the basis for our orientation discussion on the subject today .
<en> That paves the way for an even more rigorous assessment , which will accompany the Commission 's consideration and agreement on the proposals that it wishes to submit to Member States on the basis of the review .
<en> I can assure the honourable Member that information about the responses is - already , I believe - posted on the website of DG TRADE , but we shall also publish what is , I hope , an easily accessible version or presentation of the responses we have had to the Green Paper in order to allow good time for reflection on those responses to take place ahead of the submission by the Commission of our proposals .
<en> The honourable Member seems to have alighted already on certain aspects of the Commission 's proposals which have not yet been submitted to or agreed to by the Commission , so I suggest , with respect , that he is slightly jumping ahead of himself in some of the assumptions that he appears to be making .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) The question I would like to ask is , obviously , based on my meetings and discussions with the industrialists of the country I represent - Lithuania .
<en> In fact , I can reiterate what my colleague has said : there is a lot of concern about the liberalisation of the trade policy , and also a lot of criticism .
<en> My question is : if the position remains the same , what will be the Commission 's reaction ?
<en> What measures can the Commission be expected to take ?
<en> Would you be inclined to listen to what business representatives have to say , or would you consider other arguments to be more important ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - I am not quite sure what the honourable Member means by the ' liberalisation of our trade policy ' .
<en> By definition , trade can only take place when markets are opened and trade flows are , in effect , being liberalised .
<en> Trade does not take place behind closed borders or where economies are being converted into fortresses , so of course the Commission seeks to promote the liberalisation of trade .
<en> The Global Europe trade policy review and strategy that was presented and agreed by the Commission and the Member States a year ago sets out very clearly the interests of the European Union , which are to maintain open markets at home , to promote and use multilateral and bilateral negotiations , to open markets abroad and to use effective trade defence measures to tackle unfair trade or unfair competition .
<en> Those are the three legs of our strategy ; each is equally important .
<en> The review of the third leg of that tripod is taking place after quite dramatic changes have taken place in the world economy , and indeed in the European economy , since the last review of our trade defence measures took place , which was over 10 years ago .
<en> We have a responsibility to make sure that our measures are operating as well as they could be and that they command consensus and support and solidarity amongst our Member States .
<en> When that weakens , the trade defence measures become less easy or possible to use .
<en> It is in an effort to rebuild and restore that consensus , support and solidarity amongst our Member States that we are undertaking this review .

<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) Smoking is a major public health problem that claims several hundred thousand victims every year , including non-smokers .
<en> As this is a problem on a global scale , it calls for multifaceted action , commitment on the part of Member States , and effective legislation that is even tougher than hitherto .
<en> Protection of European citizens ' health demands this .
<en> Clearly , the road to achieving the primary objective , a smoke-free Europe , will be a long one , requiring tremendous effort and commitment .
<en> For this reason , we have to take things one step at a time .
<en> Several Member States have set an example that we should follow , taking sound and effective action to avert the dangers of passive smoking .
<en> One of the next steps should be to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces , including the catering sector , all public buildings and all public transport within two years throughout the whole of the European Union .
<en> To combat smoking successfully , we need a sound basis , a comprehensive Community strategy based on relevant studies and the best empirical knowledge , aimed at controlling smoking and encouraging people to quit .
<en> Planning effective legislative measures , prevention and education all have a key role to play in such a strategy .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( ET ) Ladies and gentlemen , every year cigarette smoking leads over 650 000 Europeans to a premature death .
<en> None of them decides to take up smoking in the desire to kill themselves .
<en> Smokers are addicts , slaves of persistent , decades-long propaganda .
<en> Only tough PR can explain the fact that whilst 86 % of Europeans believe that the workplace should be smoke-free , only 61 % think that the same should be true for bars and restaurants .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , waiters and bar staff also have a right to life and to health protection !
<en> Each year 80 000 people die from passive smoking .
<en> Regardless of their own wishes they have breathed in a mixture of 250 carcinogens and toxins .
<en> Waiters in establishments where smoking is allowed are 50 % more likely to contract lung cancer than staff working in smoke-free establishments .
<en> None of this is news .
<en> Yet 30 % of European Union citizens are smokers .
<en> The free market economy has not stopped an unhealthy habit which causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and costs taxpayers billions .
<en> It is clear that lawmakers must act .
<en> I agree with the report that only a 100 % smoke-free environment is an environment which can meet today 's health requirements .
<en> In addition to a ban , however , we also need measures which help smokers free themselves from their addiction .
<en> We need only look at the sums spent by the tobacco industry on advertising to understand the enormity of the challenge we face .
<en> Half-measures are no longer adequate .
<en> It is time to act in earnest .

<en> The next item is the recommendation by Gianluca Susta , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement ( 08934 / 2006 - C6-0359 / 2006 -
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretariat of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament for the support it has given me .
<en> I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs , as well as Mr Van Hecke , who preceded me in covering this dossier , for the excellent work carried out and for managing to maintain the unity of our institution right through to the end .
<en> In my opinion , this has been Parliament 's greatest strength in the campaign to promote access to medicines in the developing and less-developed countries where they are most needed .
<en> The right to health and access to health at affordable prices are fundamental rights and should be guaranteed for all citizens .
<en> Unfortunately we know only too well that this is not always the case : all too often the prices imposed by the pharmaceutical industry are too high , with the result that countries where they are most needed find themselves in difficulty .
<en> For this reason , as I have already said on several occasions , both in the Committee on International Trade and in plenary , Parliament could not blindly accept the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement as if it were a universal panacea , and then consider the matter resolved .
<en> Parliament wanted more to be done , at least within the European Union , because the European Union can and must do more .
<en> Even in the light of the regrettable events of this summer , such as the exchange of letters with Thailand , even if partially resolved , the European Parliament , which has always been a great advocate of using all the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreement , could not give the go-ahead for the ratification of the protocol without obtaining real and effective guarantees from the Commission and the Council .
<en> I think it is fair to stress that during these months of close collaboration with the Commission and the Council , we have undoubtedly achieved an important goal for the European Union , by putting an essentially technical dossier at the top of the European political agenda .
<en> I believe that the end result can be qualified as a success , not only for this reason , but above all because we have succeeded in making progress in extremely sensitive areas , such as encouraging the use of the flexibilities provided for under the TRIPS Agreement so that we can promote access to essential medicines at affordable prices within the framework of national public health programmes .
<en> I particularly support the explicit reference contained in the Council Statement - presented on Monday - to Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement .
<en> For my group , this represents a guarantee and an assurance that Member States will be able to use this instrument without coming under pressure and that there will be easier access to medicines in countries where they are most needed .
<en> Secondly : I am also delighted at the results obtained in terms of TRIPS-plus , namely the more stringent provisions as regards those provided for under the TRIPS Agreement .
<en> Parliament , the Council and the Commission have agreed that there should be no negotiations in future bilateral or regional agreements with developing countries on provisions that might have negative consequences for health and access to medicines .
<en> Despite this , while recognising the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency , I would like to ask whether the text of the statement can be further improved , particularly in the section referring to poor developing countries .
<en> This expression could create confusion , since it is now customary to refer only to developing countries and to the category of less-developed countries .
<en> To insert a new category would complicate the situation .
<en> Above all , it is important to stress that all developing countries , hence even countries such as Brazil , India , etc . , must be able to use the current system without running the risk of pejorative provisions being introduced in future .
<en> Last but not least , it is vital to underline the efforts made to date in terms of the transfer of research and technological development to southern countries .
<en> The ALDE Group is ready to give its assent because it believes that a ' no ' would send out a negative signal to the countries most in need , and would be irresponsible on the part of the European Union given that the reopening of the WTO negotiations is unrealistic .
<en> However , this does not change the fact that we continue to have reservations about the efficiency of the mechanism studied and approved by the WTO .
<en> For this reason , and I am almost at the end now , I would like to confirm that the EU will not stop here .
<en> Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the guarantees that have been given over the past few months will be honoured in practice .
<en> Therefore we ask Commissioner Mandelson , who in his letter confirmed that he did not intend to negotiate TRIPS-plus provisions , to remove from the draft Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean countries the request for adherence to and acceptance of the obligations of the Patent Cooperation Treaty , the Patent Law Treaty and the intellectual property provisions of Directive 2004 / 48 / EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights , which unequivocally resemble TRIPS-plus provisions .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am very pleased that we have been able to find a solution agreeable to all on the important issue of access to medicines for poor , developing countries .
<en> Our debate during the last months has been fruitful and I would like to thank Parliament for the intensity and the quality of our exchanges .
<en> The Commission has always been receptive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and , indeed , shares most of them .
<en> That is why the Commission was at the forefront of the debate on TRIPS and access to medicines in the WTO .
<en> I have seen in this debate an opportunity for the Commission to clarify its position on a number of issues .
<en> We all agree that the amendment of the TRIPS agreement is one part of the solution among many others to the problem of access to medicines .
<en> Obviously , other measures are needed , in particular to improve health care systems and the infrastructures , notably in poor , developing countries .
<en> Some Members fear that the mechanism will not work .
<en> This is certainly too early to assert .
<en> In our regulation implementing the waiver , and together with Parliament , we agreed to evaluate it three years after its entry into force , and we will do it .
<en> We also support the work of the intergovernmental working group with the WHO to explore other measures to further improve access to medicines .
<en> The Commission has been able to reaffirm its attachment to the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement on public health and its support for the flexibilities contained therein .
<en> Similarly , this debate allows me to dispel any misunderstanding about what the Commission is doing in the economic partnership agreements with ACP countries .
<en> Let me confirm that , in those agreements and in other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries , the Commission is not asking and will not ask for provisions which could affect access to medicines or undermine the TRIPS flexibilities contained in the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health .
<en> Thanks to this frank and direct debate Parliament is now in a position to give its assent to the Commission proposal .
<en> The European Community will then join the other WTO members which have already accepted the TRIPS agreement .
<en> This acceptance will enable the EC to continue to play a leading role in the WTO on the issue of access to medicines .
<en> To conclude , I would like to insist that access to medicines remains a priority for the Commission and I am willing to continue to work in a constructive spirit with Parliament on this matter in the future .
<sp>
<en> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sorry that the Council is not represented in our debate this evening because for once it is our main contact .
<en> The atmosphere here is euphoric , everyone is in agreement and tomorrow we are going to vote - by a crushing majority , I think - for the ratification of this amendment to the TRIPS agreement , which is supposed to provide and should provide better access to medicines for countries that are not sufficiently developed and do not have a pharmaceutical industry that allows them this access .
<en> What happened during the long debate we have had on this , is that Parliament was a little more doubtful than the Commission about the efficacy of this system .
<en> I believe - and I would like to thank the Council here for having listened to Parliament more than the Commission , for once - that this is what led to the statement distributed on Monday morning , thanks to which we have accepted that an agreement between us enables us to make this small step forward .
<en> It is an improvement , but it is an improvement the inadequacy of which we are aware of and regarding the effectiveness of which we have a few doubts .
<en> These few doubts need to be removed by the stringency with which the Member States and the Council apply the recommendations .
<en> I am delighted , however , by what has just been said by Mr Mandelson , who has himself announced a group of experts to find other measures , and an evaluation of these measures , and I think we will be discussing these matters again once we have seen whether the effectiveness meets our expectations .
<en> In any case , I am pleased about the positive conclusion to this necessary stage , even if it does not go far enough .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , as rapporteur of the European People 's Party I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Sousa , and my other fellow Members for the productive cooperation we have enjoyed , for it enabled us to overcome certain differences between political groups and to maintain a united position on this important issue .
<en> The European Parliament has not been limited to areas of responsibility as laid down by the Treaty ; it has not been restricted merely to giving its assent .
<en> In the July resolution a political victory was achieved expressing a united will transcending party politics .
<en> Making commitments by the Commission and the Council was sought and achieved .
<en> They coincide to a great extent with the views of the European Parliament .
<en> It could be said to have been a rehearsal for institutional cooperation in light of the new role the European Parliament will play once the Reform Treaty has been adopted .
<en> The acceptance by the Union of the amendment is thus backed up by real commitments , which ensure the process works successfully .
<en> The commitments also go much further : they lay down guidelines for an integrated approach to the issue of the public health of developing countries .
<en> The acceptance by the Union of the amendment to the TRIPS Agreement sends a positive and hopeful message to developing countries .
<en> We hope that it will also involve the active cooperation of other members of the WTO .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , the problem of effective enforcement of monetary claims across the territory of the European Union is very important in terms of ensuring proper functioning of the internal market .
<en> It is worth considering Community action in this regard .
<en> There is a very important saying that was impressed on me when I was a trainee lawyer , according to which when we do someone a favour we become indebted to them .
<en> This is sometimes true .
<en> Delaying payments or failing to make them altogether endangers the interests of companies and consumers alike .
<en> The differences in the efficiency of debt recovery that currently exist within the European Union can threaten the competitiveness of companies whose activities extend beyond the borders of a particular Member State .
<en> The systems for enforcing orders differ between individual Member States .
<en> In some states they are more effective than in others .
<en> As things stand at present , a debtor may almost instantly transfer funds from accounts known to the creditor to other accounts located in the same country or in another Member State .
<en> This makes it practically impossible for creditors to block those funds .
<en> Furthermore , creditors seeking enforcement of an order in another Member State are confronted with a different legal system and procedural requirements .
<en> The language barrier and cost of the proceedings represent additional obstacles .
<en> I therefore believe that we should respond positively to the proposal to create a European system to attach bank accounts .
<en> Bearing in mind the increasing integration in the Single Euro Payments Area , legal regulation of this type is both appropriate and essential .
<en> I would like to thank Mr Lechner for this report .
<en> I am sure it will represent a turning point in the Union 's legal system .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , just a brief remark about the comments made by Mr Medina Ortega and also to thank everyone who has spoken .
<en> This European instrument , this European attachment order that is under discussion , really could complement national legislation and hence deal with the serious infringements of creditors ' rights that occur on a transnational basis .
<en> I very much agree with Mr Medina Ortega about the fact that we must give thought to attachment , or protection , as it were , in respect of people who take refuge in tax havens .
<en> Clearly , as you are all aware , Europe has no unilateral power to act .
<en> What we must work towards , in my opinion , is closer cooperation between the judiciary , the financial investigation authorities and the major banking groups which operate in these so-called tax havens .
<en> We need to convince those countries ' governments that it is ultimately in their interest to cooperate with the European Union .
<en> Therefore , even if we do not have an active instrument in the near future , a unilateral tool to counter the system of tax havens , we ought to be able to use the instrument of democracy , on the one hand , and that of judicial and financial cooperation , on the other , to tackle what is a very real problem .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .

<sp>
<en> The next item is the explanations of vote .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - We are opposing a continued expansion of the EU budget , which today is already too extensive , with a large part of the funds going to the wrong ends .
<en> Today there seem to be a reciprocal action between new objectives for the Union and demands on financing by the EU .
<en> This means new demands on payments from the Member States , but also that new funds are being transferred to a system which is bureaucratic , inefficient and complex .
<en> Today there is also too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects , and not enough on the environment and social projects .
<en> However , there are many desirable initiatives being financed via the budget , and we support reasonable changes to existing means .
<en> We did choose to support the specific amendment 945 , since it covers , among other things , aid to Palestine , even though there were other aspects of the amendment of which we do not approve .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I completely oppose European funds being used to grow tobacco in the European Union .
<en> Half a million EU citizens die needlessly each year due to tobacco addiction .
<en> We cannot continue to subsidise tobacco growing in the EU .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I have chosen to vote to the fullest possible extent in favour of the Council 's draft budget for 2008 , and therefore against all increases in expenditure proposed by the European Parliament .
<en> It is extremely unfortunate that Parliament wishes to finance Galileo through the Community budget .
<en> If it transpires that the private operators back out owing to profitability problems , the EU should take the consequences and discontinue the project or allow interested Member States to join in , as happened with Boeing .
<en> I have also been involved in the issue of the abolition of subsidies for tobacco producers and support for wine production , and can only regret that Parliament is not prepared to support those proposals .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
<en> Of course no budget is perfect , but we must nevertheless strive to spend common funds in a just and future-oriented manner .
<en> Unfortunately , most of the European Union budget continues to be spent on preserving the conditions of the past .
<en> This is why it is important to ensure that some money goes towards the future , towards research , development and science .
<en> The financing of the European Institute of Technology still needs to be resolved , because the Commission has proposed a bridging solution of a maximum amount of EUR 308 million .
<en> Budapest would be an ideal location for the European Institute of Technology , owing to its excellent research results and the scientific expertise it has gathered in combating climate change .
<en> This is another reason why I am keen to see a resolution to the issue of financing .
<en> We Hungarians are able to provide an appropriate location for an Institute that is modest in size , economical , but all the more rigorous in terms of its intellectual basis .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , congratulations to Mr Schmitt on his own-initiative report .
<en> I hold the opposing view to Mr Lundgren .
<en> Unfortunately , in school matters , the European Union is being restrained by the Member States , for any objective analysis of the problem quickly reveals how vital it is that the approach to different aspects of schooling be harmonised .
<en> PE is part of this , in the same way as training in creative thinking or social involvement .
<en> Mr Schmitt 's report concentrates on PE .
<en> While in the USA only very sporty students who also have excellent grades get a place at a good university , in Europe it is exactly the other way around .
<en> The higher the level of schooling , the less time there is for young people to be involved in sport .
<en> PE has a lowly status in the world of school .
<en> Sport is regarded as being only a leisure activity , and that is a mistake .
<en> Sport enables people to overcome mental limits , and that is exactly what we need in Europe .
<en> These days , people often manage to have a career in sport despite school , and not because of school .
<en> That is an error in our system , one that the present report brings to our notice .
<en> Finally , I should like to speak up for a community that cannot do so here for itself .
<en> Due to the political situation in their country , young sportspeople in the Turkish part of Cyprus cannot take part in international competitions .
<en> They hope that the European Union will bring an end to their isolation .
<en> By now , more than three years since Cyprus joined the European Union , if a solution is not already in place , at least a proposal for one should be under consideration .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Madam President , we take care of the balanced development of our economy , but often we neglect the need for balanced development of our children - not only their intellectual development , but also their physical development .
<en> The school years are a period of dynamic growth in children and young people and of rapid biological development and maturation .
<en> Physical movement and the exercise of various muscle groups is particularly important for health during this period .
<en> Young people spend a lot of time in front of television screens or computer monitors .
<en> This may help intellectual development , but it has a negative impact on physical development .
<en> It causes curvature of the spine .
<en> This may be avoided through regular involvement in sport .
<en> Meanwhile , school sports facilities are often not accessible after lessons , and young people are unable to make use of them .
<en> I support the report .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission 's White Paper and Mr Schmitt 's excellent report feature both the educative function of PE in schools and the role of sport in social integration and fostering good health .
<en> Awareness of all aspects of this in society should now be increased .
<en> Alongside what we have learned from the European Year of Education through Sport and from the Lifelong Learning , Youth and Europe for Citizens programmes , it is now time to devise initiatives to make the most , in our times , of the various forms of physical activity comprising sport , both in schools , clubs and associations , and as spontaneous , informal physical activity .
<en> In an era when we do very little physical activity , sport has much greater significance for us than it did for our parents and grandparents .
<en> In a time when children prefer to play computer games , there is a growing need to promote active , healthy lifestyles for children and young people .
<en> Unfortunately , there are many signs that , in many schools , even the time available for PE often fails to correspond to the reality on the ground - that is , implementation sometimes fails to meet with legal obligations .
<en> It seems that a reality check is necessary in many schools in this regard .
<en> I also support the rapporteur when he calls on the Commission to draw up guidelines on the application of the State aid rules to public sports facilities - naturally , fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity - together with the national and European umbrella organisations for sports .
<en> We need clarity on what type of state support is regarded as acceptable and lawful and which aspects can be integrated with one another , possibly including the strengthening of investment in physical education , and with regard to the financing , if necessary with assistance from European funds within the framework of the Structural Funds , of the modernisation and provision of schools .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Madam President , I fully support the draft resolution , and I thank the rapporteur for the very good drafting of this text .
<en> For me there is no doubt : in my youth - and the same will be true of most of you - school and youth sport affected a much larger percentage of young people .
<en> Now the number of hours of PE at school has fallen .
<en> Of course this has an impact on young people 's health , as Mrs Tomaszewska has said .
<en> Involvement in sport must be given due prestige .
<en> One way of doing this may be to include sport in the scope of application of the European transfer of credit points in schooling and vocational training .
<en> Mutual recognition of diplomas and licences conferring a right to provide services in the sports sector throughout the European Union will certainly help to guarantee the free flow of students , sports people and employees in Europe and will improve the opportunities for people in this industry to find good jobs .
<en> Emphasis should also be placed on the social and cultural aspect of the existence of clubs and sports associations for local people and national communities .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Madam President , Mr. Commissioner , dear colleagues , I welcome and support Mr. Pál Schmitt 's report on the role of sport in education because it offers us , one more time , the possibility to get actively involved in improving the life of our fellow citizens .
<en> Supporting physical education and sport , the European Parliament gives a signal not only for a healthier life , but also for the promotion of the common European values that we all inherited from Greece and Ancient Rome .
<en> We have to give more substance to the dictum mens sana in corpore sano via concrete actions which are often conditioned by financial aspects .
<en> For this reason , we ask the Commission , the Council and the Member States to find the adequate instruments to increase investments in the field of school infrastructure and equipment .
<en> One extremely efficient way to achieve this consists in the European funds for disadvantaged regions , especially in the new Member States , which need to be supported in order to increase their capacity of absorption .
<en> Moreover , I believe that the European Union should initiate a sustained media campaign , especially in the TV children and youth programmes , in order to encourage them to practice sport so as to reduce obesity , smoking and drug consumption , as well as to promote correctness , team spirit , discipline , solidarity , tolerance and to combat discrimination .
<en> As regards us , many Members of the European Parliament have practiced sport .
<en> I believe we should establish a way to annually reward the best initiatives for promoting physical education and sport , by offering a prize , for instance .

<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland .
<en> This debate is a further demonstration that the proposed soil policy is very controversial .
<en> Now that there are two proposals - the strategy and the Directive - it seems as though a new branch of environmental policy is being introduced .
<en> I say ' seems ' , as nothing could be further from the truth .
<en> Sustainable management of soil use already comes to the fore in 33 European directives , such as the Water Framework Directive .
<en> Why , then , are we presenting overlapping legislation , entailing yet more burdens , particularly for Member States that already have a well-functioning soil policy ?
<en> I shall be supporting Mr Prodi 's Thematic Strategy .
<en> In my opinion , Member States who have yet to develop a soil policy must do so on the basis of the strategy .
<en> The framework directive , on the other hand , is disproportionate and also , in my view , contravenes the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> Unlike air and water , soil does not have a cross-border dimension , and policy is often implemented on a regional or local scale .
<en> This is also the reason that I - that is , Mr Blokland - have joined in signing the amendment rejecting the Commission proposal .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , we are familiar with the idea that a land grab is the unwarranted appropriation of property belonging to another .
<en> It seems to me that this soil directive amounts to an unwarranted power grab by Brussels , and of course brings with it an inevitable layer of fresh bureaucracy .
<en> Soil , as has been said in this debate , unlike air and water , does not flow from state to state .
<en> It has no cross-border dimension .
<en> Thus policy on soil is and should remain a Member State issue .
<en> IPPC , cross-compliance obligations , the Landfill Directive and the Nitrates Directive all give us more than enough EU involvement .
<en> Hence I have no apology for favouring total rejection of this power-hungry proposal .
<en> But , if , true to form , the EU nonetheless decides to meddle in this national issue , then one initiative it could consider is to introduce a payment to farmers in return for providing carbon sequestration in soil management and farming practices .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , my first thought on this proposal for a directive was to reject the text .
<en> I also think that a framework directive was perhaps not an appropriate solution .
<en> Why have another text on the protection of soil when we already have a whole raft of regulations on soil , waste , pesticides and the protection of nature ?
<en> Within the framework of better lawmaking , I was thinking that we should not appear to be going through the European Commission mill again .
<en> I was putting myself in the shoes particularly of the mayors of our municipalities , who would find themselves with another text to dissect .
<en> However , the reality is this : human practices have not respected the soil .
<en> We have worn out the soil with intensive production .
<en> In addition to this there is climate change and desertification .
<en> Our urban planning policies have mineralised the soil , degraded it , and our fellow citizens are now surprised when they experience catastrophic flooding because the soil no longer absorbs the rain .
<en> Who has not seen the open wounds in the landscape caused by the quarries that supply us with such valuable materials ?
<en> Impoverished , dried out , degraded , polluted and bruised soil - that is what has become of this land , which previous generations spoke about with veneration because the land was everything to them : their work , their food , their life and , for many , their only property .
<en> What was once our mother Earth we now regard with suspicion .
<en> What will be the consequences of this degradation , this pollution , for our environment and health ?
<en> Mrs Gutiérrez has done a remarkable job in trying to find an acceptable approach , in trying to bring closer together those who did not want this directive and those who did .
<en> She has listened to Parliament .
<en> She has found balanced positions that respect the need for subsidiarity in the choice of methods , because there is enormous disparity between the Member States .
<en> The final text has evolved a great deal .
<en> It avoids increasing the burden of administrative costs by encouraging us to put right the mistakes of the past , our agricultural , industrial and urban practices that did not respect the soil .
<en> This report , completely remodelled by Mrs Gutiérrez , is satisfactory .
<en> There is such soil diversity in the European Union that the subsidiarity guarantee is essential , while ensuring the protection and sustainable use of the soil .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) It is our fundamental goal to guarantee a healthy environment for our citizens , and there is stringent Union legislation for most elements of our environment .
<en> Soil is the only element of the environment that we have not yet been able to regulate , so there is currently no Union instrument to halt the pollution of soil and the erosion of its quality , even though this causes many tens of millions of euros ' worth of damage for all of us .
<en> According to the current legislation , it is only compulsory to act against soil pollution when the pollution enters other elements of the environment : groundwater , fresh water , agricultural products , or when it is too late to act in practice .
<en> I would welcome the adoption of this new Directive by the European Union , and I am pleased that a compromise package has been created that is even more acceptable from the perspective of environmental protection .
<en> It is also important from a Hungarian perspective that , as many of us have proposed , the legislation should also deal with tackling soil acidification .
<en> This is a serious threat to agricultural production , so it must be fought using Union instruments for this reason too .
<en> Recognition of the polluted areas will encourage remediation , so we can prevent the pollution of water tables for drinking water , and naturally the cultivation of polluted plants .
<en> Soil regulation is therefore in the interests of farmers .
<en> I therefore hope that certain MEPs from the right , including , surprisingly , some Hungarian MEPs , will not succeed in their endeavour to prevent the creation of a Directive to protect the interests of Hungarian agriculture and the environment .
<en> In the spirit of the Directive , the rehabilitation of the polluted or soil-degraded areas uncovered will be a task for the Union , for which resources will need to be found in future Community budgets .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , this proposal for a directive on soil protection has huge credibility gaps .
<en> Firstly , soil contents and qualities in different parts of an individual country vary considerably .
<en> How much more variance will there be between the soils of 27 different countries with vastly differing climates ?
<en> It is absurd to suggest that the EU can introduce a one-size-fits-all directive on soil from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia .
<en> Now a word on behalf of our already hard-pressed farmers , many of whom have written to my constituency office to strongly question the need for a directive on soil protection .
<en> They have quite rightly pointed out that they have a vested interest in protecting the soil , because it is their livelihood .
<en> They also suggest that it would place another onerous burden upon them because of the failure to give enough recognition to existing national legislation .
<en> The second large credibility gap is provided by the EU 's short-sighted open border policy , which has encouraged mass immigration from Eastern Europe to my country .
<en> This has generated the need for a correspondingly huge programme of house building on every square inch of land available - some three million new homes by 2020 , we are told .
<en> Even the green belt is under threat .
<en> Burying vast acreages under solid concrete is not my idea of the best way to protect soil .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this first reading report on Commission plans to protect soil .
<en> I am in favour of the need to protect soil , but am yet to be convinced that a directive is the right approach , or whether a less prescriptive approach would be more suitable .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this report but voted against paragraphs 8 and 10 as I do not accept that there is a need for additional legislation relating to soil protection .
<en> There is a range of legal instruments in place already to ensure the maximum protection possible for soil , and until these pieces of legislation are fully implemented and the effects are fully analysed , I do not believe that further legislation in this area is either necessary or desirable .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Protection of the environment is a politically important issue in Europe which has developed rapidly in recent years and in which research continues to be a priority for the Union .
<en> However , the environment cannot be protected in Europe without protecting the soil which is exposed to various degradation processes .
<en> The need for specific protection measures within a new European framework in this area therefore makes total sense .
<en> We recognise that , in the main , soil is in private ownership , but also that soil is a natural resource of public interest and therefore must be preserved for the benefit of future generations .
<en> As protection of the soil is closely linked with the main international environmental challenges , there is a need to consider Community legislation which is specifically designed to protect the soil itself and which can encourage the exchange of information and coordination of good practices among the Member States .
<en> Inserting soil protection in a future climate regime therefore seems to presuppose the recognition of the need for greater knowledge about the role of this resource in the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my support for the Prodi report .
<en> Europe does need a common soil strategy .
<en> Soil degradation is continuing across Europe , given that existing legislation is inadequate to combat phenomena such as erosion , the loss of organic material , compaction , salinisation , landslides and contamination .
<en> A plan of action and measures need to be devised at European level , obviously with due account for national circumstances and within a framework of subsidiarity and cooperation with the Member States .
<en> This is crucial above all in terms of identifying areas at risk and drawing up packages of measures .
<en> Moreover , it is vitally important that all 27 Member States should have a minimum level of legislation in this area and that education and awareness-raising campaigns be introduced .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Multi-faceted protection of the soil is one of the main challenges for environmental protection at international level .
<en> It also has a tremendous impact on the economies of the Member States .
<en> I wish to express my concern about the consequences of natural degradation of the soil and degradation caused by human activity .
<en> Degradation of the soil is often the result of inappropriate human activity in the areas of agriculture and forestry .
<en> It can also be a consequence of industry , tourism , and urban development .
<en> I should like to point out to the House that compliance with the provisions of the directive will make it possible for degraded land to be reclassified , thus preventing the use of green field sites for industrial and commercial purposes .
<en> The directive will also provide for soil to be classified in terms of its potential for plant and animal production , with particular reference to the production of high quality food .
<en> I should like to highlight the need to develop a European strategy aimed at identifying and resolving issues relating to soil degradation .
<en> Due to the great variety of soil types , a European strategy is required , independently of national action .
<en> Such a European strategy would be based on prevention , and would aim to raise public awareness and to persuade the public of the need for soil protection .
<en> In addition , the strategy would identify risk areas with a view to resolving this problem at European level .
<en> It should be noted that it is important to establish a clear demarcation between this directive and other European legislative standards relating to soil protection in order to avoid regulatory duplication .
<en> Current European legislation does not appear to prevent degradation of the soil .
<en> At the same time , soil protection is closely linked to the main international challenges in the area of protection of the natural environment .
<en> I therefore believe that there is a clear need to develop Community legislation aimed at protecting the soil as such .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PT ) Madam President , you probably did not hear what I said .
<en> I started by saying that , in a spirit of compromise , we would be prepared to accept this suggestion .
<en> However , in that spirit of Christmas compromise , we should like our Socialist friends in turn to accept our proposal for a resolution on the issue of Venezuela following the referendum there .
<sp>
<en> Does any Member wish to speak against this proposal ?
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , I am rather surprised at this proposal from the Socialist Group .
<en> The joint motion for a resolution by the Socialists , the Greens and my Group incorporated the resolution adopted in Kigali .
<en> In Kigali , the members of the PPE-DE Group also agreed to this compromise , so I simply cannot understand why everything should now be postponed for further debate when , together , Members of this House had already reached an agreement .
<en> The fact is that everyone agreed to this compromise in Kigali !
<en> I am therefore opposed to this postponement because the document in question has been endorsed by a large number of Members already and could be voted on today .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , just so that there are no misunderstandings : the problem is not the substance ; the problem is that they want to ensure that they get a majority .
<en> I think that is legitimate .
<en> You are absolutely right , Mr Markov ; the proposal implies that the debate should start again , which is hard to understand , but the Socialists ' idea - let 's see - is about securing a majority to endorse what everyone wants to achieve anyway .
<en> That is the issue and that is the reason why they want a postponement .
<en> That is all .
<en> ( Parliament approved the request )
<sp>
<en> The vote on the motions on economic partnership agreements is postponed until December and the deadlines proposed are as follows :
<en> for tabling motions for a resolution , Wednesday , 5 December at 12 noon ;
<en> for amendments and joint motions for a resolution , Monday , 10 December at 7 p.m.
<en> The vote will take place on Wednesday , 12 December .
<en> I have received a request from the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats for the debate on the statement by the Commission concerning the referendum in Venezuela to be concluded , with the submission of motions for a resolution .
<en> Does any Member wish to speak against this request ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur Mrs Kallenbach , to the other shadow rapporteurs , and to Mrs McCarthy , Chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , for seeing through this complicated legal package .
<en> When almost two years ago we started this work , we were assured that this would above all be a technical measure , the sole purpose of which was to use the UN Firearms Protocol to enable it to become EU legislation .
<en> The process , however , was anything but a technical one .
<en> Some wanted to ban weapons completely and restrict people 's legal enjoyment of them , whilst certain people did not want to see any kinds of controls on the purchase and use of weapons .
<en> Under the leadership of our rapporteur , Mrs Kallenbach , however , we found a balanced compromise among the main groups , one which takes account of the safety of individuals and society as well as the needs of those who enjoy using weapons as a pastime and hunters too , for example .
<en> It is a good thing that all weapons in the EU should be registered in order to make it easier to trace them and that Member States in future will have to keep the details of a weapon and its owner for a period of 20 years .
<en> It is also important that imitation and converted weapons should be covered under the directive .
<en> The lives of hunters and marksmen will be made a lot easier when the European Firearms Pass is the only document they need when travelling from one country to another , and there should be no fee charged for one .
<en> The age limit of 18 years old which is stipulated in the directive and its exceptions is sensible , in my view .
<en> It means , for example , that in my country , Finland , the thousands of registered underage hunters may continue to pursue their hobby with the permission of their parents , just as they have up until now .
<en> It is directives such as these which prove their worth in the eyes of the public .
<en> The EU 's Four Freedoms will likewise gain strength when the EU is developed as a safe area of internal rights .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , I too first of all would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Kallenbach , for a very well drafted report .
<en> It is important for everyone 's future to prevent the illegal manufacture of , and the trade in , firearms .
<en> The report will help achieve this objective .
<en> We Finns have been concerned about whether or not young people should be allowed to continue to hunt for pleasure .
<en> The sport is subject to licence in Finland and closely supervised , and there is guidance available from experienced hunters in the safe and responsible use of weapons .
<en> I think it is important that this best practice and long tradition in Finland will also be able to continue after the new directive has been adopted .
<en> It is important that tomorrow we agree a carefully prepared compromise , in which the different practices in the Member States are made compatible and the Member States can allow , subject to certain conditions , the purchase and possession of firearms for the purposes of hunting for under 18-year-olds too .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , it is very important to control possession of firearms if we wish to ensure the safety of people living in Europe .
<en> Clearly , any relevant provisions must not unduly restrict the right of citizens to ensure their own security on their own property , nor must they restrict their right to ensure their personal safety when undertaking important public duties or after having done so .
<en> In addition , citizens are entitled to possess weapons that are family heirlooms or are used in hunting or for sporting purposes .
<en> This is all part of Europe 's tradition .
<en> All restrictions should relate to the psychological state of the individual and should also apply to people suspected of offences classed as crimes .
<en> Furthermore , I believe such restrictions should apply to people who publicly advocate Fascism and radical Communism and to extremist Islamic activists .
<en> Technology is currently available in Europe allowing anyone good with their hands to create an amateur firearm relatively quickly .
<en> The implementation of undue restrictions will not therefore prevent the criminal fraternity from possessing firearms and will unduly restrict the rights of citizens , including their right to self-defence .
<en> Our border controls must be strengthened still further , because illegal immigrants are still managing to enter Europe and weapons can be smuggled in even more easily .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , the proposed changes to the EU 's weapons directive are aimed at improving the control of weapons .
<en> There will be better labelling and more stringent requirements on trade in and the manufacture of weapons .
<en> That is good , and it is especially good that the committee wants to tighten up these requirements even further .
<en> This issue takes on particular importance , seen in the context of the tragic fatal shootings at Jokela School in Finland a few weeks ago .
<en> The combination of drifting youngsters , the spread of a culture of violence on the Internet and access to weapons is unfortunately a lethal one .
<en> That is why the tighter measures we now have to adopt are immensely important .
<en> It is also good that this is a minimum requirements directive .
<en> In other words Member States can go further and have more progressive legislation .
<en> I would like all EU legislation to be on this basis .
<en> That would solve many problems .
<en> It looks as though we can reach agreement on first reading .
<en> That is good because it enables us to save time and resources which can be devoted to something else , for example work to bring about a more peaceful and more child-friendly society .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , hunting is an old-established custom .
<en> Every Member State has its unique hunting tradition to protect .
<en> Today 's debate therefore represents the conclusion to a long process .
<en> Strong wills have opposed one another , many discussions have taken place and the shadow rapporteur has been barred from taking part in the tripartite meetings .
<en> Many of the original proposals could have threatened the hunting cultures of Member States .
<en> Regrettably , the European Firearms Pass did not suffice as the only document needed for the occasional use of hunting and marksmen 's weapons in another Member State .
<en> Freedom of movement is prevented by the fact that certain Member States are permitted to require additional documents .
<en> Huntsmen and marksmen from the Community will be subject to greater bureaucracy than persons from third countries .
<en> Fortunately fees for such permits have been prohibited .
<en> In the course of the process , as shadow rapporteur , I tried to influence the final report on those occasions when I was permitted to participate in the meetings .
<en> My work focused mainly on two questions .
<en> I was concerned to prevent a ban on ordering weapons on the Internet and to forestall changes in the availability of exemptions for schools offering training in nature management and marksmanship .
<en> In remote regions a ban on the purchase of weapons on the internet would prevent access to weapons for hunting purposes .
<en> In Sweden today we have good regulations on internet purchases , which are accepted by both the hunting community and the authorities .
<en> The second question was about the minimum age criteria , which would affect various types of upper secondary school programme .
<en> In Sweden training in hunting performs an important function in teaching future generations about hunting and game conservation .
<en> Now our hunting traditions can live on .
<en> What had been an unwieldy bureaucratic proposal has now become an acceptable , though not ideal , compromise .

<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Mr President , I would like to address the issue of minority radio broadcasting in the Slovak Republic , which is about to cease its activities .
<en> The statutory radio of the Slovak Republic is bound by law to broadcast in national minority languages .
<en> Last week , however , the management of the radio decided to stop broadcasting Rádio Pátria in minority languages on medium wave due to a lack of funds .
<en> This would mean an end to broadcasting in Hungarian , Ruthenian and Ukrainian .
<en> If the Slovak Parliament , in approving the budget for the coming year , has not allocate funds for medium wave broadcasting , broadcasting in minority languages will end on 1 January .
<en> In Slovakia this broadcasting has an 80-year-old tradition .
<en> It has also been decided that the broadcasting will continue via the Internet , although it has been estimated that only 1 % of listeners own a computer and use it to listen to the radio .
<en> There are , however , alternative solutions ...
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this weekend the European Council will also discuss energy problems , which have become the issue of common security .
<en> Against this background , let me address three wishes to the European Council .
<en> First , I would like the Council to support the Commission 's proposals on ownership unbundling and restricting the majority hold of third countries ' capital on the electricity and gas markets .
<en> This is a key issue in securing fair competition and avoiding opaque deals between state monopolies .
<en> Second , I would like Member States to be able to restrict their electricity imports from third countries in cases where this could substantially endanger long-term supply security .
<en> Third , may I remind the Council of the European Parliament resolution on energy security from September , which proposes the post of an external official for energy security ?
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , today , at the beginning of the third millennium , the world is faced with problems from the past that are still unresolved , and these are accompanied by new challenges .
<en> We can be proud that the European Union is a creator of change and that our greatest values are human rights , freedom , democracy , tolerance , a free market , an improved standard of living and care for the natural environment .
<en> If we are to act effectively to put these ideas and aims into effect , our Union must be businesslike and efficient .
<en> We are coming to the end of one particular phase of work : we are accepting the Reform Treaty , the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> This is very fine , but life has sketched new challenges for us .
<en> In implementing all the provisions of the Treaty , in upgrading the functioning of the EU and its institutions , we must talk about - and we want to talk about - the future , a better future for Europe , for our Member States ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to continue my Strasbourg tradition of naming and shaming Member States who fail to comply with the Lisbon directives .
<en> In 2005 , all 27 Member States agreed to abide by the framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-using products .
<en> By August 2007 only six Member States had declared that they had fully transposed this directive into domestic law .
<en> The Commission began infringement proceedings against 21 Member States and , to date , 15 Member States have still failed to comply with this law .
<en> So the list of shame includes : Germany , Italy , Luxembourg ( once again ) , Portugal , Malta , Cyprus , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Finland , Denmark , Estonia and Greece .
<en> In this week when the Bali conference is occurring , it is a scandal that Member States are failing to conform with measures that they have already agreed with and which could already have had a significant impact on tackling the issue of climate change .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Ladies and gentlemen , today is a turning point in the Western Balkans and also in the life of the whole European Union .
<en> Today the UN deadline passes for the Serbs and Albanians to reach agreement .
<en> We should have known in advance that the endeavours of the troika to achieve this were doomed to failure .
<en> In all probability , Kosovo will declare its independence within two months , and it is still difficult to assess the consequences of this beyond the Western Balkan region .
<en> Kosovo will be a protectorate of the Union .
<en> The Kosovo settlement will be the definitive test of common foreign and security policy .
<en> Will we be able to reach a unified position , or will we be the victims of bickering between America and Russia ?
<en> If the Union is not unified , this will pose a serious danger for the alignment and European integration of the region , so it is very important that there is a good , fair settlement in Kosovo .
<en> This is the Union 's responsibility .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Honourable Members , Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a particular honour for the European Parliament to welcome to Strasbourg today His Majesty Abdullah II , King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan .
<en> We bid Your Majesty a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> I also welcome the high-ranking delegation accompanying King Abdullah , particularly the Speakers of both Houses of the Jordanian Parliament .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> Today 's visit by the King of Jordan is the third since 2002 , when His Majesty first addressed the European Parliament .
<en> In November 2004 the King visited the Conference of Presidents in Brussels .
<en> His visit and his speech in the European Parliament today are both a sign of the strong partnership between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the European Parliament and an encouraging signal for our common future in the Mediterranean region .
<en> Your Majesty , I had prepared a far longer speech , but since we had to ask you to wait for a while , I shall cut my speech short and simply say that it is wonderful to have you here with us , and it now gives me great pleasure to invite you to address us .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan . - Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim , Mr President , Members of Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your warm welcome and , on behalf of the people of Jordan , I am honoured to come before this distinguished institution again .
<en> My friends , a changing Europe and a changing Middle East are here today .
<en> A Europe of expanding membership and a visionary mission : for cooperation across borders and growth without barriers .
<en> A Middle East of new horizons and growing hope : for peace among neighbours , opportunities for our people and a future for our youth .
<en> These trends do not take place in isolation .
<en> The achievement of the hopes of our regions will advance stability and create new possibilities for security and prosperity worldwide .
<en> It is deeply in our interest to succeed .
<en> And a critical opportunity is before us .
<en> Two weeks ago , with the support of the European Union and nations from both our regions , Israelis and Palestinians met at Annapolis .
<en> They pledged all-out negotiations toward a peace treaty in 2008 and immediate steps to implement their obligations under the Road Map .
<en> For the first time in years , we see movement towards a permanent settlement and an independent , sovereign , viable Palestinian state .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> This progress is the work of many friends of peace , including leaders in Europe and the Arab states .
<en> We believed that , after years of worsening crisis , a change of strategy was required .
<en> We urged a new commitment to the two-state goal and a targeted process that could achieve it - with tight timelines , measurable requirements and milestones for action .
<en> Second chances are rare , but I believe we have come to one .
<en> Very real challenges lie ahead , but Annapolis has created a new spark of hope .
<en> We can and must fan that spark into a blaze of confidence , action and tangible results .
<en> As our near neighbour , Europe shares our interest in solving this , the central crisis of our age .
<en> All sides respect Europe 's neutral role and model of regional progress and peace .
<en> For years , you have been our partner in the search for solutions .
<en> And you will be our partner , too , in the benefits of success : a vibrant zone of peace and prosperity throughout our shared hemisphere .
<en> These realities give Europe an important and prominent role in the future of peace .
<en> I speak especially of the European Union , and you , the voices of Europe , here in the European Parliament .
<en> And I have come here today to urge your active engagement , to seek your specific , practical skills and investment in the future , and to offer Jordan 's own commitment in the days of work that lie ahead .
<en> My friends , there are major areas where action must begin now .
<en> The first is to support the negotiations and their goal : a final settlement creating an end to conflict , security for both Palestine and Israel , and at long last , a sovereign , independent and viable Palestinian state .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> We must not underestimate the difficult days ahead .
<en> The issues are complex and decades old .
<en> Real grievances must be faced - and left behind .
<en> On the positive side , Israelis and Palestinians understand their deep , shared stake in ending the conflict .
<en> And a great amount of work has already been done .
<en> From Oslo , through the Road Map , through the Geneva Accords , and other initiatives , the parameters of the solutions are in focus .
<en> I believe the parties can get to the endgame .
<en> But for this to happen , it is vital that the international community be engaged .
<en> Europe has a unique experience of the mechanisms and process of post-conflict recovery and reconciliation .
<en> This includes creating a security framework that can offer assurance to both sides .
<en> European peacekeeping forces have played a constructive role in Lebanon .
<en> Your commitment can help bring great trust to a Palestinian-Israeli settlement .
<en> On the ground , there is a need , not only for resources but for partnership - to boost economic opportunities , create confidence that the political process works , and help create the conditions that will sustain peace .
<en> Both Palestinians and Israelis need to see tangible results , and quickly .
<en> That means security from violence and an end to occupation ; but it also means better conditions of life .
<en> In the occupied territories , the humanitarian situation for Palestinians remains dire .
<en> People need access to jobs and education , effective public services and more .
<en> Such action will provide a major infusion of hope and be a powerful counter-argument to extremist predictions that nothing can change .
<en> Next week , donor nations and institutions will meet in Paris to make commitments and plan the way forward .
<en> European nations and the European Union are already providing help , a commitment respected by people throughout the region .
<en> A second and related imperative is to understand and articulate the potential of peace .
<en> We must begin now to re-envision the future : a region where conflict has given way to cooperation , where a regional economy brings together the capabilities and resources of 22 countries - more than 300 million people , from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean - and where cross-border partnerships advance development , health , the environment and more .
<en> It is a future that empowers people to be full participants in global progress .
<en> And it will unleash a new scope of partnership with our European neighbours , in science , technology and trade .
<en> This promising future is why we must move swiftly on a comprehensive settlement , with action on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks .
<en> Indeed , the entire Arab world has recognized the importance of moving forward .
<en> The Arab peace initiative was affirmed , unanimously , last spring .
<en> And it has received the support of Muslim countries beyond the region .
<en> The opportunity is here , at long last , for a sovereign , independent , and viable Palestinian state and full , normal relations between Israel and 57 Arab and Muslim nations .
<en> This means acceptance ; acceptance by key countries , with billions of citizens , representing almost a third of the membership of the United Nations .
<en> And that opens a shared future of security , peace and new partnerships .
<en> Achieving such a peace will also make a substantial impact on other issues .
<en> Within the region , it will create new strategic space , allowing the resolution of other serious issues , from poverty to proliferation .
<en> Aggressive forces will no longer be able to exploit the Palestinian cause to serve their own ambitions and interests .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> Resources and attention will be freed to advance the region 's potential through development and reform .
<en> We in Jordan are ready to meet that future .
<en> We have pressed forward with our reform programme , despite regional instability .
<en> In the last decade , we have achieved significant gains : strong economic growth , rising per capita incomes , and a model education system .
<en> And Europe has been an important partner , through private-sector investments , as well as official assistance .
<en> Allow me to say that we deeply appreciate the support and friendship of this Parliament and the European Union .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> And we believe that in the days after peace , our partnership can only soar higher .
<en> My friends , today we can think of a larger neighbourhood , one that stretches from north of the Baltic Sea to south of the Mediterranean , one that is shared by Europe and the Middle East .
<en> It is the basis of the Euromed partnership , our region-to-region platform for cooperation and development .
<en> It is a relationship with great shared interests and unlimited potential .
<en> And it is up to us to develop our partnership to its fullest .
<en> Today , young Europeans are coming to adulthood who never knew a divided Europe .
<en> Their young counterparts , Palestinian and Israeli , have no such positive experience .
<en> They have grown up in a world of division and conflict .
<en> Now , together , we have an opportunity to remove the barriers to their future , and leave the past behind .
<en> Today , the European Parliament represents significantly more Member States than when I spoke before Parliament only five years ago .
<en> That is the result of a region-wide commitment to increase the zone of partnership and progress .
<en> The Middle East is tackling the same important task .
<en> Now , together , we can help that work succeed .
<en> Today , a renewed peace process has begun .
<en> We have seen such beginnings fail in the past .
<en> But this time , a unique confluence of events has created new openings for success .
<en> Now , together , we can and we must , fulfil the promise of peace .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> My friends , we in Jordan know that when an olive tree takes life , planting is only the first step .
<en> A hundred processes are then activated to create the cells and structures of life .
<en> Roots emerge , growth occurs , and a core of strength ensures survival .
<en> From outside comes water and support to sustain life and create new fruit .
<en> In the arena of the Middle East , a new olive branch has just been planted .
<en> Now the real work must begin .
<en> It is in our hands to create the process and structures that will give peace roots , help it grow and sustain it into the future .
<en> I urge you to share in this effort .
<en> Our partnership can create an historic transformation and a rich harvest - years of peace and prosperity that will benefit our peoples and our world .
<en> ( The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation )
<sp>
<en> Your Majesty , we thank you for your visit to the European Parliament .
<en> We thank you for this great speech .
<en> We are all - and the applause showed this - deeply touched by your convictions .
<en> There are few personalities , few leaders , who are as committed as you to peace in the Middle East .
<en> You call us friends , and I say to you , on behalf of the European Parliament : We are at your side to create a Palestinian State that can live in safety ...
<en> ( Applause )
<en> ... and to have a State of Israel that can live in safety .
<en> We in the European Parliament believe in the dignity of the human being , and the dignity of the human being applies to each human being in this world .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> Your Majesty , we want close cooperation with your country and you are one of the very few who have visited the European Parliament more than once .
<en> We in the European Parliament and the European Union want a strong partnership , relationship and , if possible , friendship with all countries in the Middle East .
<en> We are at your side .
<en> Let us work together .
<en> Shukran jazilan .
<en> Thank you , Your Majesty .

<en> ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in consideration of the formal sitting with the King of Jordan , all my fellow chairs of the political groups have no doubt been unable to take the opportunity to make a statement under our Rules of Procedure about the preceding occurrences .
<en> I should like to do that now .
<en> I believe I speak on behalf of many Members when I express my thanks first of all to the President of this House , to Mr Barroso and to Mr Sócrates for the dignified way in which they defended this solemn act , the signing of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
<en> They had the overwhelming majority of this House behind them .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> There are , however , two things I wish to say to the House , and I say them entirely in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group .
<en> I speak for myself .
<en> I should like to draw the attention of the House to a matter to which I am privy as chair of a political group .
<en> It is not normal practice to report on the deliberations of the Conference of Presidents , but you should certainly know , ladies and gentlemen , that the only group chairman who asked at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents for an invitation to attend the formal signing of the Treaty in Lisbon was Mr Bonde .
<en> I believe the House should know that .
<en> No other group chair made that request .
<en> Mr Bonde , who makes such a racket here , was determined to be there at the signing of the Treaty .
<en> These are the kind of double standards we have to live with here .
<en> Another comment I wish to make is that I learned at grammar school in Germany about the way in which the tactic of collective chanting was used to shout down political opponents in the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic .
<en> The political group that introduced the practice was the one led by Adolf Hitler .
<en> Today 's occurrences reminded me of that .
<en> Thank you .
<en> ( Loud applause )
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) I shall be quite brief .
<en> I too was extremely shocked earlier today .
<en> This is a debating chamber where democracy rules , and there is no need for a carry-on such as we witnessed this morning for the benefit of the TV cameras .
<en> Communication is something to which all of us here are entitled .
<en> To those responsible for this morning 's commotion in a chamber dedicated to democracy and freedom , I would simply say that they behaved disgracefully .
<en> We will discuss it again this afternoon in the Conference of Presidents , with a view to preventing any deterioration of the situation .
<en> ( Loud applause )

<sp>
<2en> In 1918 , independent Montenegro voluntarily chose unification with the neighbouring countries of Serbia , Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia .
<2en> In 2006 , after the break-up of Yugoslavia , the electorate of Montenegro , the last state to remain united with Serbia , decided democratically to end this union .
<2en> This made Montenegro the 49th independent state in Europe .
<2en> Now it is important that Montenegro become a normal state , rather than a larger version of Monaco : a paradise for rich foreigners wishing to pay low taxes , launder money and build palaces .
<2en> Montenegro must do more to combat environmental pollution and cigarette smuggling .
<2en> I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my amendments concerning housing and jobs for Serbian and Kosovar refugees .
<2en> Stateless persons cannot remain stateless for ever , and Montenegro must respect the agreements of the Council of Europe in this regard .
<2en> Even my proposal regarding the restoration of the north-south railway connections to Nikšić on the Bosnian border and Shkoder in Albania has been accepted .
<2en> Increasing road transport is not a valid solution .
<2en> Fortunately , the rapporteur , Mr Vernola - unlike in his previous annual report - is not calling for swift accession to NATO , nor an economic policy that is even more neoliberal than is usual in the rest of Europe .
<2en> Accession to NATO cannot be a prerequisite for admission to the EU .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The resolution adopted today in the European Parliament expresses solidarity with the victims of the shipwrecks that occurred in the Kerch Strait - that is , the Strait linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov - causing an environmental disaster .
<en> The environmental impact of the spillage of oil derivatives into the strait was exacerbated by the rapid dispersion of the pollutants due to the strong winds and high waves at the time .
<en> In general , we agree with the positions contained in the resolution , stressing the important role of Member States in ensuring that ships on their national registers conform to international standards and in preventing maritime accidents and combating the consequences of such accidents .
<en> Agreeing with the need to implement measures to reduce the environmental risk and to make progress in maritime safety , we think that any initiative taken at EU level in this framework should be based on enhanced cooperation between Member States , without compromising their responsibilities in this area .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The enlargement of the European Union calls for our solidarity with the population of the 431 000 km2 around the Black Sea .
<en> This solidarity is expressed by the agreement to open negotiations with Turkey , the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy with Georgia and Ukraine , and the strategic partnership established with Russia .
<en> The violence of the storm makes us think about the effects of climate change , in our own neighbourhood too .
<en> A risk management policy is required that combines both prevention and the protection of biodiversity .
<en> We remember that the storm trapped four vessels and caused the death of eight sailors .
<en> A Russian cargo vessel also broke in two , releasing 4 000 tonnes of fuel oil on a migration route for diving birds coming from Siberia .
<en> The European Union sent a team within the framework of the Monitoring and Information Centre .
<en> More should be done as part of this initiative .
<en> To prevent future disasters , the EU must make sure that high safety standards are systematically applied to the fleet of Russian vessels .
<en> The EU must impose the use of double-hull cargo vessels on its Russian partner , for transporting oil .
<en> As the parliamentary assembly of the BSEC meets , we should be demanding the application of the standards in the European maritime safety package .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I am voting in favour of Mr Ehler 's report on deposit-guarantee schemes .
<en> The rapporteur has presented a very good report , in which attention is drawn to the new challenges facing guarantee schemes because of the increasing integration of markets .
<en> These challenges must be responded to if the stability of financial markets is to be ensured .
<en> Deposit-guarantee schemes are a very important part in the EU financial market system and their operation should continuously be improved .
<en> The rapporteur rightly draws attention to the problem of crisis management and the safety net for cross-border deposits in crisis management .
<en> I agree that crisis management should rest on the foundations of improved early risk detection , better defined and planned procedures of interaction between all parties involved , and clarification of the point at which burdens are to be shared .
<en> Differences between systems and the variety of parties involved in the public and private sectors must be taken into consideration .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Mass imports , the perverse role played by a strong euro against a deliberately undervalued foreign currency , social and environmental dumping , counterfeits , piracy , dangerous products , and the existence of non-tariff barriers that hit European manufacturing : in the textiles sector as in others , every report and resolution by this Parliament on trade relations with China looks the same .
<en> Why was China 's membership of the WTO accepted under these circumstances ?
<en> We voted against it .
<en> Why refuse to see that liberalising trade with countries that have decided not to obey the rules - and you never challenge this liberalisation - only leads to economic disaster and social disintegration for whole regions and sectors ?
<en> Why accept the end of textile quotas and the laying off of tens of thousands of European workers ?
<en> You are worried about it now , but you only talk timidly of possible means of commercial defence , safeguard measures and joint surveillance of exports .
<en> It is not much , and it is not enough , but it is better than nothing .
<en> Therefore , though this resolution is about as useful as a chocolate teapot , we will vote in favour .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item on the agenda are the six motions for a resolution on eastern Chad .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( PL ) Madam President , I would like to say that I am very disturbed by the intensification of fighting in Chad , but also by the lack of progress in finding a political solution to the conflict .
<en> I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the role of the EUFOR TCHAD / RCA operation .
<en> The main aim of the European initiative , which is also supported by the UN , is to ensure security in the humanitarian zone .
<en> Bearing in mind the ongoing Darfur crisis and the way in which it is destabilising the situation in the region , it is worth remembering here that the conflict has already crossed the borders of Chad and the Central African Republic .
<en> I believe it is vital to put neutral forces from the Member States in place as soon as possible .
<en> I would like to stress , though , that the success of such a peace mission is heavily dependent on the political efforts that must be made if a successful peace process is to be conducted .
<sp>
<en> author . - Madam President , I want to make a couple of important and essential points .
<en> There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad .
<en> There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see , but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission .
<en> The first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation 's mandate .
<en> We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort .
<en> If that is indeed so , then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send .
<en> I believe that clarity is lacking .
<en> I do not believe - and I have to disagree with my colleague - that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security .
<en> We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict .
<en> We have also heard from leaders of many of the rebel groups that any intervention , and this intervention in particular , will be considered hostile .
<en> That poses a huge difficulty .
<en> I must also say - and , again , I disagree with my colleague - that the troops as currently configured will not act as the neutral force that is required .
<en> I have to say , with the greatest of respect for France and her people , that to load the mission so much towards France verges on the provocative , and I think it deeply unwise .
<en> I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy .
<en> The difficulties that have arisen - in this instance in relation to Chad - reflect very clearly why .
<en> I think it is undoable , because we have very different traditions and histories and very different foreign policy goals and outlooks .
<en> For this reason in particular it is a great shame - if I may say so , coming from a country that is still at least nominally militarily neutral - that the obligations , responsibilities and capacities of militarily neutral states are not recognised sufficiently in the European Union , and particularly not in the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> I believe that countries with that tradition could make the kind of valued intervention based on neutrality that my colleague has mentioned .
<en> To conclude , intervention in Chad is necessary .
<en> However , the essential thing is how we go about this .
<en> Any operation has to be focused .
<en> It certainly has to be neutral and , above all , it must have prospects of success .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I notice that there is no time displayed on the board .
<en> Does that mean we will have the privilege of unlimited use of time this afternoon , or is there a technical error ?
<sp>
<en> Mr Matsakis , we shall all abide by the time we know has been given us .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , on a point of order , I was probably the first person to apply this afternoon under the ' catch-the-eye ' procedure .
<en> I do not know why you denied me the opportunity to speak .
<en> Indeed , you gave an extra opportunity to one of my colleagues who had already spoken in the debate .
<en> You then gave him more time !
<en> I had no disagreement with what he said .
<en> It was just the procedure that you followed , and I think it was quite wrong that you denied me the opportunity to speak .
<en> I wanted to make the point that we need a stable and reliable government in Pakistan .
<sp>
<en> ? - Mr Van Orden , I was informed that you had already spoken today under the catch-the-eye procedure and , therefore , having regard to the rules which were drawn up to ensure that Members ' speeches covered as broad a spectrum as possible , I took my decision which obviously left you out this time .
<en> I would , however , remind you that there will be other occasions when you will have the opportunity to speak .
<en> In any case , you have been placed on the list and that will certainly be respected .
<en> We must continue , otherwise we shall not have time for questions .
<en> I am sorry , but we cannot continue this dialogue .
<en> Therefore , the next item is questions to the Council .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , what you have just said is incorrect .
<en> The previous ' catch-your-eye ' opportunity was because there was no one else that wanted to catch the eye , so it seemed to be an opportunity .
<en> I had specifically asked to speak in this Pakistan debate .
<en> I put it in writing and I indicated throughout the debate that I wanted to speak .
<en> There was no excuse , therefore , for denying me that opportunity , and I had important comments that I wanted to make .
<en> I am afraid that I am very disappointed in the way that you have conducted this particular meeting .
<sp>
<en> Your protest is noted , Mr Van Orden .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Could I just ask the Council to comment on the fact that the Commission is now reviewing the targets for biofuels , because what we thought might be good for climate change is now having unintended consequences when it comes to global food security , and indeed biodiversity .
<en> Is this not one of the difficulties for us human beings in tackling climate change : that we may get it wrong ?
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office . - ( SL ) This is proof that , perhaps , certain matters did not receive our due attention in the past .
<en> It is clear that the totally unsupervised and unrestrained production of biofuels must have possible negative consequences for the environment , biodiversity , food prices , and so on .
<en> I think it is fitting to devote special attention to that aspect too .
<en> In other words , we should encourage the production and consumption of biofuels to reduce rather than increase the burden on the environment .
<en> I think that should be a major guide for the Union in its policies to encourage the use of biofuels .
<sp>
<en> Subject : Moving beyond GDP
<en> Could the Council indicate how it intends to work with the Commission proposal to move beyond GDP as an indicator of regional cohesion , and could it say whether it has arrived at any definitive measures to be included in the future , to provide a more accurate measure of a region 's performance ?
<en> Mrs McGuinness takes responsibility for this question originally asked by Jim Higgins .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office . - ( SL ) I would like to apologise to Mr Higgins and Ms McGuinness for my answer , which cannot be anything other than very short , because the Council can only discuss these things on the basis of a proposal by the Commission .
<en> Such a proposal has not been put forward , nor has a proposal for any other changes regarding regional cohesion indicators .
<en> Therefore , until such a proposal is made , the Council is unable to discuss it and take a position on any other regional cohesion indicators .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , can I apologise on behalf of Mr Higgins , who is unwell this evening and cannot be here .
<en> I thank you for your short answer .
<en> I presume this will be linked with plans to redefine disadvantaged areas in Member States as well .
<en> Could I just suggest that , when you do have some information on some of the indicators , you might supply it to Mr Higgins .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group warmly welcomes the content of Mr Schlyter 's report , which is to be commended for its sensitive , yet highly practical , approach .
<en> Members of the public find it almost impossible to understand just how it is that we can allow fish to be caught and then thrown back dead into the sea .
<en> Fishermen too have major concerns with the fact that this kind of action is , to some extent , forced upon them , for the current combination of rules and technical possibilities means that some fish are simply not wanted on board .
<en> Sometimes this is because they are of insufficient economic value .
<en> We must make an early and concerted effort to prevent the kind of discarding that results from attempts at high grading .
<en> I suspect that there is already less temptation to this practice in those fisheries where days at sea are limited .
<en> Sometimes , though , discarding is the outcome of conditions we ourselves impose , for example minimum landing sizes , and restrictions on quotas .
<en> Of course , if we are serious about conservation , we need total allowable catches .
<en> But , in my own view , we need to look seriously at the methods we employ to keep fishing within the limits that are set by those TACs , to determine amongst other things , just how far there is an interconnection between the establishment of quotas and the problem of discards , particularly where mixed fisheries are concerned .
<en> This , as well as the adoption of the measures suggested in the report , must of course be undertaken with the full engagement of stakeholders .
<en> Without that , we cannot hope for success .
<en> The industry is already leading the way .
<en> I am particularly proud of the Scots , for their voluntary system of real-time closures .
<en> We need proper incentives to positive actions of this kind for a great deal remains to be done .
<en> I trust that Parliament will give its full support to the report and that the Commission and Council will take matters forward in the manner it recommends .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( GA ) Mr President , I should like to say that I approve of this report ; to my mind , the rapporteur has worked out a practical , comprehensive approach to the problem of fisheries discards at sea .
<en> But things are not so easy , and everyone is thinking about the new methods to be applied .
<en> It is time to put an end to the volumes of talk about this matter and take action .
<en> There are plenty of practical suggestions in the report and they could be put into operation .
<en> The one thing that we definitely cannot do is to do nothing .
<en> We have to act for as long as fisheries discards pose a problem .
<en> I should also like to ask the Commission ensure that small fishermen do not incur any additional cost on account of measures to resolve the problem of these discards .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) has been a miserable failure .
<en> It has failed to conserve stocks , it has failed to sustain our fishing-dependent communities and it has failed to win public support or credibility .
<en> One of the main reasons for that is the scandal of discarding .
<en> The CFP quota system itself is a direct cause of discarding .
<en> It does not measure the amount of fish caught ; it only measures the amount of fish landed .
<en> That said , I broadly welcome this report by Mr Schlyter .
<en> In particular , I strongly agree with the principle of positive incentives giving some reward to those fishermen who take steps to reduce or eliminate discards .
<en> I also agree that measures must be tailored to different types of fishery .
<en> It has long been a major flaw of the CFP that it has been over-centralised and inflexible .
<en> I draw attention to paragraph 15 , which welcomes the voluntary real-time closure scheme introduced by Scotland , an excellent example of the kind of initiative which should be encouraged and incentivised by the CFP at least for as long as we are stuck with it as a management measure .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , discards are just one aspect of the nightmare that is the CFP .
<en> The EU , through its ill thought-out policy , is destroying livelihoods in developing nations across the world .
<en> The export of fish is significantly more important to the developing world in trade terms than other commodities such as rice , coffee and tea .
<en> Mauritania , for example , is dependent on its fishing industry for half of its exports , which represent 15 % of its GDP .
<en> But , having devastated Mauritanian waters , the Commission now wants to dump its deal .
<en> It does not think that these now sterile waters are worth EUR 86 million a year .
<en> This denunciation of a fisheries agreement is supposed to be a secret ; well , it was until now .
<en> I think African people should know about the EU 's shabby and dishonourable plans .
<en> It is colonialism at its most vicious , and I accuse these institutions of racism and exploitation of vulnerable societies .
<en> President Barroso 's non-imperial empire is not as benign as he would have us believe , so , if you want to move forward , discard Giscard and dump the Lisbon Treaty as well as the CFP .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , the scandal of discards is one of the EU 's own making .
<en> Impossible quotas and restrictions are imposed in mixed fisheries , prohibited stocks are inevitably caught and in consequence they are dumped back - dead - into the sea .
<en> And all this while hunger prevails in many parts of the world .
<en> For years the EU has wrung its hands over this but , frankly , has done nothing to stop it .
<en> Such fish , I believe , should be landed ; they should be sold at a fixed price , sufficiently low to discourage deliberate catching and sufficiently high to make their landing worthwhile .
<en> Also , it is sensible and right that we should reward the use of more selective fishing gear .
<en> But I do most positively reject any blanket discard ban as translating into yet another device of driving more of our fishermen out of business .
<en> We have ruminated on this issue for years .
<en> Now is the time , at last , to do something about it .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , next Sunday , on 24 February , Estonians will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of their independent statehood .
<en> In spite of being a relatively young state , Estonia has been part of European cultural heritage and shared values since the 13th century .
<en> However , a special feature of the 90 years since the proclamation of independence that we share with our neighbours - Latvians and Lithuanians - is that we have enjoyed freedom for only 39 years , because of foreign occupations .
<en> Therefore , I would like to recall one important fact : exactly 25 years ago , the European Parliament , as the first European institution to do so , reacted to the appeal of 45 freedom fighters from Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia , and adopted a resolution supporting the idea of restoring sovereignty to the three occupied Baltic nations .
<en> I would like to thank all previous and current Members of the European Parliament who courageously expressed solidarity with the three Baltic nations .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics , the focus of the international community is on China 's record for violations of human rights .
<en> However , we must not forget that other species , primarily the tigers , are suffering too .
<en> Their numbers are being devastated due to huge demand - largely from China - for tiger-related products .
<en> The cause of their looming extinction is the illegal poaching of tigers in India .
<en> Even in reserves , keepers have been shot to get at the tigers .
<en> These are then illegally transported across the border to China .
<en> It is estimated that one tiger is killed every day .
<en> At this rate the tiger will be virtually extinct within the next five years .
<en> I welcome the news last week that the Indian Government plans to create eight new reserves to protect their dwindling population of tigers .
<en> Nevertheless , it will take five years to set up new reserves , and in the last five years the population of tigers has already dropped by over 50 % .
<en> Therefore , unless the European Union and international community take urgent action in curbing demand and tackling illegal poaching and trafficking , and changing attitudes in China on tiger-related products , the new reserves will be too little too late .
<en> Finally , I hope you will support me on Tiger Protection Awareness Day .

<en> ( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , the blatantly racist comments made by Mr Silvio Berlusconi last week , in which he called for zero tolerance towards Roma , illegal immigrants and criminals , are shocking and unacceptable .
<en> In a statement yesterday , Mr Francesco Storace , who is running for mayor of the Italian capital , spoke of ' denomadising ' Rome , thereby making it clear that Roma have no place in the eternal city .
<en> Can these statements be happening just 18 days after the European Parliament adopted a resolution on a European Strategy on the Roma ?
<en> I would ask my fellow Members from Italy to explain to their colleagues at home why it was that we supported this resolution , the objectives it contains that we formulated together , and why abusing Gypsies is inappropriate in the 21st century .
<en> The open letter published by me in connection with these anti-Romani statements was signed by a total of 72 Roma non-governmental organisations including 33 in Italy , 12 in Hungary , 9 in Macedonia , 4 in Romania , 3 in Turkey , 2 in Moldova , 5 in Bulgaria , and 2 in France .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , Mr Alexander Milinkiewicz , the leader of the opposition in Belarus , has been detained once again in Minsk today .
<en> Mr Milinkiewicz is a Sakharov laureate .
<en> The European Parliament awarded him this prize in 2006 .
<en> Mrs Olga Kazulin has also been detained .
<en> She is the wife of Mr Alexander Kazulin , a prominent opponent of Mr Lukaszenko .
<en> Mr Milinkiewicz took part in a demonstration organised by private entrepreneurs , whose freedom of action has been restricted by new provisions increasing their tax burden and restricting their freedom to employ workers .
<en> It was not the first demonstration in which this social group had expressed its discontent .
<en> The march organisers were also detained and interrogated along with Mr Milinkiewicz and Mrs Kazulin , who had not participated in the march .
<en> How many times has Europe watched passively whilst the one of its own laureates was detained ?
<en> How many times have human rights been violated with impunity just beyond the Union 's eastern border ?

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , last week the Polish media reported the story of Karolina , a young girl whose life has been ruined by her former boyfriend .
<en> Without her knowledge or consent , the boyfriend recorded their shared private experiences and posted the recordings on the Internet after the end of their relationship .
<en> Karolina 's family and friends received e-mails containing pornographic material .
<en> As she is not a minor , Karolina is not protected under Polish law and the perpetrator of this action remains unpunished .
<en> The Polish authorities have undertaken to change the law at the earliest opportunity , so as to protect individuals whose privacy and dignity have been violated in this way .
<en> The Internet transcends national borders , however , and there is no common Union legislation to deter potential perpetrators and penalise those who commit actions of this kind .
<en> I appeal to the Commission and to the Member States to combat such behaviour , which could be described as rape over the Internet .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I will resist the temptation to join in .
<en> I would like to thank the rapporteur for the detailed work on this report .
<en> Let us be honest , this is not the stuff that people talk about in public houses and on social occasions .
<en> But getting our customs laws right is very important for business and for jobs , and that is why we are doing it .
<en> So the idea of centralised clearance makes good sense , if it works - and let us hope that it does , under these new rules .
<en> Also , the idea of a single window has potential to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy .
<en> But can I make just one point : let us take feedback , when this all is up and running , from the economic operators , and be willing to adjust it where we see problems which have been identified by other speakers this evening .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , my point of departure is that I am not only pleased but also very proud that we have reached this point , because I agree with all those speakers who consider it a very great achievement for the Union as a whole .
<en> First of all , I would like to express my thanks for your support for the Modernised Customs Code and for your interest in future developments .
<en> As you have recalled , the adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Code will not be the end of the story , since its application will depend on the finalisation and application of its implementing provisions .
<en> The new regulatory procedure with scrutiny will be used for the adoption of these provisions .
<en> It will give Parliament the possibility to check the way the Commission intends to implement in detail , with the assistance of the Customs Code Committee , the general provisions resulting from the Code .
<en> Besides this procedural requirement , the Commission intends to keep Parliament , through its Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , properly informed about the state of preparation of the draft implementing measures and the time-schedule envisaged for the application of the Modernised Customs Code .
<en> Concerning the problem of Switzerland and the European Union , which Mr Schwab raised , on 1 July 2009 the security amendment to the Community Customs Code will be fully implemented .
<en> This means that all goods entering or leaving the Community shall be the subject of a pre-arrival or pre-departure declaration .
<en> The Authorised Economic Operator will benefit from the facilitations envisaged in the Code .
<en> As with other third countries , we are currently negotiating with Switzerland on the mutual recognition of control centres , the results of controls and the status of Authorised Economic Operator .
<en> The negotiations are ongoing , and we are looking for a mutually satisfactory solution to be in place by 1 July 2009 .
<en> Now let me finish by inviting you to join the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union on 1 July 2008 .
<en> The Customs Union was the first cornerstone in building the internal market and remains one of its essential components .
<en> I am looking forward to continuing our discussion about the future role of customs in the context of the celebrations .
<en> Thank you very much , once again , for your support .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , I would like to thank all those who have spoken and all those who have contributed to the drafting of this report .
<en> Since Mr Medina Ortega has spoken about smuggling I cannot resist the urge to bring up the subject of counterfeiting .
<en> Between 1998 and 2004 the number of arrests for counterfeiting rose by 1 000 % .
<en> This just goes to show that the controls currently in place need to be updated and a new approach adopted as far as the duties of customs officials are concerned .
<en> I also wish to pay tribute to the professionals themselves , who have displayed a real openness of mind , and I would like to say to them that I still feel a debt of gratitude towards them .
<en> This will no doubt answer the concerns voiced by Mrs McGuinness .
<en> As far as the implementing measures are concerned , I will do my best to encourage dialogue between the customs authorities and the Community institutions , including the Commission , with which there has always been a good measure of close and productive cooperation .
<en> I therefore call on you to support the common position and would conclude by thanking you all for your attention .
<sp>
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on 19 February 2008 .

<en> Madam President , a partnership between the EU and Central Asia is long overdue , and I congratulate Mr Özdemir on his report .
<en> This vast and strategically vital region is being pulled three ways : by China , by Russia and by Europe .
<en> It is essential that we do all we can to ensure that central Asia 's rational choice is partnership with the European Union .
<en> Turkmenistan 's gradual emergence from isolation provides the EU with a crucial window of opportunity .
<en> Ensuring regular , reliable supplies of ample Turkmen hydrocarbon resources will diminish Europe 's current overdependence on Russia .
<en> This will require a new trans-Caspian pipeline to link up with the Nabucco project .
<en> Uzbekistan , which was rightfully ostracised following the Andijan massacre , has begun to engage in dialogue on human rights with the EU .
<en> This is a considerable step forward .
<en> Clearly there is much progress still to be made before Uzbekistan can be considered a properly democratic country .
<en> However , Uzbekistan is a vital ally in the war on international terrorism , especially with regard to Afghanistan .
<en> For the EU , Kazakhstan should be considered the jewel in the crown of central Asia .
<en> The country 's vast oil , gas and mineral resources , including uranium , are an obvious attraction .
<en> Although Kazakhstan is not a western liberal democracy in our tradition , it is making considerable progress as a multi-religious , secular , Muslim-majority country .
<en> Given the fact that only 17 years ago it was a republic of the Soviet Union , Kazakhstan 's presidency of the OSCE in 2010 will further consolidate the momentum towards greater political freedom and human rights in that country .
<en> As rapporteur of the eastern dimension of the ENP , I once suggested that Kazakhstan might one day become a member of the ENP .
<en> I believe that something rather like this arrangement , one day , will come to pass .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , my compliments too to the rapporteur , Cem Özdemir .
<en> It is a pity that most of the population of Central Asia will probably have gone to sleep ages ago .
<en> The European Union has long neglected Central Asia .
<en> The strategy now devised is a welcome step towards plugging that gap .
<en> As many speakers have said , the Union has considerable interests in the region .
<en> We are opting for a realistic strategy that takes a cohesive view of the various facets of our relationship with Central Asia and developments there .
<en> As our EU Special Representative , Pierre Morel , has said on countless occasions , there is no way an energy dialogue can develop unless we help with the construction of properly-functioning states .
<en> And properly-functioning states mean democratisation .
<en> There is no guarantee that the new strategy will succeed .
<en> That will depend very much on how it is implemented .
<en> We are looking above all to the European Commission to flesh out the strategy in practice .
<en> Of course the issue of human rights must not be lost sight of in all this .
<en> On Uzbekistan , I stand by my view that we must remain tough in our dealings with that country until such time as the regime there clearly signals that it is genuinely ready to move towards democracy .
<en> Kazakhstan , an important point .
<en> I share the general view that this country is pivotal in the region .
<en> I do not agree with Mr Tannock that it should be included in the ENP , but we ought to look at ways of improving our relationship with Kazakhstan .
<en> I have been there myself and was impressed by the country 's energy - not just economically but also socially .
<en> I am glad that agreement has been reached on whether or not Kazakhstan can take on the chairmanship of the OSCE .
<en> I am glad too that that agreement , that decision , comes with a few conditions attached .
<en> We can keep an eye on Kazakhstan in the years ahead to see if it meets those conditions .
<en> One final comment .
<en> There are all kinds of things we can do in Central Asia .
<en> But only if we also bear in mind the role of Russia and China in the region .
<en> So in our policy towards Russia and China we must also think about the form that our growing interest in that region should take .
<en> When I was there , in Kazakhstan , I learned that to them China and Russia are not their only major partners ; they also want closer ties with the European Union .
<en> Our new strategy may prove a very good response to that .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Özdemir for preparing this very comprehensive report .
<en> As chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the Central Asian countries , and in connection with this resolution , I would like to address a few issues which I consider important .
<en> Firstly , Central Asia has an obvious growing importance for the European Union and the world as a whole , no doubt owing to its rich energy resources .
<en> We have many shared interests in promoting security and tackling threats such as terrorism and drug-smuggling .
<en> I am glad that the European Union 's strategy for a new partnership with Central Asia addresses those matters very firmly , as does as this resolution .
<en> This region occupies a crucial geostrategic position , particularly as it shares a border with Afghanistan , China and Russia .
<en> Therefore , we must clearly define our objectives and priorities , bearing in mind this context .
<en> In 2010 , Kazakhstan will become the presiding country of the OSCE , which is responsible for ensuring democracy and fundamental human rights .
<en> I am pleased for my colleagues , but I worry about the people of Kazakhstan , where the current elected Parliament does not include a single opposition member .
<en> All the countries of Central Asia still have a long way to go on the road to economic and political reform and the building of democratic societies .
<en> The example of the former Soviet republics , including my country , Lithuania , shows that 17 years of independence is not long enough to fully achieve real change .
<en> However , we must deliver our overriding message , which is that Europe will not seek material benefits at the expense of human values .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , the achievement of independence almost 20 years ago by the Central Asia countries discussed in Mr Özdemir 's report brought a complete culture change after years of enslavement .
<en> Obviously , these countries used their newfound freedom in line with past practice and habits .
<en> Change is hard to achieve in such a short time .
<en> These nations endured through the centuries thanks to cultural difference based on long tradition .
<en> That is something we should and must respect .
<en> Change must come slowly , so as not to arouse hostility to our own culture and expectations .
<en> Economic ties with the Russian Federation remained after independence , and are still strong .
<en> Russian culture , its science and its economy had an enormous influence on what are now independent states .
<en> Unless we build alternative ties with the European Union we are bound to fail , despite the expectations which these countries have of us .
<en> We must start with the economy : let us replace Russian pipelines by ours , Russian technical plant by ours and the Russian language by English .
<en> That will bring about a systematic change in culture .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , this report expresses concern that the new Kyrgyz Constitution , voted on in a referendum in October 2007 without wide-ranging debate , could alter the balance of power .
<en> The Kyrgyz Constitution was amended in a controversial referendum in 1996 , and in 2003 there was another referendum which approved further constitutional change .
<en> The report goes on to deprecate , in the Central Asian republics , the ' anxiety to maintain internal control ' , which ' is a given in regimes which show little interest in seeking popular consent on which to base their rule ' .
<en> Hang on a moment , who are we talking about here ?
<en> Constitutional change that will ' alter the balance of power ' .
<en> ' Anxiety to maintain internal control ' , with ' little interest in seeking popular consent ' on which to base the rule of a political elite .
<en> This sounds like an extract from a UK Independence Party report on the European Constitution - sorry , I mean the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> I doubt that the five Central Asian republics are models of democracy and the rule of law , but at least when the politicians of Kyrgyzstan wanted to change the constitution , they had the decency to ask the people for their approval in a referendum .
<en> That is something the European Union has had neither the decency nor the courage to do of the European people .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - In this report on the Treaty of Lisbon we clearly see that the Treaty will bolster the democratic credentials of the EU .
<en> With greater involvement from both National and European Parliaments in decision-making procedures , we are giving the European people what they have always asked of the EU : a greater voice .
<en> The Treaty 's focus on efficient and coherent policy-making , highlighted in the report , will give us the ability to face ever tougher global challenges .
<en> I voted in favour of this report and would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on what is an excellent report on a very sensitive and pivotal issue for the future of the Union .
<sp>
<2en> The hallmark of the draft Constitution voted down by two Member States in 2005 was that it responded to the desires of big business , national governments and the majority in national parliaments , but had little support among voters .
<2en> The referendums in the few countries that held one revealed that intense public debate and high turnout lead to many dissenting votes .
<2en> People do not want Europe imposing decisions on them that they themselves would never have wanted to take .
<2en> They do see Europe as useful in resolving cross-border problems peacefully and in tackling large-scale problems that individual Member States cannot solve alone , but they do not see the use of a Europe that increasingly takes the place of the country in which they live .
<2en> The Constitution was a case of tied selling of good and bad things , without the opportunity to edit out the bad points in the fields of the economy and armament .
<2en> The new Treaty still bears a strong resemblance to the Constitution .
<2en> Rejection of referendums reflects fear of the electorate .
<2en> The adoption of the amended Constitution by a clear majority today conveys a clear message : ' People keep out ; this Europe is for professional politicians only ' .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The EU and its deeply unpopular Treaty cannot hide behind its demagogic claims to be more democratic and social .
<en> Imperialist infighting has been temporarily covered up in order to launch an even greater onslaught on workers ' rights and freedoms , and to stage an increase in monopoly profits .
<en> The report on the Lisbon Treaty and the renamed European Constitution is a call for EC legislation to combat the opposition of workers in the Member States .
<en> The alliance of EU political supporters , including the New Democracy and PASOK parties , do not want referendums because they are aware of the opposition of the workers who suffer barbarous capitalism and imperialist aggression .
<en> The Lisbon Treaty and the European Constitution strengthen the EU so that it can operate more efficiently and benefit European monopolies .
<en> As a result , the Lisbon Convention and the European Constitution :
<en> strengthen the unpopular arming of the EU ,
<en> promote capitalist restructuring ,
<en> develop new policies for exploiting workers and infringing their social rights ,
<en> intensify the militarisation of the EU ,
<en> adopt the dogma of preventive war ,
<en> ratify imperialist interventions , even in Member States ,
<en> restrict the sovereign rights of Member States ,
<en> abolish the right of veto to the benefit of the stronger countries ,
<en> boost and create new mechanisms of repression ,
<en> further restrict individual rights and people 's freedoms .
<en> The workers of the EU have the power to condemn the European Treaty and the EU itself .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The Lisbon Treaty is a step backwards compared with the European Constitution .
<en> The former has jettisoned none of its neo-liberal cargo : there is absolutely no concept of democratic accountability at the European Central Bank , the Stability and Growth Pact is one-sided and the free market is championed .
<en> At the request of Mr Brown and the Kaczyński brothers , the Lisbon Treaty has rejected certain positive symbols freely available to each state , such as flags and anthems .
<en> The binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been distorted by an opt-out clause .
<en> We have called for referendums to strengthen public dialogue and citizen participation .
<en> Refusing to hold referendums shows how much of a gap there is between the European elite and the hopes and needs of European citizens , and Euro-indifference and Euro-scepticism are strengthened .
<en> We , the SYN ( Coalition of the Left ) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , say no to this Treaty : in our daily struggles we are clearing a different path for the EU .
<en> We want to be more part of Europe .
<en> The Europe we crave is politically more united ; it has a stronger social and environmental policy , with a substantially increased Community budget , without relinquishing control over the ECB .
<en> Such a Europe is active and independent in its handling of the problems of world peace ; it is not at the beck and call of President Bush .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The Lisbon Treaty will make a militaristic Europe possible .
<en> Previous EC and EU treaties do not allow a permanent EU military budget , but the ' start-up fund ' ( Article 28 paragraph 3 ) now pays for operational EU military spending .
<en> In addition to the individual states ' military budgets , it provides for the EU to have a military budget of its own .
<en> Article 28c paragraph 3 contains the much-criticised mutual aid and assistance obligation to be implemented via a European Defence Agency ( Article 28 ) .
<en> Institutional collaboration between the EU and NATO is stipulated in the Treaty ( Article 28a paragraph 7 ) .
<en> The right of the Bundestag to decide whether the German Federal Army will be deployed in other countries is significantly undermined .
<en> The Reform Treaty allows for the formation of a military core Europe via ' permanent structured cooperation ' .
<en> This creates a primary legislation framework for increased deployment of EU battle groups ( Article 28 , Protocol 4 ) .
<en> The European Court of Justice is explicitly not competent ( Article 11 , 240a ) .
<en> Nor is the European Parliament competent ; it is merely kept up to date ( Article 21 ) .
<en> This releases future military intervention from democratic control .
<en> This enabling of a militaristic Europe is accompanied by repressive partitioning off of the external borders .
<en> The new Article 62 of the Reform Treaty is designed to effect ' the gradual introduction of an integrated management system for external borders ' .
<en> Thanks to the undemocratic enforcement of the Lisbon Treaty by circumventing referendums , the codifying of neoliberal economic policies and the militaristic parts of the document , Europe is developing in completely the wrong direction .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) We have here a very good report , which seems to have said everything .
<en> We thank those who worked on it .
<en> Nevertheless , allow me a reformulation that is not a figure of speech .
<en> Our general goal , as politicians , is to arrange relationships between people in the society , so that we can all live as long as possible keeping harmony between us and nature .
<en> If we accept this goal , we have no demographic problem .
<en> In fact , we are subject to a demographic study only by an unjustified simplification and ignorance of what we are .
<en> There are other indicators measuring the situation of people , as population , and we know them .
<en> They are called human development indexes .
<en> From this point of view , the European Union countries are ranked at the top of the most advanced countries , which is good .
<en> The challenge is not to change the demographic behaviours , but to accept that we need to change our economic and social model .
<en> It is superior to other models , but inadequate .
<en> It lagged behind our own development as people .
<en> There is a gap between our general goal and the organization of the social environment and the economic relations , between declaration and facts .
<en> We say it is necessary to have more children born .
<en> In the meantime , 30 % of Europe 's children live below the poverty threshold .
<en> We ask women to give birth to children , but single mothers experience the biggest risk of exclusion .
<en> The employment rate has to increase , but social services should not be financed .
<en> We export problems and we want to import solutions , but citizens are not a market .
<en> We have to humanize the economic and social relations if we want to solve this problem .
<en> This is the big challenge .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) Mr President , I am addressing you now on behalf of a region in demographic crisis and one of the sickest nations in that region .
<en> As a Member responsible for public health , I cannot emphasise strongly enough how closely our demographic problems are linked to public health problems .
<en> In my homeland , Hungary , more people die from cancer than anywhere else in Europe , and this too is contributing to the fact that each year 50 % more people die than are born .
<en> The Castex report on the demographic future of Europe rightly points out that a new policy must be drawn up in the interests of renewal .
<en> Allow me to give just one example : whilst the population of Islamic countries will grow to 1 300 million by 2050 , Europe will fall from 495 to 400 million .
<en> This new demographic policy must be built on two bases : the family , as the most important basic unit of society , and healthy people .
<en> Families must be guaranteed a system that encourages them effectively , and protection .
<en> Today , in many Member States , having children is equal to having poverty .
<en> But there are many good examples too .
<en> There are some countries where the state takes the additional burden from the shoulders of large families .
<en> This good example must be implemented everywhere .
<en> Health is a condition for quality of life .
<en> Citizens must be made interested in preserving their own state of health .
<en> They will obtain the state support necessary for this in every material area , such as compulsory screening tests and free sports opportunities , and all along intellectual lines , that is , with education in health and demographic knowledge .
<en> It is in the fundamental interests of every Member State to improve its demographic and health situation .
<en> This is particularly important in Hungary , where the population might fall below 10 million in future , and where the average life expectancy is ten years lower than the European average .
<en> The future of Europe depends on the demographic performance of the generations living now .
<en> What a government fails to do today with a bad policy will be difficult to rectify later .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen , people in the European Union are living longer and longer .
<en> That is a positive phenomenon .
<en> On the other hand , there is a steady decrease in the number of young people .
<en> The number of people in the productive age group will start to fall within no more than three or four years .
<en> Today the ratio is three people of working age to one person of pension age ; it will be just one and a half people of working age in 2050 .
<en> How do we solve the economic effects of the ageing of the population ?
<en> Firstly : we must find jobs for more people .
<en> The traditional policy of men working and women carrying out family duties is not creditable any more .
<en> Most women wish both to become mothers and to have a professional career .
<en> Public policies must back both wishes .
<en> The Scandinavian countries are a good example .
<en> Their active labour market policies combined with better care for women with children offer the best quality of life .
<en> Secondly , we must reform the social welfare systems designed to care for older people and for people who have reached pension age .
<en> If we do not do this on the grounds of social equality and solidarity , the losers will be mostly older people .
<en> In order to achieve a long-term improvement , we need reforms of pension systems and medical care systems , and investment in good health .
<en> Older people have accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience and we need to motivate them to continue to work for longer in their lives .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , the Lisbon Strategy is beginning a new cycle , giving us an opportunity to introduce reforms that will increase productivity at work and help to create jobs , thus helping to reduce the economic impact of population ageing .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Ladies and gentlemen , at present , Europe is dealing with substantial demographic challenges that will have a long-term impact on its future .
<en> Therefore , today 's debate is not only welcomed , but also necessary for ensuring a good future and sustainable development .
<en> Of all the report 's recommendations , I consider that 3 ideas should constitute the core of the European demographic policy .
<en> In the context of the population aging trend , the European Union should first of all pay particular attention to children and young people .
<en> Child protection and providing a solid opportunity for personal and professional evolution for young people are strategically important for the future , and the development of these objectives should be integrated into a comprehensive policy of family protection and women 's promotion .
<en> The second element , education , is in close correlation with the above-mentioned principle .
<en> A competitive Europe involves human resources able to face the new challenges , as well as scientific progress , public health and an adequate living standard .
<en> The achievement of these objectives unquestionably depends on the level of education and lifelong training of all the generations .
<en> Finally , migration inflows represent the third decisive factor since immigration is an important premise for ensuring demographic equilibrium and economic growth .
<en> Therefore , I welcome the Rapporteur 's call to consider immigration a positive element of the European population , but , especially , to consolidate the European policies in the field of social integration of immigrants , and the fight against discrimination and xenophobia .
<en> In conclusion , I would like to emphasize the need to mobilize public policies at all the necessary levels in order to successfully implement the mentioned objectives .
<en> Local and regional authorities have a decisive role in this direction and they should be constantly involved .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) Congratulations to the rapporteur on having prepared such an excellent document .
<en> I would like to point out that both our success and our failure in implementing it will be of huge importance for the future of the European Union .
<en> There is a possibility that several smaller EU nations could find themselves on the brink of extinction in 100 years ' time .
<en> The aging population reflects an increase in quality of life and social solidarity as well as the devaluation of the family .
<en> It could hinder the progress of Europe but , with the relevant precautions in place , new possibilities may arise .
<en> The countries that joined the EU in the new millennium in particular are feeling the burden of these problems very acutely .
<en> Their citizens are plagued by pitiful pensions , birth rates lower than the EU average , alcohol and drug abuse ...
<en> This area benefited from a sufficient number of crèches and infant schools before the transition to the market economy , when most of them were closed down .
<en> There is mass emigration from the new accession countries , especially the Baltic countries , Poland , Bulgaria and Romania , to the richer Member States .
<en> This represents an immense loss of hard-working hands and educated minds , people who were educated in their countries at great cost .
<en> I support the proposal to allocate structural funds to compensate for this damage , but it is not enough .
<en> There should be additional financial support for new accession countries , which are most unfortunately suffering from ' brain drain ' , as they have lost their best scientists , doctors , engineers and artists to the richer Member States .
<en> I support the proposal to enable older people to work part-time , as they would then be able to pass on their experience to the younger generation .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , Written Declaration No 88 / 2007 on investigating the abuse of power by large supermarkets was signed by 439 Members and officially adopted by the European Parliament .
<en> In May 2007 the Polish Parliament passed an act on the creation and operation of supermarkets that meets the demands expressed in the Declaration .
<en> In particular , the act requires local authorities on whose territory supermarkets are to be located to ensure that a balance is maintained between the various forms of trade and that the principle of fair competition in the pursuit of commercial activities is respected .
<en> The European Commission has called these measures into question and is demanding that the Polish Government change them or face referral of the matter to the Court of Justice .
<en> I would like you , Madam President , to draw the European Commission 's attention to the flagrant contradiction between Parliament 's expectations and the Commission 's action in this matter .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , the presidential election took place a week ago in Russia , and the result was as disappointing as we might have expected .
<en> Dmitry Medvedev won , and the losers were democracy and human rights .
<en> Three days before the election , I had a meeting with representatives of human-rights organisations in Moscow .
<en> They reported flagrant obstruction of the opposition during the electoral campaign and harassment of independent journalists and human-rights activists .
<en> Moreover , suspicions of electoral fraud cannot be dispelled .
<en> The EU should now send a very clear signal that it does not accept this conduct .
<en> Relations between the EU and Russia should be placed on a more honest footing .
<en> The same applies to relations with China , particularly as today is 10 March , the date on which , in 1959 , the popular uprising in Tibet against the country 's occupation by the People 's Republic of China was brutally crushed .
<sp>
<en> - ( EL ) Madam President , a short while ago we heard the discussion on Palestine .
<en> The humanitarian situation in Gaza is worse than it has been since 1967 .
<en> Currently 80 % of the population , in other words about 1.1 million people , are dependent on food aid compared with 63 % in 2006 .
<en> Unemployment has reached 40 % , according to a report by Amnesty International .
<en> We saw what happened in the area last weekend : murders were committed on both sides ; there were hostilities , while the Palestinian people awaited a better tomorrow that is slow in coming .
<en> It is therefore time for the EU to assume its responsibilities and implement a policy based on objective criteria rather than dictated by Big Brother America .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Yesterday was a day of homage in Bulgaria .
<en> March 9 is the date on which Turkish terrorists blasted the carriage for mothers with children on the Sofia - Burgas train 23 years ago .
<en> Seven people died , out of whom two were children .
<en> Another nine were badly injured .
<en> Today , one of the persons convicted for participation in the preparation of that atrocious crime , Sabri Mehmedali , is a party functionary of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms .
<en> For almost two decades , this Movement , an ethnic partry existing in violation of the Bulgarian Constitution , has been using the central and local government levers , not only tolerating but also encouraging the dissemination of Islamic fundamentalism .
<en> The MRF is the only party in Europe that has erected a monument to proven terrorists who killed children .
<en> Less than two weeks ago , nine people were burnt alive in the sleeping car on the Sofia - Kardam train .
<en> There is serious evidence pointing to arson committed on the eve of the national day of 3 March .
<en> Last year , on that memorable date , Turks harassed sexually Bulgarian young people in the country called Bulgaria .
<en> The sense of impunity that the government has inspiured in the MRF instigates violence among the Turks .
<en> ( The chairperson interrupts the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) May I draw the House 's attention to next Thursday , 13 March , which is World Kidney Day .
<en> As you are know , chronic kidney disease is something of a silent epidemic in Europe , because its progression is often asymptomatic .
<en> Most people are not familiar with the disease and it is not seen as a priority by policy-makers .
<en> It is thought to affect 8 % of Europeans , a figure that is set to double over the coming decade unless something is done about it .
<en> Last week the European Kidney Health Alliance and World Kidney Day held a symposium on the subject , with an accompanying exhibition , and I myself have set up an MEP group along with a number of colleagues .
<en> I urge all members of the House to support this initiative , because I am convinced that the European Parliament can play a leading role in encouraging Member States to act promptly to get the scale of the problem recognised and an appropriate strategy devised .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office . - ( SL ) I would like to thank you all for a very interesting debate .
<en> In my opinion the report was also of very high quality and full of good ideas .
<en> I would like to say that in many issues in this debate Parliament and the Council expressed very similar opinions , which are too numerous to list here .
<en> I am convinced that this similarity will give these opinions additional weight and that it offers a good basis for future cooperation between the two institutions .
<en> I am also sure that it will be reflected in the conclusions that ministers are to debate and adopt next week .
<en> I am convinced that both institutions will closely study the legislative proposals which the Commission is to present at the informal session in Slovenia in May , and that we will have an interesting debate at that session .
<en> Finally , I would like to say that the Slovenian Presidency will strive for a speedy start to the debate on these proposals in order to finish most of the work during the Slovenian Presidency .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I completely agree with Mr Nicholson that this is the first step in a discussion that is going to continue for almost the rest of this year and , therefore , I shall not go into detail on all the various questions that have been raised here today .
<en> I shall just pinpoint a few of the more important ones .
<en> First of all , a huge majority is in favour of the idea of more decoupling , and I am very appreciative of this idea .
<en> The idea of giving a Member State the possibility to introduce a regional model is a chance for them to go further towards a flat rate and I have explained on various occasions why I think this is important .
<en> In order not to raise any expectations , I will be very direct and very frank on tobacco decoupling .
<en> It was decided in the reform of 2004 to decouple tobacco payments .
<en> As we are now trying to go even further in decoupling , the idea that some of you raised of extending the coupled payment for tobacco would be a step in totally the wrong direction .
<en> Therefore , do not have any expectations that the Commission will move in that direction .
<en> Ms McGuinness said that modulation was like robbing farmers .
<en> I do not agree with this approach .
<en> I think the rural development policy will need more money in order to meet the new challenges - climate change and the reduction of CO2 emissions will be the most important ones .
<en> We have to take into account , firstly , that the decoupled money will stay in the Member States and , secondly , that modulated money is co-financed by Member States and therefore you actually steer the money .
<en> You get twice as much as you deduct from the direct payment .
<en> This is an important message and we will come back to this in the legislative proposals .
<en> Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned progressive modulation and the necessity , from his point of view , to include labour intensity in these discussions .
<en> I understand his point of view , but I can only say that this will be extremely bureaucratic and very , very difficult to manage , so I am very reluctant to enter into this discussion .
<en> I might be wrong , but , personally , I do not consider the introduction of codecision on agriculture a threat , as I heard suggested .
<en> I consider this a huge and natural step in a situation where the agricultural sector is so important , both from an economic point of view and because this is important for quite a lot of people .
<en> Therefore , I welcome this change , but , on the other hand , it is important that we finalise this health check before the end of the year , otherwise it will be a Health Check for 2010 and then we are too close to 2013 .
<en> That is the reason why , but , believe me , I am very happy with the changes that have been mentioned .
<en> Concerning developing countries , the European Union is the most open market for developing countries : we import more agricultural products than Canada , the United States , Australia and Japan put together .
<en> This has to be taken into account when we talk about the agricultural sector .
<en> I should like to say to Ms Harkin that I have been informed that she has tabled an oral question .
<en> This will be answered in writing and , therefore , I am quite sure she will get all the information she has been asking for .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , with this discussion the sport of figure skating comes to mind .
<en> When judging figure skating , we discard the highest and lowest marks and then award the score .
<en> If I therefore remove the far right and far left views in this House , we shall then have a result with which we are all very satisfied and with which we can all live very happily .
<en> Thank you very much for your support and cooperation .
<en> I would emphasise this once again beyond the limits of the groups .
<en> I am looking forward to what will be exciting cooperation on the legislative package .
<sp>
<en> I would only add , Mr Goepel , that the same principle of trimming off the highest and lowest marks also applies in ski-jumping and boxing .
<en> If this enlarges our debate , then all well and good .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Wednesday 12 March 2008 .
<en> Written declarations ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Of course it is of the utmost importance to clearly stress in the framework of this report the necessity to maintain direct payments not only in the case of climate-related crisis or market failures but also to balance fairly the high European standards in terms of environmental , animal and consumer protection .
<en> Nevertheless , it is our duty to consider seriously the situation of the least-developed agricultural producing countries while reviewing the criteria under which direct payments will be made in the future under our common agricultural policy .
<en> Moreover , we have to acknowledge the difficult situation faced by most of the new Member States ' agricultural sectors requiring specific attention and further investments mainly in restructuring and modernisation of the sector .
<en> Finally , I would like to point out that it is essential while addressing the CAP health check that the emphasis should - following the recent crises - be on guaranteeing food safety and supply for our citizens by ensuring sufficient food-stocks .
<chp>

<en> The next item is Question Time ( B6-0013 / 2008 ) .
<en> I am sorry for those colleagues who have been waiting for this to start and , clearly , we will have to look at why we are so late in starting today .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , on a point of order , according to the parliamentary website Oral Questions , my question was No 3 on the list .
<en> The question was designed to be answered by Commissioner Mandelson , as its title clearly stated ' WTO talks ' and Mr Mandelson is conducting those talks on our behalf .
<en> However , I now see that my question has been put into section 3 , which means that it will not be verbally answered by Commissioner Mandelson .
<en> I am asking whether he is refusing to be accountable to the House for the WTO negotiations .
<en> What is the point in tabling a question to a Commissioner who is present on the day if the Commissioner refuses to answer that question ?
<sp>
<en> It is the Commission that decides who answers which questions .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , that is the problem , because the question , on WTO talks , was clearly for Commissioner Mandelson .
<en> He is the Commissioner who was conducting those talks , he is here today and he is refusing to answer the question .
<sp>
<en> Ms Harkin , your point is noted and we will do what we can .
<en> The following questions are addressed to the Commission .
<en> Part one
<en> Subject : Negative impact on business of the international credit crisis
<en> The current international credit crisis , which is leading the US economy into recession , is slowing down the rate of growth at world level .
<en> The effects on the European economy and business are substantial .
<en> Greek and other European companies are already coming under considerable pressure from the increase in imports from non-EU countries whose cheaper products are constantly gaining ground on the market .
<en> At the same time , a fall in European exports is forecast for the current year .
<en> What measures will the Commission take to provide European companies with effective support to survive this crisis and become more commercially competitive at international level ?
<en> Which sectors of commerce and which European products does it consider to be most vulnerable ?
<en> Which should be protected as a matter of priority and how can that be achieved ?
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I naturally wish to thank all the speakers for an extremely enriching and interesting debate .
<en> I am not the Commissioner responsible for this issue .
<en> I will not deny , however , that I was extremely encouraged and interested in this debate .
<en> Many personal ideas have come to mind , and that is undeniable proof that you have captured my interest on a subject that is obviously extremely important .
<en> In order to overcome the obstacles to the reintegration of female prisoners into society and the job market , we must obviously again stress the need to combine implementing measures and an adapted safety net .
<en> This will require the involvement of all interested parties , including the social partners .
<en> The Commission intends to continue examining social inclusion issues with the Member States in accordance with the open method of coordination .
<en> Indeed , many of the proposals tabled here - which , of course , I will pass on to Commissioner Špidla - have attracted my attention .
<en> For instance , the idea that already exists in several countries of trying , where possible , to find alternative sentences - when the person in prison does not represent any danger to society - is certainly a very interesting approach .
<en> I am also thinking , although here I am speaking freely , about the use of electronic tags that allow people to leave prison and live with their families .
<en> There are many elements to be examined in relation to this issue , for what I have heard here is quite right too : imprisonment is above all an act of social reconciliation , of course , and so efforts must also be made to make this act of reintegration into society a positive element .
<en> I was also very interested in the comments made by Mrs Záborská - which were echoed in different ways by a number of speakers - on the whole issue of family ties and ties to children , which , of course , require some extremely specific approaches .
<en> Hygiene in prisons , health care , sexual preferences , sexual abuse and sexual violence are also subjects I am familiar with , of course , through my work as Commissioner for Development , even if I am not responsible for this particular issue .
<en> Naturally I regularly visit prisons in developing countries .
<en> I can assure you , therefore , that I am certainly in a position to appreciate these matters .
<en> In any case , I will not fail to report back to Commissioner Špidla on this excellent debate and the excellent ideas I have heard here ; I know that he is extremely interested in these matters .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , thank you for staying up so late .
<2en> I would also like to thank Commissioners Michel and Špidla for their highly positive participation in the report we are presenting ; and I would like to thank you , ladies and gentlemen , and Mr Matsakis , who is the only male fellow Member to be taking part in this debate .
<2en> I believe that maintaining family ties is a common denominator , and everyone has stressed how important it is .
<2en> It is also vital to protect children , above all , small children , and establish appropriate conditions tailored to the special needs of women .
<2en> The primary issue , however , should be that we stand up for human rights , especially the rights of women , regardless of whether or not they are in prison .
<2en> Therefore , what applies to women who are not in prison ought also to apply to those who are .
<2en> With regard to social exclusion , let me give particular thanks to Commissioner Špidla , who through you , Commissioner Michel , stressed the importance of support measures as early as the detention stage : measures for vocational training , for integration into the market and for cooperation with the private sector .
<2en> We can thus put into practice what you have said , Commissioner : we should see to it that prison becomes an opportunity and not a form of revenge .
<2en> With regard to of Mr Matsakis 's point of view that there are also dangerous tendencies , these exist both inside and outside prison , and we must provide the opportunity and the medical means to tackle them , so that we can prevent the marginalisation of individuals .
<2en> Marginalisation is in conflict with our ideas about the dignity of individuals and the possibility of supporting them so that they can give of their best to society .
<2en> I hope , as the Commissioner has said , that the new Lisbon Treaty will give us the opportunity to take more action .
<2en> Since the presentation of this report and the ratification of the Treaty are not far removed , many of the suggestions made in the report may become a reality .
<2en> I shall return , however , to a subject not mentioned , namely that the Commission 's annual report on human rights should also include the condition of women in EU prisons .
<sp>
<en> Although Mr Matsakis was the only male Member speaking , Mr Michel spoke for the Commission , and I have listened with great attention to this interesting debate .
<en> As so often , the women out number the men in these late-night debates , but that does not diminish their contribution .
<en> I thank the rapporteur and others who have spoken for their words , because , after all , in a debate like this , you are speaking for women who cannot speak for themselves .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place on Thursday 13 March .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) I would like to draw attention to the fact that while women represent approximately 4-5 % of the prison population in Europe , and while the proportion of women in prisons in many European countries is growing at a faster rate than the male prison population , prisons themselves continue to be designed primarily for men and tend to ignore the particular problems of the growing female prison population .
<en> The areas that give greatest cause for concern are healthcare , the situation of mothers with children , and professional and social reintegration .
<en> Statistics on female prisoners suggest a generally low level of education and a lack of vocational skills .
<en> If we want female prisoners to be able to reintegrate into society and have a more stable life following their time in prison , we need to provide all prisoners with opportunities to acquire basic educational skills .
<en> In many European prisons , a difference can be observed between the vocational training offered to women and the demands of the labour market .
<en> Most prisons offer feminised vocational training that is limited to developing the skills and abilities relating to the cultural and social roles traditionally attributed to women .
<en> The labour market does not generally value these low-paid vocational skills highly , and this may favour the perpetuation of social inequalities and undermine social and professional reintegration .
<en> Prison authorities should therefore be encouraged to offer , perhaps in cooperation with external providers , high-quality vocational training measures and varied employment opportunities that are in line with labour market requirements and free from gender stereotypes .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I congratulate my colleague Ms Uca on this excellent report and I welcome the two-track approach , endorsed by the Commission in its communication , focusing on both gender mainstreaming and specific actions to empower women .
<en> I deplore , however , that many DCI country strategy papers merely refer to gender as a cross-cutting issue , failing to specify concrete activities , targets or financial allocations .
<en> This means that , despite the strategic framework , gender efforts in development cooperation could be reduced to rhetoric in the years to come .
<en> Gender-sensitive performance indicators should be assessed in mid-term and final reviews .
<en> Parliament will monitor the implementation of the CPS , and we hope that the Commission will be able to indicate progress in terms of specific gender-related outcomes .
<en> Finally , I am shocked by several medieval conceptions reflected in some amendments to this report put forward by some colleagues on sexual and reproductive health matters .
<en> I will vote against them , evidently .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I too want to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report and also congratulate the Commission on its communication .
<en> The challenge now is to be consistent .
<en> Ten days ago I went to New York , together with several colleagues from national parliaments , to visit the Commission on the Status of Women , at the invitation of the European Parliamentary Forum .
<en> It is interesting to find that countries that are our ACP partners say one thing when they are talking to Brussels and the various capitals and then say something quite different in New York , when it comes to discussing the matter at global level .
<en> That is why I call on the Commissioner to be consistent , to advise his delegations that there is also talk in the respective capitals about the attitude taken in New York , because our goals in regard to women 's policy and development policy are often contradicted in New York .
<en> In that connection , I am very glad that UNIFEM is now opening an office in Brussels ; that will certainly raise the level of the debate between the United Nations and the European Union in this area .
<en> I am particularly glad that micro-credits are being named as one means of empowerment , of liberating women .
<en> There are some relatively obscure arrangements ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker . )
<sp>
<en> ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my many thanks go to Mrs Uca for an excellent report , and at the same time I share the disapproval expressed my many of the Members here regarding the amendments tabled by the Right .
<en> For women 's rights to be fully implemented in development cooperation as well , the European Union needs an envoy for women 's rights , whose role would be to ensure that women 's rights were taken into account .
<en> That way it would also be possible to spend development cooperation money more effectively .
<en> We know that the cheapest way of promoting development is to improve women 's rights , including their sexual rights , education , opportunities for employment and so on .
<en> Although people know this from experience and numerous reports , it gets forgotten time after time , even when they are deciding on how to spend EU development cooperation cash .
<en> That is why we need an envoy for women 's rights , and that is why I hope that everyone here will show their support for Amendment 20 on this issue .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , although there is much good in this report , there is something I totally disagree with , as my colleagues , Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Mitchell have already done .
<en> I start by asking you , Mr President , who said this : ' Through the practice of prenatal sex selection , countless women are denied the right even to exist . '
<en> It might surprise the rapporteur of this report to know that it was said by Ban Ki-moon in his opening address to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women , in New York .
<en> Furthermore , according to the UNFPA , in its state of the world population report last year , there is a global deficit of 60 million women in the world - that is the whole population of the United Kingdom !
<en> These missing females have been prenatally sex-selected , aborted and ' infanticised ' out of existence , and this is happening on the continent on which I was born ; I know what I am talking about .
<en> How is it that a report of the European Parliament on gender equality can be silent on the deliberate elimination on the basis of gender alone ?
<en> Where is the equality in that ?
<en> I tabled an amendment to this report demanding a gender analysis of all abortions performed in the world , and guess what happened ?
<en> The Socialists voted against it !
<en> Why ?
<en> Do we not have the right to know how women are being aborted before they are born ?
<en> We will see later today how they vote on Amendment 11 .
<en> I do not know why the rapporteur has insisted on squandering this valuable opportunity to remove the most significant cause of injustice against women in the world today - their basic right to life - and , instead , insist on perpetuating through championing the so-called rights of sexual ...
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker . )
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the statistics prove that equal rights policy hastens achievement of the Millennium Development Goals for eradicating poverty and correcting demographic , social and economic indicators .
<en> Gender issues , however , are still considered of secondary importance .
<en> In many countries women continue to lack access to basic health services , education and participation in decision-making processes .
<en> Two thirds of all the world 's illiterates are women .
<en> In the developing countries the likelihood of attending secondary school is 11 % less for girls than for boys .
<en> The statistics also show a tragic health situation .
<en> In sub-Saharan Africa , for example , 60 % of those infected by the HIV virus are women , and girls account for 75 % of new cases of AIDS among young people .
<en> The Commission 's Communication is an important step towards the EU 's introduction of gender issues into the programme of cooperation with partner countries as a major instrument in the eradication of poverty and support for human rights , which includes combating violence against women .
<en> I congratulate the rapporteur on a very well prepared report , and in conclusion ...

<en> ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , today 's debate gives me great satisfaction .
<en> Despite all attempts and initiatives on the part of European bodies , I believe we are acting as though we have abandoned to its fate a people ensnared in successive political crises .
<en> Our treatment of the situation is awkward .
<en> We seem not to realise that the situation in Lebanon is connected with the challenges in the Middle East and that these challenges are crucial for international security and peace as well as for the EU 's strategic plans in the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
<en> I believe that the European Parliament should be made to understand clearly that we in the EU must adhere to the commitments made in our partnership with Lebanon .
<en> This obliges us to support the legally elected government , which was formed after the last elections in accordance with constitutional requirements , and which today is the target of attacks and threats .
<en> We must demonstrate our support through deeds .
<en> As Mrs Napoletano has also said , we are not giving enough money , because we are keen on an outcome that resolves the crisis and ends insecurity .
<en> Such an outcome requires institutions to function .
<en> Parliament has to work as a forum for democratic dialogue and state control ; it has to voice the diversity that is an essential part of Lebanon 's identity .
<en> A certain parliament is still closed , not just for the election of the President of the Republic , but for all business .
<en> If any way is to be found out of the crisis , the President of the Republic needs to be elected immediately and a new government must be formed in accordance with the Constitution .
<en> Regional forces competing with each other ought not call the tune , as currently seems to be the case in the presidential election .
<en> We must also demonstrate our support for the Lebanese seeking the truth behind political murders .
<en> Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets , waving ' We Want The Truth ' banners .
<en> We in the EU must act more effectively and strategically in the region .
<en> We must promote responsibilities and genuine interests .
<en> We must also find possible resolutions and peace in the states in the area and in the Arab states .
<en> There must be understanding and national dialogue .
<en> Let me end on an optimistic note .
<en> I believe that the political powers have acted responsibly : events could have led to civil war and a coup , but this did not happen .
<en> Let us therefore make the most of these positive elements .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as chairwoman of the delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries , I am pleased we have a debate on Lebanon on the agenda for this afternoon .
<en> The crisis that this country has been experiencing for several months obviously goes beyond the challenges of a simple presidential election or the formation of a government .
<en> We know that it is the very foundations of the political system that are in question , based as they are on the subtle balance between the different religious faiths in the Lebanese patchwork .
<en> What is also in question is the place Lebanon hopes to take in the regional arena .
<en> Does it want to be an aircraft carrier of the United States and their allies in the region , or the advanced post of a so-called Shi 'ite crescent ?
<en> I do not believe that Lebanon really has to choose between the American camp and the Syrian / Iranian camp .
<en> The only viable camp for Lebanon is the camp of Lebanon itself .
<en> It is certainly not for the European Union to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs .
<en> Europe does not have to support one coalition over another .
<en> What the European Union can do is offer itself as a mediator , help the Lebanese parties to find a minimum of trust in each other - which is essential before any agreement can be reached - and put forward its good offices to launch a process of understanding and compromise .
<en> We are right to support the Arab League 's plan based on a triple consensus : one president , one government of national union and the reform of the electoral law guaranteeing fair representation of all the components of Lebanese society .
<en> That is the condition sine qua non for the political secularisation that is provided for in the Taif Agreements and that a growing majority of the Lebanese people want to happen .
<en> We must support every initiative to achieve this .
<en> In this regard , the proposal by Nabih Berri , speaker of the Lebanese parliament , which proposes to revive national dialogue , is a positive signal .
<en> Just as we have done for many years , we must continue to support a Lebanon that wants to be sovereign , united and at peace with itself at last .
<sp>
<en> - ( ES ) Mr President , I have the impression that one of the few times that Lebanese members of parliament elected in 2005 have been able to act freely was recently , at the plenary sitting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Athens , because being a Lebanese member of parliament is certainly very dangerous , as events have tragically demonstrated .
<en> I think that there are some who want us to believe that there is no solution for Lebanon , and therefore that Lebanon is not viable as an independent , sovereign and democratic State .
<en> We need to fight against this by supporting the Lebanese institutions , supporting the Arab League 's plan and demanding the removal of any obstacles that are being placed in the way of peace and understanding coming to that country .
<en> Europe has not washed its hands of Lebanon ; I would like to remind everyone here of the European military presence in UNIFIL 2 , which is an impressive number , and there have been many casualties and deaths , as the Council has reminded us .
<en> Our political presence is equal to this military presence .
<en> We have limitations , but within those limitations on our capacity , we need to ask the powers outside the region and the Lebanese to reach an agreement , as without them it will be impossible for there to be socio-economic development for the good of the people or peace in the Middle East .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the recent Arab summit was more soap than substance .
<en> It failed to resolve the important questions due to the absence of key players .
<en> Lebanon 's political crisis and ever-worsening security situation means that the EU must improve the political dialogue and assist a return to the rule of law and democracy .
<en> Despite the EU-Lebanon Action Plan having identified effective implementation of Lebanon 's international commitments with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms as a priority , almost no progress has been made .
<en> Dysfunctional state institutions and the worsening economy have caused civil disquiet and protests .
<en> Even the recent teachers ' strike is toothless without responsive state institutions .
<en> The current political situation undermines the European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) reform agenda , but the ENP can be a catalyst for political debate by moving it from power-based discussions towards issue-based discussions .
<en> ENP partnership rewards progress .
<en> Lebanon is not the best student at learning and cooperating with the ENP , but we cannot allow its adoption as if it were a strategy choice .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) As a member of the Euromed / Barcelona Process delegation , I monitor the issue of Lebanon and I regret to say that although Lebanon has a majority parliament , a legitimate majority , this majority is being intimidated and the parliament does not meet at all .
<en> Since the murder of Rafik Hariri , who was well-known and respected , there has not yet been a presidential election and the country as a whole is incapable of finding a political solution to this complicated situation .
<en> Members of the Lebanese Parliament whom I met recently , both at the latest Euromed meeting in Athens and here in Brussels , told us how terrible conditions for them are .
<en> The feeling in Lebanon is that in practical terms Syria has political power over the country , specifically over southern Lebanon where Hezbollah puts the area in danger on a daily basis by firing rockets into northern Israel .
<en> Iran supports the situation and I do not think that this axis is willing to accept democratic changes .
<en> I would like to appeal to my colleagues and to all those present , in both the Council and this Parliament , to adopt measures to provide immediate assistance to Lebanon .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , one positive outcome of the latest enlargement of the Schengen area has been the elimination of controls at internal EU borders .
<en> Poland has of course removed all control points and consequently in my province alone we have shut down as many as 55 border crossings .
<en> Their closure has , however , presented the local authorities with a need to manage the remaining infrastructure .
<en> This comprises a number of buildings , towers , hangars , warehouses and parking areas along with adjacent land , excellently positioned , often beside important international communication routes .
<en> The local government districts in which these facilities are located are interested in managing them , but they do not have the funds to do so .
<en> There is consequently a high degree of likelihood that all these facilities will be used for commercial purposes .
<en> I am therefore appealing to the European Commission to set up a special fund that will help districts in border areas to manage this infrastructure for public utility purposes , including trans-border purposes , thus promoting cultural integration .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I would like to take this opportunity to express my respect for the brave mountain people of Tibet who are fighting for national independence .
<en> What I have to say is not a demonstration against the Chinese .
<en> On the contrary .
<en> I have respect for the Chinese people , who also fought for national freedom against the Japanese occupation , and for freedom and civil liberties inside China itself - an example of this being the Boxer Rebellion in the 19th century .
<en> This is all the more reason why the Chinese , with this tradition in mind , should not refuse the people of Tibet the right to self-determination .
<en> As Members of the European Parliament we must make our solidarity with Tibet evident , not only in words , but also through deeds .
<en> European politicians should not lend credibility to the Beijing Games by attending them .
<en> We should stay away from Beijing at this time .
<en> I say this as a keen fan and observer of the Athens Olympics .
<en> For our part this is the least we can do .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement .
<en> Some find much to celebrate ; I do not .
<en> Why ?
<en> Because it is the Belfast Agreement which rewarded 30 years of terrorism in Northern Ireland by undermining both justice and democracy : justice , by granting an early-release amnesty to all duly convicted terrorist prisoners ; and democracy , by prescribing that unrepentant terrorists must be included in the government of the region they ravaged for decades .
<en> That is to be achieved by the iniquity of mandatory coalition .
<en> The region which I represent is the only region in all of the European Union where citizens are denied the fundamental , democratic right to vote a party out of office .
<en> Why ?
<en> Because the Belfast Agreement by law stipulates that all parties must be in government if there is to be a government .
<en> That is the Belfast Agreement and that is wrong .
<en> It is something to be denounced , not celebrated .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Mr. President , distinguished colleagues , one of the greatest challenges faced by my country , Bulgaria , during the first years of its membership in the Community has been to ensure transparency and prevent any misuse of resources absorbed from the European funds .
<en> In support of anticorruption efforts , I have initiated the establishment of a Public Council for citizens ' monitoring of the absorption of EU funds in Bulgarian agriculture .
<en> This will not be a formal institution but a civil society formation to pool the efforts of all who want to make sure that this opportunity to boost Bulgaria 's development would not be squandered away due to corruption , misuse and mismanagement .
<en> The great goal is to set up mechanisms for public control and general access to information on how funds are spent in agriculture , information on project implementation and dissemination of best practices in the sector .
<en> Let us remember that promoting active citizen involvement in socio-political processes is a key priority on the Community 's agenda .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) More than one year after Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU and almost nine years after the beginning of the Bologna process , eight European countries do not acknowledge the university degrees and other qualifications obtained in these two Member States .
<en> Many times , Romanian citizens are discriminated when they wish to become employed or continue their education abroad .
<en> The non-recognition of diplomas also contributes to low participation in European student mobility programmes , especially as regards postgraduate diplomas .
<en> For instance , a Romanian student could not participate in a master degree programme financed by Erasmus-Mundus in a university centre from any of the eight Member States that will not acknowledge the student 's basic university degree .
<en> This is discrimination against the citizens of a Member State and its result is the limitation of their chances to obtain European funds for academic mobility .
<en> The European Commission has recently condemned this conduct .
<en> I believe the European Parliament should have the same firm attitude in this respect .

<en> ( PL ) Mr President , 2009 will bring many changes and challenges for the European Parliament .
<en> Not only will elections be held and a new parliamentary term begin , but also , most importantly , the challenges relating to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty will have to be dealt with .
<en> Life does not stand still , and I am not referring exclusively to political life .
<en> There comes a time when changes are needed , along with new plans and approaches to action .
<en> Generally speaking , greater financial input is required for changes to be effective .
<en> Nonetheless , the budgetary resources should be administered more efficiently and any unnecessary bureaucracy eliminated .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Paul Rübig , because Eurostars is , in my view , an important initiative of the European Commission to support research and development performing SMEs .
<en> In spite of the fact that SMEs account for almost 70 % of the EU 's GDP , their potential in the area of research and development has not yet been sufficiently exploited .
<en> I would like to underscore the rapporteur 's effort to enable the highest possible number of SMEs to participate in this programme .
<en> According to the original proposal , many SMEs would be excluded from the process since they would have to contribute at least 50 % towards the cost of the projects .
<en> Following the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council , SMEs will be able to participate in , and collaborate on , proposals for projects in the field of research and development .
<en> I am pleased that Slovakia is among the 29 participating countries that have already expressed support for this programme .
<en> It is paramount that Slovak SME entrepreneurs receive information on how to access funding for research and development under this programme , and that the research potential grows in Slovakia and in other underdeveloped regions of Europe .
<en> The European research and innovation database , in which the Commission will publish the results of the projects carried out under this programme , will be a useful point of reference for SMEs .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall not speak for a second more , maybe for a second less .
<en> I merely want to say that it was an honour for me to vote in favour of the report by my friend Paul Rübig , outlining this proposal for a decision aimed at supporting SMEs .
<en> What I should like , above all else - and this gives me many sleepless nights - is for there to be projects taking into account the experience , capacities and memories of older people , who can teach younger people a great deal in SMEs and so benefit all of the EU countries and the European Union itself .
<en> Mr President , as you see I still have five seconds left to wish ' buon appetito ' to all of my colleagues who have been kind enough to stay behind to listen to my statement .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , any initiatives aimed at supporting and stimulating coal extraction and steel production deserve the European Parliament 's support .
<en> The aforementioned activities are particularly important , because no rapidly developing economy can prosper without these sectors of production .
<en> It is also worth bearing in mind that the largest producers of these raw materials are located outside the European Union and that in comparison , the position of the Member States is very poor indeed .
<en> There can be no doubt that the demand for coal and steel will continue to rise , driven by the rapidly developing Asian economies .
<en> Despite the need to progressively replace coal with renewable and more environmentally-friendly fuels , coal will remain a key source of energy and wealth for many regions of the European Union long into the future .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I voted for Amendment 3 , tabled by Mr Szymański , which is a stronger form of our general attitude to avoiding the presence of high-level state leaders at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics .
<en> Mr Szymański finds a connection between the presence of state leaders and possibly supporting the internal policies of the Chinese authorities .
<en> I think it might be a warning signal to the Chinese authorities to make this connection more clear .
<en> That is why I voted for Amendment 3 .

<en> ( ES ) Mr President , piracy has now become one of the worldwide threats to maritime safety .
<en> According to statistics compiled by the International Maritime Bureau , pirate attacks have tripled over the last decade : whereas there were 90 incidents of piracy in 1995 , in 2007 the figure had risen to 263 .
<en> As we speak , 26 crew members of the fishing vessel Playa de Bakio have been seized off Somalia and perhaps , as my fellow Member said earlier in this House , we should not only show solidarity with their families , but also request the European Union to take action in this matter and to make every effort to free these fishermen .
<en> It is not enough for us to sign agreements with various African States .
<en> We also have to ensure the safety of these vessels .
<en> The problem is European in scope and must be tackled as such .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , as you are aware , there will be a referendum in Ireland on 12 June on the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> I want to raise with you a matter of very deep concern in Ireland .
<en> It has emerged through the media that the Commission , and committees of this Parliament , are actively colluding to suppress information .
<en> Let me quote Commission Vice-President Margot Wallström , that the Commission is willing to tone down or delay messages that might be unhelpful in advance of the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty ; reports have been carried in the press of a letter that was sent to parliamentary committees urging them not to deal with sensitive political issues that might arise from Lisbon until the Treaty has been ratified .
<en> I want to say to you that these types of tactics are unacceptable .
<en> The Irish people should have their debate with full information .
<en> They deserve the full and unvarnished facts , whether in relation to corporation tax or the outworkings of the defence and security provisions of the Treaty .
<en> As a minimum - I am sure you will agree - the people deserve the full facts .
<en> So I call on you today to clarify publicly that committees will not delay or suppress debate on these sensitive matters , and I would equally urge the Commission to do likewise .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I apologise for the delay , but I have just arrived in Parliament .
<en> I believe that it would be unrealistic for anyone to talk about cross-border cooperation in the case of Greece , which is the country that receives the fourth highest number of illegal immigrants , after Spain , France and Sweden .
<en> Now what talk can there be of cross-border cooperation when , on the other hand - is this not the case , Mr President ? - we have to deal with a country engaged in just that : Turkey , which is doing that job ; in other words , Turkey has men who are professionally engaged in transporting illegal immigrants from Asia to Europe .
<en> In addition , the financial assistance received by Greece is minimal - I am sorry that I do not have enough time to go into the relevant details - and I must tell you that if Europe does not help , I believe that it is Europe that will have to foot the bill for the people who today are pouring into Europe , via Greece and the Aegean sea , with its 2 000 islands .

<en> ( BG ) I take the floor in order to draw your attention to a canker affecting the rights of over a million citizens in Bulgaria 's capital city .
<en> This is a problem which illustrates clearly the corruption schemes which , regrettably , have crept into all areas of life in Bulgaria over the past several years .
<en> For eight years in a row now , with the obvious blessing of both the town hall and the government , the Sofiyska Voda company has been amassing huge profits at the expense of ordinary citizens without delivering even at a minimum level on its obligations undertaken under the concession agreement .
<en> Instead of having the agreement terminated , however , the concession holder receives additional loans amounting to millions of euro .
<en> The government authorities in Bulgaria , both central and municipal , keep turning a blind eye to the numerous protests by citizens ' groups which have finally had to approach Mr. Barroso , the European Commission representative , both through official and unofficial channels during his recent visit to our country .
<en> Since Bulgaria and its institutions do not have the will to protect the rights of the civil society , I trust that the authorities of the European Union will do so .

<en> ( RO ) In April , for the first time Bucharest was present on all media channels only in a favourable light , on the occasion of the NATO Summit that took place in Romania .
<en> Many did not think that our country could organize a summit of this size : 3,000 officials from 49 countries and 3,500 journalists , since the Bucharest Summit had the greatest participation and the most complex agenda in NATO 's history .
<en> I would like to point out three major Summit conclusions : Croatia and Albania were invited to join NATO ; NATO will install an anti-missile shield complementary to the American one - this shield will protect NATO countries that are not covered by the American shield ; the NATO leaders undertook to increase their troops in Afghanistan in order to fight the Taliban , to share the difficulties of military operations and limit restrictions in using their troops .

<en> The next item is Question Time ( B6-0019 / 2008 ) .
<en> The following questions have been submitted to the Commission .
<en> Part I
<sp>
<en> Subject : Exchange of information relating to bank accounts
<en> The recent tax scandal in Liechtenstein had repercussions in many Member States of the EU .
<en> According to investigations by the competent authorities , citizens of the Member States are allegedly involved in tax evasion .
<en> I am informed that the Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States urged the responsible Directorate-General of the Commission to carry out a rapid investigation and propose a revision of the legal framework to permit the exchange of information relating to citizens ' bank accounts .
<en> How will citizens ' personal data be protected under such a framework whilst introducing transparency and preventing the transfer and laundering of illicit funds ?
<en> What procedure will the Commission propose to ensure that the ' opening ' of bank accounts is achieved with the greatest respect for legality ?
<en> In what way is it envisaged that Member States ' taxation systems will be harmonised in order to avoid similar situations in the future whereby illicit funds are laundered through bank accounts ?
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have to combat tax evasion .
<en> If we do not do this , the basis of our democratic society may erode .
<en> Every nation has the right to enact regulations to ensure that taxes are imposed efficiently with the assent of the people 's representatives .
<en> Individual measures in this sector , however , frequently do not have the desired effect nationally .
<en> International cooperation is therefore required between the tax authorities , involving the exchange of information on bank accounts .
<en> The Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States are working together on this at EU level .
<en> Some measures have already been introduced at European level .
<en> Council Directive 2003 / 48 / EC on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments is of particular note here .
<en> In addition , the European Union has concluded agreements with third countries , including Liechtenstein , which pursue the same aim as this Directive .
<en> These agreements guarantee that interest received and paid to EU citizens in these third countries is liable either to income tax in their own Member State or to deduction at source .
<en> Deduction at source can be reimbursed to an individual liable to tax in their Member State of permanent residence if the corresponding income is disclosed for tax purposes .
<en> The Economic and Financial Affairs Council carried out an exchange of views on the application of the Directive on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments on 4 March 2008 .
<en> As a result of the debate , the Ministers asked the Commission to push ahead with work on a report on the implementation of the Directive since it entered into force on 1 July 2005 .
<en> The report should address the definition of the terms ' payment of interest ' and ' beneficial owners ' .
<en> The question rightly being asked here is to what extent systems for exchanging information are compatible with the protection of personal data .
<en> It may be pointed out in this context that the Community rules on data protection , which also apply in the European Economic Area , give Member States the opportunity to take legislative action .
<en> This action can restrict those concerned in some of their rights , such as the right of access or the right to information , if this is necessary for the protection of important financial or economic interests of the European Union or of a Member State .
<en> This also applies to the areas of finance , budgets and taxation .
<en> Comparable restrictions also apply to the effective implementation of the Third Money Laundering Directive .
<en> The Member States must at all events reasonably ensure that their competent bodies comply with the appropriate EU regulations and national data protection regulations when supplying and processing personal data .
<en> A balance has to be found here between the lawful pursuit of aims in terms of taxation policy and the protection of privacy .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , taxation history is full of bogus bank accounts , which are even more harmful when such scandals come to light in European countries .
<en> When it happens , we merely take note of the event , but each time such an incident is repeated our memories flood back .
<en> Is it your overall view , Commissioner , that the system is in actual fact failsafe ?
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) The honourable Member 's question can be answered with a simple no .
<en> The systems we currently have are not watertight ; we know this .
<en> We are therefore making efforts to improve them .
<en> Specific regulations to combat money laundering are definitely open to improvement and we are also making efforts in cooperation with European countries that are part of the European Economic Area but not part of the European Union to achieve these respective improvements .
<en> The Commission has requested and also received a negotiating mandate from the Council authorising it to negotiate specifically with Liechtenstein with regard to how existing weak spots in the system for combating money laundering and tax fraud can be eliminated .
<en> My hope is that the strong public opinion we have witnessed recently in Europe on this issue will help us to reach the necessary agreements .
<en> We are working hard on this , but as you know , tax issues are extraordinarily sensitive .
<en> Even within the Member States , there is definitely still room for improvement here .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , congratulations to an excellent rapporteur , Marco Cappato , on the annual human rights report .
<en> To explain two of our Socialist amendments : firstly , I do respect his and your position about Gandhi and non-violence and I think it is a very important tradition that you draw our attention to in Parliament .
<en> But we seek to delete that paragraph simply because it cannot be the only guiding principle of Europe 's CFSP .
<en> Peace-making and peace-keeping sometimes involve military means and are still an honourable and noble part of what we can and must do as Europe to create a more peaceful and successful world .
<en> Secondly , with regard to our amendment about the UN Human Rights Council , as someone who with subcommittee colleagues regularly goes to Geneva , I share your concerns .
<en> It has been disappointing to see the polarisation that still exists about the occupied Palestinian territories , the bloc mentality , particularly in the African group , though we have to beware of that ourselves in Europe , too .
<en> Nevertheless , I think it is very important this year that we continue to support the spirit of UN reform , that we recognise the positive role played by EU Member States in the Human Rights Council and recognise too that the process of peer review is only just beginning and that to do it openly , comprehensively and effectively is the best way we can support that institution .
<en> Finally , in recital P and paragraph 4 we ask the Commission , together with the Council , to endorse the proposal of a consensus on democracy promotion in the neighbourhood policy , in the Copenhagen Criteria , in our regional strategies in the world .
<en> We talk about democracy promotion but there is no single European definition of it .
<en> The idea , in the same way as we had a consensus on development , that we get the Commission , the Member States and Parliament to jointly define and commit ourselves to democracy promotion in the world is a powerful one .
<en> Mr Solana has supported it and I hope both Council and particularly the Commission go on record as supporting the idea this evening .
<sp>
<en> - ( LT ) Last year 's EU report consisted of 104 pages , 4 of which were dedicated to the subject of human rights .
<en> This year the figures are 216 and 10 accordingly .
<en> Facts stated in last year 's report , such as the development of the Fundamental Rights Agency and Parliament 's work in this sphere , were repeated again .
<en> Nevertheless , the report gives a detailed account of how we Europeans are defending the rights of people worldwide .
<en> However , not a single word has been said either in the report or in the resolution about the protection of human rights or any cases of breaches within the Union .
<en> Are there no cases at all in which human rights have been breached in the EU , or if , perhaps , they do occur , do we in fact resolve them fairly and without delay ?
<en> In my opinion , neither happens to be the case .
<en> It looks as if it is easier to speak about the sins of others than to admit to our own .
<en> Are we not aware of the fact that illegal recruitment agencies in London are making slaves of immigrants from Lithuania and Poland ?
<en> Do we not know that in Paris mass arrests of ' illegal ' persons are taking place by order of President Sarkozy ?
<en> What about the unlawful actions against Romanians in Rome ?
<en> Of course , the aggrieved can appeal to the court in Strasbourg .
<en> In several years ' time , when cases in that court amount to thousands , justice might be restored .
<en> However , every day and every hour is of great importance to the people concerned .
<en> We have been elected to work for our people , represent them and protect their rights .
<en> Let us turn to face them .
<en> In Europe every person should be safe .
<en> Then we would be stronger and in a better position to help others .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mrs Juknevičienė .
<en> This is a case of ' looking at the speck in someone else 's eye and failing to see the plank in our own eye ' .
<sp>
<en> - ( DA ) Mr President , thank you for a superb report on human rights .
<en> It has one very serious fault , however .
<en> The world 's biggest human rights problem - the discrimination against 260 million casteless Dalits - is mentioned only briefly , and even then only in connection with a list of things that could give rise to discrimination .
<en> In February last year , we approved a far-reaching decision in this matter , and it is therefore alarming that the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance was rejected by the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
<en> We proposed that , together with the UN , the EU should prepare guidelines to combat caste discrimination and raise the problem at summit meetings with the countries concerned .
<en> Have India and the British Government been at it again , as they were against the decision last year , and have they succeeded this time ?
<en> The problem exists in many South Asian countries , but I mention India because it is democratic , a fact that was underlined as the most important factor in connection with human rights .
<en> It is democratic and it even has good laws against caste discrimination .
<en> However , these laws are continually being violated .
<en> India 's democracy deserves these laws to be respected , and India should become a model for others .
<en> It is , however , also embarrassing that the EU is turning its face away from the suffering of the Dalits - and so is Parliament !
<en> We could say these things last year .
<en> What has happened , that we cannot say them today ?
<en> Are things improving for the Dalits ?
<en> Is the discrimination in the process of disappearing ?
<en> No , everyone here knows that this is not the case .
<en> Why , then , should the desperate situation of these people not receive the active attention of the EU ?
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , thank you very much .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , on 13 April Ennaama Asfari , a human rights defender in the Western Sahara , was arrested in Marrakech .
<en> Yet another arrest in Morocco .
<en> I am telling you this , ladies and gentlemen , in order to say that we should not forget that the European Union is responsible for the decolonisation process backed by the United Nations .
<en> We are responsible , and therefore any human rights report must say that the European Union should be exacting and vigilant and must comply with UN Security Council resolutions .
<en> Secondly , ladies and gentlemen , we are in a civilisation , in the 21st century , in which the population is getting poorer and hungrier , and there is more disease and more inequality .
<en> In the last ten years , according to the United Nations , Africa has become poorer .
<en> I would therefore like to demand , suggest , and ask that it be recognised that human rights means all rights : economic , social , cultural and political rights .
<en> If we had a scale , we would be very surprised to see the ranking of countries that do not respect human rights .
<en> I therefore think that we should have much greater awareness and raise all issues of compliance with human rights .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the report by Manolis Mavrommatis , on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education , on the White Paper on Sport .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let me first thank the Commission and Commissioner Figeľ for their initiative in drawing up the White Paper on Sport and the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan .
<2en> This is the EU 's first effort to deal with sporting matters .
<2en> May I also thank Commissioner Špidla for being here today in place of Commissioner Figeľ , who is travelling outside Europe .
<2en> My thanks also go to my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , the Committee on Legal Affairs , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality .
<2en> They have cooperated excellently in drafting the report on the White Paper on Sport .
<2en> In the European Parliament report , the key points of the White Paper were covered by 16 conciliation amendments jointly agreed by all the political groups in the Committee on Culture .
<2en> The main points were also covered by 426 amendments tabled to the lead committee and to the other seven committees , which gave their opinions .
<2en> Doping is once again the focus of attention because there are unfortunate examples of it every year in almost every sport .
<2en> Through the White Paper , the European Parliament seeks to adopt measures allowing athletes not be forced by their heavy schedules to resort to performance- and stamina-enhancing substances .
<2en> In addition , internal and external independent checks on professional associations and sports organisations , as well as educating male and female athletes on the side effects of doping may help to curb this problem .
<2en> Debates have focused on two issues of the financial side of sport .
<2en> The first is sports betting .
<2en> We in the Committee on Culture all agree that the possible deregulation of the gaming and lotteries market will be problematic for the funding of amateur sport so long as the existing system of state betting agencies provides it with considerable income .
<2en> For this reason , the White Paper calls on Member States and the Commission to adopt regulations which ensure that amateur and professional sport is protected from any improper influence relating to betting .
<2en> While continuing to protect the betting market , we are thus increasing transparency , and also guaranteeing the state aid for amateur sport , culture and other social activities .
<2en> The second issue is the sale of media rights .
<2en> As we all know , the 27 EU Member States go about selling television rights for major sporting events in different ways .
<2en> This is especially true of Champions League matches and the UEFA Cup .
<2en> Rights can be sold either individually or collectively , but they are the main source of income for professional sport in Europe .
<2en> Similarly , rights to sports events are a vital source of programme content and income for many media owners .
<2en> Parliament 's report also recognises the importance of fairly redistributing income among sports associations , however small , and between professional and amateur sport .
<2en> The collective sale of media rights , which the Commission presents as incompatible with competition law , is therefore important for the redistribution of income .
<2en> It may thus help to achieve greater solidarity among sports .
<2en> We therefore call on the Commission to recognise collective sales and accept that such practical solidarity among small sports clubs is sanctioned by law .
<2en> Lastly , as we stated in the Belet report on professional football , UEFA and FIFA should reach agreement and work with the agencies of the Commission .
<2en> They must ensure that football is universally accepted by the citizens and Member States of the EU without losing its independence ; it must not overstep the powers conferred on it by the statutes .
<2en> It is important for everyone that UEFA and FIFA recognise in their statutes the right of recourse to common courts .
<2en> We must , of course , accept the principle of self-regulation and the structures of the European model of sport governing the organisation of sports events .
<2en> Let me end by reaffirming the satisfaction we all feel at the official recognition of sport by the Member States in the reformed Lisbon Treaty .
<2en> We do of course recognise and respect the special nature of sport .
<2en> It is of great significance for Member States and the sporting world in general that the EU will in future be able to substantially contribute to and promote European policy on sport .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) In the first place I should present apologies from my colleague Commissioner Figeľ , who cannot take part in this sitting because of a long-planned working visit to Egypt .
<en> I accepted the proposal that I should deputise for him with pleasure , inter alia because much of what falls within my competence is closely related to sport .
<en> I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent report that he and his colleagues in Parliament have spent six months preparing .
<en> I am convinced that the report is a balanced document and deals with all the relevant themes .
<en> Thank you for the European Parliament 's support for the White Paper on Sport and for your high level of cooperation with the European Commission .
<en> As the European Parliament has emphasised , it is important to recall the principle of the applicability of Community law to sports in Europe , whilst also respecting the specific nature of sport .
<en> Therefore the European Commission remains active on sport , and from now on will apply Community law , including the competition rules , to that area .
<en> The White Paper and its annexes are useful aids for sporting organisations and for Member States in the concrete application of the acquis communautaire to decisions in the area of competition and to judgments of the European Court of Justice .
<en> On the question of the specific nature of sport , the European Commission will lead and support open dialogue with sports organisations , Member States and the European Parliament within the framework of the structured dialogue on sport .
<en> This dialogue will be conducted in such a way that issues of the specific characteristics of sport will be dealt with concretely .
<en> The European Commission does not have any general objections to the amendments to be discussed at this plenary session , especially if their aim is to preserve the proper and equal participation of representative structures in controlling sport .
<en> However , we cannot agree with an unconditional obligation for young players to sign their first professional contract with the club that has trained them , because this infringes the fundamental freedom of free movement of workers .
<en> Meanwhile , as you know , the implementation of the White Paper is continuing according to plan .
<en> Twenty-six of the 53 actions in the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan have already been carried out ; this year , for example , three studies will be initiated ( with results in 2009 ) , on the following themes : sports funding , players ' agents , and volunteering in sport .
<en> In autumn last year , under the leadership of my colleagues , Commissioner Frattini and Commissioner Figeľ , a conference took place on the high level of violence in sport , which identified concrete methods that could achieve an improvement in combating this phenomenon .
<en> The results of measuring the impact of sport on the economy can also be viewed as a significant success .
<en> As far as the matter of ' home-grown players ' is concerned , a short time ago the European Commission was handed the results of an independent expert report analysing UEFA 's rules .
<en> The European Commission is at this very moment examining the compatibility of these rules with Community law .
<en> New possibilities for funding sport and physical activities have also been opened up by various EU programmes , especially the lifelong learning programmes ' Youth in action and ' Europe for citizens ' .
<en> We hope that the Lisbon Treaty will soon come into force and we are delighted with the European Parliament 's support for the preparatory actions in the field of sport , which contribute to implementation of the new EU competence in this area .
<en> Allow me to thank you once again for your contribution , support and splendid cooperation in this important , sensitive and very popular area .
<sp>
<en> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - ( NL ) Well , Mr Špidla has said it all .
<en> An important role has been set aside in sport for employment , for social affairs .
<en> Sport does indeed have an important social function , for example fighting problems such as racism .
<en> Racism in society is reflected by racism in sport .
<en> I am extremely glad of the attention that this White Paper pays to eliminating racism and discrimination , in both professional and amateur sport .
<en> Sport also has many advantages for , to take some examples , social inclusion , integration of migrants or reintegration into the labour market .
<en> For this reason I welcome the Commission 's recommendation to direct the Member States to make use of the EU 's existing funds .
<en> Furthermore , sport is becoming more and more professional , and there is a need for good training for sportswomen and sportsmen so that after their careers they can return to society .
<en> I have one final point : it is also important to improve the professional qualities of sports managers and for this reason we support a licensing system at European level .
<sp>
<en> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - ( NL ) I would like to thank the Members for their extremely pleasant cooperation on this report .
<en> I think , however , that it must have taken a great deal of time to achieve this proposal .
<en> I find , sadly , that in some matters it does not go far enough .
<en> It is very important , in my opinion , to create guidelines to which sporting organisations can commit themselves .
<en> When it comes to State support , we should aim for the same treatment throughout Europe , particularly where professional sporting organisations are concerned .
<en> I also find that the distinction between the specific characteristics of sport and the economic activities that frequently accompany sport is a little too explicit , because I believe that economic activities - including those that protect sport - cannot have exceptions made for them in the Treaty .
<en> That is fortunately also not mentioned in this report .
<en> That is also the reason why I wholeheartedly support it .
<en> I think it is good that sporting organisations have started talking more than they did formerly about this subject , and that is a significant step forward .
<en> Thank you very much .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality . - ( SV ) Mr President , let me say a big thank you to the Commissioner , Meglena Kuneva , and rapporteur Lasse Lehtinen .
<en> I welcome the strategy and am very glad that consumers are being treated as an important group to look after .
<en> We know that we shall never get a flourishing internal market unless we have satisfied and secure consumers .
<en> But I share the rapporteur 's view that the strategy calls for continuous follow-up if it is really to develop to the consumers ' advantage .
<en> As rapporteur for the strategy in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , however , I am disappointed that the main reporting committee did not take account of more than one of our 13 amendments .
<en> They contain many important and worthwhile proposals .
<en> We wanted to see a clearer gender perspective .
<en> Consumer policy is definitely not gender-neutral .
<en> Gender should be taken into account just as children , the elderly and the disabled are taken into account .
<en> I hope that this can be taken up again in the next review .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , my thanks to Mr Lehtinen and to the shadow rapporteurs for the good cooperation over the last few months .
<en> This report introduces some very positive elements in the area of consumer policy moving forward .
<en> Consumers can only exercise their rights if they are aware of those rights , and empowerment of consumers in the EU is a central element of this report , and this will be achieved through education and awareness campaigns .
<en> Special focus will be given to equip consumers with the skills and tools needed to increase their confidence in the digital environment .
<en> The report commends the Commission 's efforts to strengthen cooperation in the area of product safety and at international level , in particular with Chinese and US authorities .
<en> Continued dialogue and information-sharing on product safety is in the interest of all parties and is central to building consumer confidence .
<en> In relation to consumer redress , together with my PPE-DE colleagues I strongly support easy and effective access to redress for all consumers in the EU .
<en> We know that non-judicial forms of redress are the preferred solution of most consumers as they serve consumers ' interests most rapidly at the lowest possible cost .
<en> As I have stated since the outset of discussions , I do not support calls for legislative action to introduce an ill-thought-out system of collective redress in the EU .
<en> The Commission is currently preparing various studies on existing systems of consumer redress in the Member States and rather than pre-empt the results of the Commission studies I , together with my PPE-DE colleagues , call for a strong role for Parliament and the Member States in assessing the results of the studies before deciding upon further action .
<en> It is not in consumers ' interests to hastily introduce a system of collective redress which would be both costly and ineffective .
<en> In all other respects I support the report .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , may I express my thanks to Mr Lehtinen for the really good draft report he has given us , which provides us with a very sound basis for our discussions .
<en> I should like to highlight three very important points from this report .
<en> The first is the need to ensure that a leading role is played by instruments which we already possess in the European Union for the promotion of safety and prevention .
<en> This is why it is very important that the RAPEX system should be further improved so that it can serve the interests of consumers even more effectively .
<en> The second very important point is that Solvit , which is such a key instrument , should be nurtured and improved .
<en> There is still a very considerable information gap among consumers , too many of whom have never heard of Solvit and do not know that it could resolve a good few problems for them .
<en> That is also very important .
<en> I am also very gratified that the European Commission is to examine the EE symbol again .
<en> Many people believe that the EE symbol is a safety mark , but unfortunately it is not .
<en> We should ensure , together with you and Commissioner Verheugen , that the rules governing this symbol are formulated so as to enable us to assure the public in future that they can rely on the safety of products bearing the EE mark .
<en> That is a very important aim .
<en> The last and most important point , however , in the view of my group is the system of collective redress that we in the Socialist Group are advocating .
<en> The entire statute book serves no purpose if consumers cannot assert their enshrined rights , be it because there is a cross-border dimension which makes the law very difficult to enforce or because there are many small claims for minor losses , although these can certainly suck people dry over time .
<en> It is absolutely essential that we not only encourage the European Commission to examine and develop such a system but actually urge it to do so and to present us with an appropriate piece of draft legislation as soon as possible so that we can really give consumers due security and protection .
<en> I very much regret that the PPE-DE Group has not seen fit to advocate this system with the vigour and commitment that are needed to give consumers and the public at large real confidence in the European Union and the internal market , for such confidence comes from knowing that they are properly protected when they go shopping in Europe .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , may I begin by congratulating Lasse Lehtinen on this good and balanced draft report .
<en> We are in agreement on very many points .
<en> One reason for this has been the very good preliminary work of the Commission in this case .
<en> There are few contentious points .
<en> Consumer strategy will be one of the main topics of discussion during the next stage in the development of the internal market .
<en> At the heart of the three main challenges facing the European Union , namely growth , employment and the recognition and satisfaction of people 's needs , are 490 million consumers .
<en> The internal market has the potential to become the world 's largest retail market .
<en> This is why the ALDE Group supports the Commission 's targeted efforts to create one large retail market out of 27 mini-markets .
<en> We also welcome the way in which the draft reinforces the horizontal element of consumer policy as well as its proposal for the appointment of what it calls consumer-liaison officers .
<en> In this context I should make special mention of the proposed strengthening of the European Consumer Centres and the particular attention given to the needs of children and elderly people .
<en> May I also say something on the subject of collective redress , with which we have a problem .
<en> We have had little information and much dogma .
<en> I believe it would be premature , Meglena , to say that you will have the solid backing of Parliament on this matter .
<en> We have just heard from the PPE-DE Group that it will not back you .
<en> I believe the PPE-DE is failing to recognise the real problems .
<en> There is a scatter-gun type of damage that affects many consumers in more than one country .
<en> It is legitimate for the Commission to give some thought to this whole matter and examine it in a study .
<en> On the other hand we have PSE dogma , which craves this instrument at all costs as a political tool , regardless of the real problems - and the real problems are manifold .
<en> There is , for example , the problem of the legal basis .
<en> Where in the Treaty does it say that we here in the Commission and Parliament are entitled to interfere with the Member States ' codes of civil and criminal procedure ?
<en> What did Diana Wallis just tell us on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs ?
<en> The problem of contract law is still unresolved .
<en> The question of opting in or opting out , the role of the Ombudsman - there are many problems to resolve .
<en> It is simply not enough to say we do not want the US system .
<en> The Americans also had the best of intentions when they first created their system .
<en> It goes without saying that they did not intentionally create a bad system at the outset .
<en> For these reasons we should maintain an agnostic , critical position .
<en> We should wait for the study , take its findings seriously and then engage in an informed , non-dogmatic and responsible discussion , as befits this Parliament .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , Mr Lehtinen 's report deals with the major issues of pro-quality strategy for the coming years .
<en> That strategy is important for the citizens of the Union , and I want to stress some of the problems involved .
<en> In the creation of national and EU law there should be greater input from consumer organisations , which are encountering difficulties in pursuing their activities and obtaining funding in certain countries .
<en> The Union should provide more substantive and financial assistance to those organisations .
<en> The collective redress systems applicable in certain countries should be used against dishonest market players , and a collective redress system should be introduced at European level .
<en> European consumer centres in the individual countries , as well as consumer organisations and consumer rights spokesmen , should step up information and education activities aimed at special protection for the most vulnerable consumers .
<en> Protection can be made more effective through the involvement of the Solvit and RAPEX consumer centres .
<en> We support this report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) I welcome the Commission 's report on the EU consumer policy strategy and I also appreciate your efforts , Commissioner Kuneva , to promote a consumer culture based on consumer awareness and better access to information .
<en> I believe that strong and independent consumer organisations are the backbone of an effective consumer policy and I am happy that Mr Lehtinen 's report included the changes I proposed in article 7 , where Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide sufficient finance for consumer organisations .
<en> This concerns primarily financial support for intensive training programs aimed at those working in consumer organisations .
<en> Consumer organisations are best informed about consumers ' needs and should therefore be consulted on all areas of consumer policy that will affect consumers .
<en> I fully support the two amendments proposed by my political group , the PPE-DE , to Article 40 of the report dealing with collective redress .
<en> Only if such a need is identified by the impact study should the Commission propose a European framework , which would give all consumers in all the Member States easy access to various redress mechanisms in cross-border complaints .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) In the context of the European Union consumer protection strategy , I would like to mention the importance of quality of services and products .
<en> If consumers are already used to resorting to consumer protection offices in relation to products , this does not happen when it comes to services .
<en> Many times , consumers sign contracts for the supply of services without reading the contractual provisions carefully and if they do read them carefully they believe they cannot propose any amendments thereof .
<en> In fact , they do not have the same power of negotiation the suppliers of services have , although some observations from consumers could improve the content of contracts and increase their confidence .
<en> I would like to draw attention to the need to protect tourists and passengers as regards compliance with their rights which , unfortunately , many of them do not know and claim .
<en> Special attention should be given to electronic services as well .
<en> The consumers ' confidence in digital services is essential for the European Union 's competitiveness and , especially , for the development of economy based on knowledge .
<en> In conclusion , I would like to mention the fact that we also have to speak about the quality of public services and , in this context , about consumer protection .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) First of all , I would like to congratulate Mr. Lehtinen for the consistent report .
<en> Nevertheless , I would like to make an observation regarding Paragraph 35 of the report .
<en> This paragraph refers to the creation of a European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman 's office .
<en> This proposal seems to be a very complicated and not very efficient procedure to me .
<en> First of all , the creation of such a position requires financial resources .
<en> We would have a redistribution of funds between the European consumer protection centres and the potential new Ombudsman .
<en> Secondly , bureaucracy would increase at the level of the European Union .
<en> Last but not least , we would have an overlapping of the newly-created Ombudsman 's tasks and the European consumer protection centres .
<en> I don 't believe that a new instrument would bring more efficiency in solving the complaints filed by European consumers .
<en> But I do think that an efficient and thorough implementation of the legislation would reduce the dissatisfaction related to the internal market operation .
<en> In conclusion , I request the European Commission representatives to take into consideration Paragraph 7 , by which we request the allocation of adequate funds to the consumer organizations across the European Union .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Mr President , globalisation of our market requires strong , clear and easily enforceable consumer rights and I am happy to see the Commission making very successful efforts in this area .
<en> In my report last year I pointed out that consumer confidence in e-commerce would be enhanced by sample consumer contracts and by better mechanisms for dealing with complaints , as well as by the European trustmark and the consumer charter .
<en> However , I do not think that a European Consumer Ombudsman will help us a great deal .
<en> We need instead to increase financial support for the existing consumer organisations and supervisory bodies in the Member States , because they are the bodies that are increasingly identifying the unsafe products from Asia , namely toys , children 's shoes and sports equipment .
<en> The citizens expect us to come up with a more successful means of dealing with cross-border complaints , as has already been said here many times .
<en> That is further justification for harmonising the rules in the Member States .
<en> However , collective redress is problematic ; it may be good for the lawyers , but it is often very costly for consumers or providers .
<en> I therefore welcome the Commission 's intention to assess the results of the German or British model first and only then to consider the possible way forward , not being pushed into a blind alley by the Socialists .
<en> I would like to express my appreciation of the work done by our rapporteur and that of the Commission on the reform of the consumer policy .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I intend to make my fellow Member Malcolm Harbour happy tomorrow by wearing my red suit to show him that the red corner really does know what it wants .
<en> That , in fact , is the difference between what we on the Left are seeking and what those on the Right are up to , namely creating a big blue smokescreen to hide the fact that they do not actually want consumer protection at all but are committed first and foremost to the defence of industrial interests .
<en> It is only right that this should be made clear for once .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Congratulations to the rapporteur , Mrs Van Lancker , on preparing this significant report .
<2en> I would also like to thank the rapporteur for her helpful cooperation and understanding in the acceptance of amendments .
<2en> I consider this document to have the right balance and I hope it will find the support of the majority in tomorrow 's vote .
<2en> I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission Communication to the Council contains an extremely welcome proposal that would encourage the development of the market and increase employment .
<2en> This is the freedom of knowledge , which would be added to the four fundamental freedoms - the free movement of goods , services , persons and capital .
<2en> This fifth freedom should help speed up the EU 's transition to a modern , creative knowledge economy .
<2en> It would in turn strengthen the knowledge triangle of scientific research , education and innovation within the EU .
<2en> The initiative proposed by the Commission is no doubt a very good one .
<2en> However , no one would argue against the importance of the original four freedoms in increasing employment .
<2en> Nevertheless , it happens that some Member States fail to adhere to EU policy and even breach the legal norms .
<2en> In pursuing protective policy , they prevent the free movement of capital and persons and jeopardise the development not only of their own countries , but of the EU as a whole .
<2en> In my view , the free movement of services will not guarantee the freedom of development of small and medium-sized enterprises .
<2en> Let us not forget Winston Churchill 's observation that if you destroy a free market , you create a black market .
<2en> The Commission and the Member States should realise that we can achieve much more together than by going our separate ways .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we in the group of the Greens / European Free Alliance warmly welcome Mrs Van Lancker 's report because it would be fatal if the Council were to announce full-bodied reforms in employment policy guidelines for 2008 and then say : actually , we don 't want a reform !
<en> Commissioner , you are absolutely right when you say that reform fatigue seems to have occurred at the Commission and also particularly in the Council .
<en> The Van Lancker report , however , clearly sets the right priorities .
<en> I should particularly like to emphasise the setting of new priorities in social integration .
<en> It is vital that the message goes out from here that we cannot forget the people outside and that they are important to us .
<en> Secondly , we Greens have made a considerable contribution to ensuring that this Parliament report has a substantial gender mainstreaming dimension - consistently - and that family policy is not completely sold out as gender mainstreaming policy .
<en> Gender mainstreaming is broader and concerns women - not men and women , as is the case in family policy .
<en> We Greens , however , will continue to take a discerning look at the flexicurity sector until social protection is guaranteed .
<en> I should once again like to point out that we need reform and not stalemate .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the common employment policy for Member States is undergoing a test .
<en> It is increasingly throwing up employment growth programmes for various age groups , taking account of their specific needs and potential and the threat of problems with finding work .
<en> Under the Lisbon Strategy , these programmes above all envisage investment in people and in their education , and better chances in the job market .
<en> A rise in employment by 3.6 million people in 2007 and an anticipated rise in employment by 4.5 million in 2008-2009 is the perceptible result of this policy .
<en> This means that promoting an approach to work that matches the human life cycle , concern for young people not completing their education and for adapting work conditions to family needs , and especially to parental duties , eliminating discrimination in the workplace , particularly in the scope of access to training and other forms of skill refinement , and gradually restricting occupational activity among older people should in future constitute the basis for action in this sphere .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I too join the ranks of those who wish to thank the rapporteur for her work , for the report that stresses the importance of one of the pillars of the European Community , namely the European social model .
<en> I welcome the fact that the report accentuates issues such as enhancing social integration , combating poverty and emphasising social inclusion in employment policies .
<en> The rapporteur also rightly accentuates the need to promote gender equality at work .
<en> These positive aspects notwithstanding , the way our political group sees it , the draft resolution puts more emphasis on the principle of flexibility than on true provision of good job opportunities and the right to quality work .
<en> I sympathise with the rapporteur .
<en> It is difficult to find a compromise solution between these two options .
<en> I regret that the committee adopted only one of the many motions tabled by our political group , and under these circumstances I have to say that in spite of all the compromise solutions that were adopted we will not be able to support the final report .
<en> In spite of that , I must say that I was honoured to work with the rapporteur .
<en> The future , the outcome of the flexibility concept , the new social experience and the citizens of the European Union will all decide , in the end , which of us is closer to the truth in searching for , and implementing , the social Europe project .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , the conclusion of this strategic report on the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs is that the Lisbon Strategy is working .
<en> However , the rapporteur draws attention to the fact that the Strategy for Jobs is not delivering for all citizens .
<en> Six million young people in the EU leave school early and 16 % of the total EU population are poor or at risk of poverty .
<en> This is a key challenge but , unfortunately , in the list of people that are at risk we have again lost the opportunity to include carers .
<en> Carers are the largest workforce in Europe .
<en> They are not people out of work but people working harder than many people who are in the labour force .
<en> When I brought up the issue of carers in committee , I was told that carers - people caring for our older people , people with disabilities and children - are people on career breaks .
<en> To call caring a ' career break ' is to show ignorance of what carers do and the value of what they do .
<en> Please , Commissioner , bring carers into focus and support them .
<en> Carers are the key to how we manage our ageing European population in terms of meeting the needs of our older citizens and stabilising our birth rates .
<en> So make carers a priority .
<en> Hopefully in this Parliament we will also specifically look at the issue of carers .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I would like to begin by saying that I wish to speak specifically on the Ţicău Report .
<en> While we have a proposal that is largely unproblematic , I would like to comment on the issue of sanctions .
<en> It is important to understand that we need common sanctions , but we also need to address the issue of common enforceability .
<en> Whilst I am against more red tape , we must find a system whereby drivers and their companies can be more easily prosecuted when they cause accidents in other Member States .
<en> At present , such companies and their drivers are escaping prosecution for offences caused , for example , in the United Kingdom , as the paperwork required to bring them to justice is currently too great .
<en> This is particularly alarming when we consider that according to my information there has been a 75 % increase in road traffic accidents by drivers from other Member States in parts of my constituency alone in the past five years .
<en> I regularly receive complaints from people who have been quite badly injured by commercial vehicles and their drivers and it is frustrating that our present police enforcement services are either unable or unwilling to hold these drivers to account .
<en> I therefore look forward to further developments in this area so that we can ease the path in bringing these reckless individuals to justice .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , we are holding this discussion at a rather specific time - that is , when we have lost a good Commissioner for Transport , by whom I mean Jacques Barrot - a time when we are awaiting a new Commissioner .
<en> In fact , I am interested in whether the designated candidate for Commissioner is listening to our discussion today , as that would surely be justified in every possible respect .
<en> We are talking here about the road haulage sector , a sector that has made it possible to achieve a 40 % rise in economic exchange between the EU Member States in the last five years .
<en> We are talking about a sector that is de facto keeping Europe moving .
<en> My view is that we need as much freedom as possible here , including in cabotage .
<en> At the same time , though , we need as much firmness as possible , especially in combating practices such as the existence of rogue coach operators , who are frankly wrecking the market .
<en> The sanction of withdrawing their licence is not applicable , as they do not have and have never had any such licence .
<en> Throughout the sector , though , I can see several significant threats : the price of fuel and its rise , the way in which external transport costs are internalised , the way in which working time is executed , and I also have the impression that the profitability of haulage companies is generally falling .
<en> This is why I would like to offer my particularly enthusiastic support to Mr Piecyk 's report , in order to be able to discuss the issue of bus and coach transport and to vote in June .
<en> I support Mr Sterckx 's position on the need for a new study of the consequences of opening up the market , but this should also be linked to an assessment of the economic wellbeing of the road haulage sector .
<sp>
<en> ( ES ) Mr President , I would first like to discuss Mrs Ţicău 's report .
<en> This proposal is key to modernising the occupation of transport operator , through the uniform application of common rules in all Member States to authorise access to that profession .
<en> In this respect I applaud and willingly welcome the Commission 's proposal .
<en> However , I would like to repeat a question that I raised during the debate on this report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
<en> It is regarding the term ' good repute ' , which I put forward , and which , in the interests of consensus , I then withdrew and proposed substituting it with ' ethical standards ' .
<en> I am not in any way questioning this requirement ; on the contrary , I agree that it should be required that transport managers should not have any serious criminal convictions or serious sanctions for infringements of Community legislation relating to road transport .
<en> I do , however , advocate changing the term , because we are presuming bad practice in a profession that is a key sector of the European economy , that generates wealth , creates employment and guarantees the mobility of people and goods .
<en> We should think carefully before assuming that someone is not of good repute to pursue an occupation if that is not proven .
<en> Secondly , I would like to highlight the importance of Mr Grosch 's report on common rules for access to the road haulage market .
<en> The proposal for a regulation defines cabotage operations , putting an end to the current legal uncertainty .
<en> It allows up to three consecutive transport operations for an international carriage of seven days .
<en> However , we should go further in order to lift any restrictions on cabotage and achieve greater liberalisation of national markets .
<en> Finally , I applaud the reduction in bureaucracy that this new proposal for a regulation brings in relation to the new simplified formats for the Community licence , copies of this licence and the drivers ' certificates , that will help to reduce the delays caused by roadside checks .
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , we need to make the transport sector more efficient and more competitive .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) I would like to congratulate the two Rapporteurs for their work and refer to the Ţicău report .
<en> I welcome the introduction of the criteria for quality access to the profession of road transport operator into the report in order to the quality of licensed operators and not to restrict their access to the profession .
<en> Whether we speak about people or goods , the profession of road transport operator involves the performance of indispensable activities for the economic development of the Union , in harmony with the Lisbon objectives to stimulate the economic activity in the European Area .
<en> I believe the implementation of this Regulation will result in an increase in the number of jobs , as well as in achieving a higher degree of safety and correctness related to road transport in the European Union .
<en> Again , congratulations to the Rapporteurs .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , here in the European Union , we are always proud - and quite rightly so , more often than not - that we try to find the middle ground and work together to find a solution , and that we often succeed in this .
<en> It is not always easy .
<en> Today 's joint debate on the reports by Mrs Ţicău and Mr Grosch provides some particularly good examples of this , and also some exceptionally bad ones : the 12-day rule and cabotage have been mentioned more than once .
<en> The 12-day rule is good ; hopefully it also brings social benefits .
<en> However , for a certain sector of the low-cost tourism market , it has become an increasing problem , and we want to take consumers ' interests into account here as well .
<en> We have heard that attempts are being made to arrive at a good compromise , for which perhaps a little more time is needed .
<en> If it is a matter of a limited time - and that is indeed the case - then perhaps we should also take this time .
<en> The same applies to the cabotage rules .
<en> We are all agreed that we want to see better use made of the diverse infrastructures .
<en> However , this naturally affects many areas , particularly the transport industry , and the interests in the Member States vary widely on this .
<en> I am not entirely sure whether , when it comes to the topic of cabotage , a little ' euromythology ' does not come into play here - simply because of the many years it has been under discussion .
<en> I would like to know whether there are really as many unladen journeys represented in the long lines of trucks that we have to overtake on the motorways - or are not allowed to overtake , as the case may be - as we are always being told .
<en> Perhaps an ' I 'm running unladen ' flag would be of interest here .
<en> However , the heart of our debate today is not so much the legislation we pass but what the Member States will put into effect , apply and implement .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Before we proceed to the vote itself , there is just one point which I would like to make .
<en> I would ask you to listen very carefully now , and then some of the chairmen of the parliamentary groups will be given the floor .
<en> There is an amendment which has been proposed by Mr Trakatellis , Mr Varvitsiotis , Mr Papastamkos , Mr Lambrinidis and other Members regarding one particular week in the year 2009 , namely week 16 , from 13 to 19 April .
<en> This is the week directly before the Orthodox Easter .
<en> It is not Easter itself , but the week before .
<en> However , no proposal has been made for a part-session in this particular week , as it is the group week .
<en> That means that this amendment is not admissible because there is no proposal for the European Parliament to meet in this particular week .
<en> However , this does not imply a preliminary decision concerning the proposed part-session from 20 to 23 April .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue , and this includes interreligious dialogue .
<en> Thus I ask you , in your capacity as the European Parliament , to set an example and respect minorities .
<en> It is for this reason , in a spirit of compromise and goodwill towards our Orthodox friends , that my Group suggests the following amendment to the calendar of part-sessions for 2009 .
<en> Week 17 , the plenary week in April 2009 , will commence on 21 April and end on 24 April - I do not wish to say any more than that - to allow the Members concerned to celebrate the Orthodox Easter .
<en> On behalf of all countries with an Orthodox tradition , I thank you for your support and ask you not to create any additional controversy .
<en> I wish to ask , however , for the support of the European Parliament out of respect for minorities , to set an example for our fellow citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I assume that this is an oral amendment .
<en> That was not stated , but if it is an oral amendment , my Group is in favour of voting on it today .
<en> It is also a fact that many Catholics work here on religious holidays ; tomorrow is one such day , despite the strike .
<en> That situation also arises , but I would nonetheless recommend that we vote in favour of this motion or at least put it to the vote .
<en> Mr President , if you find that it is not admissible , the groups should try afterwards to achieve a consensus in this spirit .
<sp>
<en> There are certain issues on which we must have a consensus and I suggest that we proceed as Mr Daul and Mr Swoboda have proposed .
<en> This will be voted on at the end .
<en> We will take the other amendments first .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , before the vote , I would like to point out a problem which affects the vote and which may need to be discussed and resolved .
<en> In the calendar proposed , there is a reference to the date of the elections in 2009 .
<en> We are not voting on that now , we are simply noting it .
<en> However , because of the date of the elections , the constituent sitting of Parliament will take place in July 2009 .
<en> That being the case , Members from some countries have concerns because , if you look closely , it is clear that , if the constituent sitting takes place on 14 July 2009 , some Members will not achieve the requisite five years for pension rights .
<en> In some Member States , they do not use the legislative term but a fixed period because the legislative terms in the Member States vary in length .
<en> I think that there are good grounds to consider and resolve this problem , either as regards the date of the election or the date of the constituent sitting .
<en> I would therefore ask Parliament 's Legal Service to look at this issue .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I would like to make a similar proposal .
<en> I am astonished that the right of minorities is being deployed in such moralistic terms .
<en> There are around seven Jewish festive days which cannot be observed because they are working days .
<en> The same applies to 13 Protestant festive days as well .
<en> The constituent sitting is being held on 14 July .
<en> This is one of the most important secular holidays .
<en> Can we work in France on 14 July as we commemorate the French Revolution ?
<en> I think that is impossible and inappropriate .
<en> That needs to be changed as well , please !
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> We have noted what has been said and shall now proceed to the vote .
<en> ( Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We actually want all the sittings of the European Parliament to be held in Brussels and we want the travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg to end as soon as possible .
<en> We have therefore voted for the proposals that the Monday sittings and Thursday afternoon sittings during Strasbourg part-sessions should be discontinued , in the hope that the sittings in Strasbourg will be phased out completely .
<en> The European Parliament should have a single seat and a single place of work .
<en> It is regrettable that there are Member States whose political leaders consider themselves to be strong supporters of the European idea but at the same time will not give an inch when their national interests are at stake .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am generally in favour of what is proposed for the 2009 calendar of part-sessions .
<en> However , I believe that amendments requesting an extension of the time spent in Strasbourg would not contribute to the efficient running of the Parliament .
<en> Indeed , efficiency and logic demands that there be one single Parliament seat in Brussels .
<en> My views on this issue are reflected in my vote .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) We regard as positive the recognition of the environmental and social problems arising from the closure of mercury mines in the Community .
<en> We also regard as positive the acceptance that projects and other initiatives must continue to be supported , based on the available financing instruments , in order to allow affected areas to find viable solutions for the local environment , employment and economic activity .
<en> It has also been agreed that the permit applicant must take the necessary measures , through a financial guarantee or equivalent mechanism , to ensure that the obligations arising from the permit ( including maintenance operations after closure ) shall be fulfilled and that the closure operations shall be carried out .
<en> It has also been approved that industry sectors that gain mercury from the cleaning of natural gas or as a by-product from non-ferrous mining and smelting operations must provide relevant data to the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States concerned .
<en> The Commission shall make this information publicly available .
<en> We also feel it is right to encourage the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , especially assistance which facilitates the shift towards alternative mercury-free technologies and the eventual phase-out of uses and releases of mercury and mercury compounds .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted for this report which aims to bring the ban on exports of mercury forward to 15 March 2011 , three months before the date proposed by the Council .
<en> Mercury can be produced by waste recycling ( fluorescent tubes or batteries , for instance ) , cleaning of natural gas or industrial processing of non-ferrous metals .
<en> I am pleased that , in addition to metallic mercury , the ban includes mercury-containing products that cannot be sold or distributed in the European Union , cinnabar ore and mercury compounds .
<en> It is likewise extremely important that compounds used for research and development , in medicines or in analytic processes not be included in the ban , as stated in the report .
<en> Storage must be made secure , as suggested by both the report and the Council .
<en> Mercury waste stored temporarily for more than one year must be kept in deep underground hard rock formations or in above-ground facilities in such a way as to prevent any risk to human health and the environment before it is processed .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I generally support Dimitrios Papadimoulis ' report on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury .
<en> Bringing forward the date of the export ban to 2010 allows for greater coherence with the EU 's overall mercury strategy .
<en> I also support the extension of the types of mercury covered within the ban .
<en> I further feel that , before the ban comes into force , more research is required regarding safe disposal methods for mercury .
<en> I voted in favour of the report .

<en> The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the arrest of political prisoners in Belarus .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( PL ) Today we are once again discussing breaches of fundamental human rights in Belarus .
<en> As usual in such cases , we note what it is that dictators do .
<en> Obviously dictators always battle with organised religion , because , very often , this is the biggest voice that the population has .
<en> They also always battle with the trade unions .
<en> As it happens the trade unions in Belarus are rather weak , so , from this point of view , Lukashenko could seem quite a positive figure , as he does not have anyone to fight against , since they have not yet managed to create trades unions there .
<en> In addition , dictators always fight against the opposition that wants to have democracy .
<en> However , there is one thing we should also bear in mind : we should remember that Belarus is an important neighbour for the European Union in the East and should be treated as such .
<en> We have a certain tendency to treat Russia as the only neighbour to the East and forget about the fact that Belarus should also be a partner for the EU in the East , as it is a large country with great promise .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , Mr Lukashenko 's regime in Belarus deserves to be criticised for using repressive methods , arresting political opponents , using authoritarian governing methods , censorship and isolation of the country .
<en> In addition to that , the refusal to grant entry visas prevents Members of the European Parliament and of national parliaments from seeing the situation for themselves .
<en> All this is highlighted in my Group 's motion .
<en> However , I think that our criticism of breaches of human rights must be measured by absolute criteria , rather than following a political scale of who in the world plays first fiddle at the moment .
<en> That is not right .
<en> We keep running around in circles ; we have not been able to take a step towards objectivity for millennia .
<en> The Romans were always right and their chroniclers painted it as a wrongdoing when an attacked opponent was bold enough to defend himself .
<en> Let me get back to Belarus , however .
<en> Lukashenko 's regime is first and foremost an attempt to disrespect the direction in which the Euro-Atlantic initiatives are going .
<en> Mr Lukashenko plays in his own narrow field , ignoring the fact that moderate-sized countries cannot behave like that since supranational capital will not allow it .
<en> If you do not obey , you will be isolated and the international community will support the opposition within the country .
<en> That is how it works and we all know it .
<en> Sooner or later Mr Lukashenko and his party machine will pay dearly for acting in this manner .
<en> Belarus is located in an area that is strategically important for the Unites States and for NATO .
<en> The present US Administration and the governments of some other countries would very much like Belarus to join NATO , together with Ukraine and Georgia , thereby causing damage to Russia .
<en> Our worries about human rights in Belarus would not be so intense if , in fact , the real issue was not Russia .
<en> The question is , however , whether attempts to weaken Russia help the issue of world security .
<en> I am rather afraid that such attempts may unleash powers that no one will be able to control .
<en> Russia has been suppressing them for several millennia .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , the Members of the European Parliament who are concerned with the issue of Belarus and who are monitoring the situation in Belarus are faced with contradictory information .
<en> On the one hand there is the desire that has been publicly and officially declared to normalise relations with the European Union .
<en> The opening of the representative office of the European Commission in Minsk is a symbol of this desire .
<en> On the other hand , in the same month , the police brutally attacked demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of the country 's independence .
<en> The following day the authorities sent KGB special forces to independent journalists .
<en> A month later the activists were handed down long sentences and this is not even the opposition , just people who dared to demonstrate in defence of citizens ' rights and the rights of small businesses , such as Andrei Kim or Sergei Parsukiewicz .
<en> We have also recently heard that Alexander Milinkiewicz was arrested and fined just for meeting Belarus citizens and for discussing public issues with them .
<en> Alexander Kazulin , the most important political prisoner , a prisoner of conscience in contemporary Europe , is still in prison .
<en> Speaking as the chairman of the Belarus delegation I would like to see the day when we can put forward a Resolution to the European Parliament that notes with satisfaction that changes have taken place in Belarus to make that country part of the civilised European Community .
<en> Unfortunately this will not happen today .
<en> Without any guarantees for the fundamental rights of free and democratic elections , to express one 's political opinions , freedom of the press and freedom to practise one 's religion , there is no possibility that the European Union should ever recognise the regime in Belarus as a country with which it is worth cooperating , or as a country that it is worth helping .
<en> We shall never support the policies that are practised by Alexander Lukashenko .
<en> We shall , however , support independent citizens ' groups and individual citizens from Belarus in their contacts with the European Union in the hope that one day the country will return to normality .
<sp>
<en> author . - Madam President , Belarus is a beautiful and important country with much potential for progress which can lead to enviable prosperity for its citizens .
<en> Unfortunately , vital democratic norms are presently much compromised in this country .
<en> This is mainly due to the inability of the governing authorities to come to terms with the need to respect the necessities of freedom of expression and other democratic principles .
<en> Such respect is an indispensable requirement of any non-dictatorial government .
<en> Reports coming out of Belarus of arbitrary arrests of members of civil society and opposition activists , of the use of excessive force against peaceful demonstrators and of repression of independent media journalists are evidence of practices which should , and must , be terminated immediately .
<en> We call on the Belarusian Government to see reason , to change its tactics and to choose the road of freedom and democracy rather than the road of suppression and totalitarianism , which can only lead to worsening of the conflict with its own people and with the international community .

<en> - ( PL ) Mr President , I abstained from voting on Mr Harangozó 's report .
<en> One of the aims of the European Union 's cohesion policy should be to bolster the instruments of solidarity and integration .
<en> Vulnerable groups and communities should receive our support in the fight against exclusion and inequality .
<en> This should not , however , be seen as a counter-argument to the development of urban areas , as one does not preclude the other .
<en> A territorial approach is important but does not , after all , invalidate the significance of effectiveness in cohesion policy .
<sp>
<en> - ( PL ) Mr President , the Harangozó report accepted today raises the exceptionally important problem of the impact of cohesion policy on the integration of the most threatened societies and groups .
<en> This report unambiguously stresses the need for a continuation of cohesion policy in areas that are less developed , neglected , where there are difficult farming conditions and where there is weak or outdated infrastructure .
<en> Particular support should be provided for regions and for areas where there is historical developmental retardation , where the local people are less well prepared to meet the difficult challenges of a market economy .
<en> Intra-regional differences in the level of development are very great .
<en> It is therefore necessary to create a factual image of the state of development of our regions and to use this as a basis for getting to grips with difficult areas within individual regions .
<en> We can say right now that this concerns mountainous areas and a significant proportion of rural areas .
<en> We have to put together a sustainable development process so that enclaves of weaker development or backward enclaves are not left behind or created .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I also abstained on this report .
<en> I would like to make two or three points as to why I did so .
<en> Firstly , I have struggled to believe that the founding fathers of this place , when they were laying the basis for their European Union for freedom and for freedom of movement etc. thought that the detailed policy that is set out in this report would be one of the things that would come forward in years to come .
<en> Secondly , I am not convinced that this should be done at European level - perhaps it could be at national level , but most certainly it should be at the most local of levels .
<en> Finally , I would like to wind up by saying that in my constituency the City of Leicester is an example of how local action in this field can work .
<en> Leicester is one of the most diverse cities in the United Kingdom for all sorts of different reasons - it has both rich and poor , of many different nationalities - and yet , because of individual and local action , Leicester has one of the most coherent strategies for the cohesion and integration , as we say here , of vulnerable communities and groups .
<en> It is an example to us all that local action is best , and I worry when we talk about it at an EU level .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , my comments echo those of the speaker before me .
<en> My comments are also relevant to the Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou report on poverty and social exclusion .
<en> If we take these two reports together they clearly represent a flaw in the thinking of European politicians , namely that whatever the problem appears to be , Europe is the solution .
<en> I urge all of us really concerned with the problems of vulnerable communities to look instead at local-community-led solutions and not the proposals of some distant Eurocrat or some distant Member of the European Parliament .
<en> Please look at the excellent work , for example , of the Centre for Social Justice based in London in my own constituency and led by Iain Duncan-Smith and his wonderful team , who are building an alliance of local community organisations tackling poverty and social exclusion : organisations such as the Croydon Caribbean Credit Union or the London Boxing Academy , attracting some of the most vulnerable people in society .
<en> While the issues in the report are all serious problems , we should remember that the solutions are often to be found closer to home , and for this reason I abstained on the Harangozó report .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Mr President , the sustainable development policy has no chance of succeeding unless it assumes a global dimension .
<en> The UN Millennium Declaration may call on all states to ensure policy coherence for development but developed countries do not take many practical steps in this regard .
<en> Therein lies the contradiction of the undertaking by the European Union , urging us to assess the impact of our European policies concerning the Development Goals .
<en> This makes the fact that we add restrictions to our fisheries policy for the benefit of developing countries even more valuable .
<en> I would also like to mention timber logging in West Africa , where only 5 % of forests are managed sustainably .
<en> Of course it is important for the Commission to financially support the launch of national strategic plans in Africa but we will also be able to prevent the plundering of tropical forests if we prohibit the timber from being imported into Europe unless it has a clear eco-label .
<en> I believe that the Commission will soon table such proposals and that we in this House and the Council will adopt them , without looking for any excuses .
<en> Written explanations of vote
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - President , I spoke on the Morgan report during the debate but I did not have the opportunity to speak on amendment 159 .
<en> This amendment would prohibit Member States from authorising the construction of new power stations that emit more than 350g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour produced .
<en> I would like to clarify the position on behalf of the EPLP who have all received a number of letters on this amendment .
<en> Whilst we appreciate that climate change is real and present and we have an obligation to address this , we have voted against amendment 159 because it would knock out the development of all new gas- , oil- and coal-fired power stations .
<en> This would be detrimental to Europe 's security of supply and to keeping the lights on in Europe .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted against the Morgan report and the energy package because I believe that we are going down the wrong road .
<en> The proposed Agency will be yet another bureaucratic body .
<en> A network of national regulators with extended powers would be a more effective way of ensuring that small producers have access to the networks .
<en> Unbundling has become a kind of magic potion , whereas the experience of those countries that have been practising it certainly does not put the case for liberal measures of this kind .
<en> The energy market is a global market .
<en> Competition for Gazprom and the oil-producing states will come not from the biogas cooperatives but from the big European companies .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) When it voted for compulsory unbundling of ownership of energy concerns in the European Union , the European Parliament took a decisive step towards creating a common market in electrical energy .
<en> Dividing these concerns into companies responsible for energy production and companies responsible for its transmission is the only way to create an open and competitive market where there is no conflict of interest .
<en> The consumer should be the main beneficiary of the proposed changes .
<en> The proposal adopted significantly strengthens consumers ' rights .
<en> Inter alia , it gives consumers the right to withdraw from a contract with an electricity supplier without additional charges .
<en> Consumers are also given the right to change their energy supplier in a very short time .
<en> It should be borne in mind that the electricity market is currently dominated by monopolies that abuse their position on uncompetitive markets .
<en> I believe that price caps will protect energy users from exploitation by energy concerns , without deterring new entities from entering the market .
<en> Clearly , the solutions proposed will not resolve all the problems related to energy currently confronting us , such as the rise in oil prices .
<en> Nonetheless , these solutions represent appropriate steps towards the development of a more competitive market .
<en> The debate is to continue in the Council .
<en> Unfortunately , however , it is unlikely that all of the European Parliament 's proposals will be accepted .
<en> As the rapporteur rightly pointed out , many Member States protect want to protect their own national interests .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) This third energy package dogmatically persists in following the course of total separation between the energy production side and the distribution networks .
<en> It is aimed at subjecting the entire energy sector solely to the laws of the free market and to everyone competing with everyone else .
<en> As the same causes produce the same effects this will lead the European Union to an even bigger disaster than that experienced by California in the year 2000 .
<en> This policy is bad for consumers , bad for the industry 's employees , bad for SMEs and SMIs , bad for jobs , bad for security and bad for the environment .
<en> The market and the private sector are incapable of meeting the energy needs of Europeans and of responding to the challenges of global warming and the post fossil fuel era .
<en> Their prime objective is to pay out as much as possible to their shareholders , not to act in the general interests of the nation .
<en> We need a proper internal market for energy in Europe and this will only be achieved on the basis of cooperation .
<en> The energy sector needs to be guided by coordinated public action from the Member States , not by the activities of the financial markets .
<en> The EU has to take steps to ensure that energy is recognised as a global public resource and not as just another commodity to be bought and sold .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I was disappointed that my own group 's amendment on nuclear accident liability was not adopted .
<en> Nevertheless , the final Morgan report does contain much to commend it , and I welcome the addition of references to the proposed charter on energy consumers ' rights .
<en> On balance , therefore , I was able to vote in favour of the report .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( ET ) I strongly support these amendments , as these strengthen free competition in the European Union , help keep prices at reasonable levels and at the same time allow consumers to exercise their freedom to change their electricity supplier any time wished .
<en> Furthermore this boosts cross-border electricity sharing and , with that , also protects states and consumers from sudden electricity shortages .
<en> I call for fast action in this field in eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy and burdens to enable EU electricity companies to act freely throughout the Union to strengthen free competition and to empower consumers to make conscious choices .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted against this report , which in purporting to lay down common rules for the internal market in electricity is in fact proposing to dismantle the heritage of Europe 's traditional operating networks .
<en> Separating electricity production and electricity distribution will in my view provide no additional guarantees as to the efficiency , security or accessibility of the network , particularly in the present situation of a sustained growth in global electricity demand and major uncertainty over resources .
<en> This latter factor calls for even greater structural investment in order to safeguard our supplies and promote research and innovation , a prospect that seems to be largely incompatible with the philosophy of strong competition and short-term profitability that underlies the decision to move towards the total deregulation of this sector .
<en> The ' third way ' , which is supported by the French Socialists but regrettably was not adopted , appears to be a much more sensible solution since it allows us to preserve the patrimonial integrity of Europe 's large energy groups while at the same time placing the organisation of electricity distribution in the hands of independent regulators .
<en> Nevertheless , I welcome the progress that this report represents as far as consumer protection is concerned , particularly the introduction of rules for combating energy poverty and for ensuring transparency and accessibility to information for the end user .
<sp>
<2en> Supplying electricity is not a trade but a mains service .
<2en> The service must be provided to all stakeholders without interruption and with the lowest possible impact on the environment .
<2en> This requirement is inconsistent with the risks involved in international trade by competing companies .
<2en> Electricity will continue to be a scarce and vulnerable product in the future too , certainly now that fossil fuels are running out and as global warming continues .
<2en> That is why it is good that in many EU Member States it is the State or local authorities that have developed the power stations and electricity grids .
<2en> Privatisation of these mains services is undesirable and risky .
<2en> Their sale creates new owners and a monopoly on the transmission system .
<2en> That system is a non-profit-making resource between production and sale , but ownership of it can be misused to impose a high toll on consumers and any competitors .
<2en> Fixing electricity prices through the stock market leads to consumer prices that are much higher than production costs .
<2en> The EU Member States are right to look at how these risks should be combated .
<2en> The situation varies greatly from one Member State to another .
<2en> It is best that these issues are weighed up there .
<2en> I am in favour of giving the Member States the greatest possible freedom , the third way referred to in the Glante amendment , but I am against this European directive as a whole .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Obviously the real aim of this third energy package is not security of supply , the quality of the services being provided , price affordability or the ability of consumers freely to choose their supplier but rather the permanent dismantling of what is left of the old public electricity monopolies .
<en> The determination being displayed by the Commission and by many Members of this House in wanting to impose ' patrimonial separation ' , in other words forcing ' historical ' operators like EDF to give up ownership of their network , is quite unacceptable .
<en> The activities these companies are being accused of , namely restricting competitors ' access to the network and deliberately limiting investment in infrastructure projects , have never in fact been proven .
<en> Neither is it clear how entrusting control of the network to a single operator that is not the electricity supplier can guarantee an appropriate and adequate level of investment , non-abuse of a key position or better congestion management .
<en> This is why , though we have always defended the exclusive primacy of Member States over energy affairs , which is a strategic area of too great importance to be left to the Eurocrats , we will be supporting as the lesser of two evils the ' effective separation ' solution being proposed by , among others , France and Germany .
<en> We shall also vote against those texts whose viewpoints we fundamentally reject .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) I could only vote in favour of this report .
<en> To say yes to all the forces for liberalisation of the electricity market is to say yes to a fairer , more competitive and more transparent market .
<en> However , it is not only the correctness of this report , which places the consumer at the heart of the issue , that attracts me .
<en> With increasing energy prices and a lack of competition in national markets , there is a danger of increasing the number of citizens excluded from accessing energy .
<en> I therefore agree with the social concerns expressed as , for the first time , the concept of ' fuel poverty ' has been defined , drawing attention to the importance of the Member States developing national plans which cover all citizens .
<en> Given the current situation in the national energy markets within the EU , it is unacceptable for one company to both own the electricity network and also be responsible for the transmission of electricity , thus holding a de facto monopoly , as it can then block access to the market for new operators who , in many cases , are more competitive .
<en> This document therefore courageously identifies the need to increase the level of transparency and competition within the energy sector , while effectively protecting the consumer from the consequences of a closed and inflexible market .

<en> in writing . - The fishing industry has faced many crises over the years , but none greater than at present , with rising fuel prices which are pushing the industry over the edge to the point where it can no longer survive .
<en> The continuing spiralling price of oil could prove to be disastrous for many industries , but none is more vulnerable than the fishing industry , with jobs at sea and on shore at risk .
<en> We must look into all the options which are available to us .
<en> One route that should be explored is reducing taxes in order to ensure that fuel costs come down .
<en> May I ask the following question : if we do not have fishermen , where will the fish we require come from ?
<en> Are we going to sit back and allow foreign imports to take over our markets and put our industry out of business ?
<en> Saving our fishing fleets and the industry in general will prove to be a massive challenge .
<en> However , I am confident that with good will and all-round cooperation it is possible .
<en> I welcome yesterday 's statement from the Commission announcing its intention to provide emergency assistance to fishing fleets .
<en> I sincerely hope that these measures will be formally adopted by the Council of Fisheries Ministers next week and then swiftly implemented .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) The dramatic rise in the price of diesel oil , 300 % since 2003 has made its full impact felt in the fisheries sector .
<en> With the continuously worsening crisis , many fishing undertakings are now in a very fragile financial state .
<en> Fisheries are in fact a particularly important pillar in the economic and social development of the outermost regions .
<en> Moreover , they are hit all the harder by the rise in the price of fuel because of their remote geographical location .
<en> That is an unacceptable situation .
<en> The European Union has a duty to find a compromise .
<en> The European Parliament has just sent out a strong signal to fishers .
<en> In calling for the official aid ceiling to be raised to EUR 100 000 per vessel and not per undertaking , in calling for the immediate application of emergency and social support measures and , lastly , in demanding the reorganisation of European Fund expenditure for fisheries , MEPs have made it clear to fishers that they have heard their distress call .
<en> The Council of European fisheries ministers will be discussing these proposals on 23 and 24 June 2008 .
<en> The European Union has no option but to restore the confidence of fishers in order to plug the huge hole that has recently appeared .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I would like to point out once again that there is no western company that is as closely linked with the state as Gazprom is with the Kremlin .
<en> At present we are faced with a cold political calculation .
<en> The domination of Gazprom in the energy sector will lead to another increase in energy prices in Europe .
<en> Russia will be able to force through even greater political concessions for supplies of gas and oil .
<en> We are already seeing the effects of high prices in the ever more frequent protests in Europe .
<en> We also have , fresh in our memories , the repeated closure of gas supplies to our eastern neighbours .
<en> Mr President , I supported this resolution because I believe that Europe must begin to speak with one voice in its relations with Russia , because only in this way can we guarantee that the EU will be effective .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) It is well-known that Russia is an important strategic partner for the European Union , and our geography makes us dependent on each other .
<en> Diplomacy must therefore be used to find the best solutions for this unavoidable proximity .
<en> The need to cooperate , however , must not force us into a real or disguised blindness towards the serious problems Russia raises .
<en> Internally it cannot be ignored that Russia is not a full democracy and that the rule of law does not ensure effective respect for human rights .
<en> Externally it is impossible to ignore the use of energy as a weapon in external relations , in particular by promoting EU disunity in this area , the equivocal role it has played in the Iranian issue , and its unwillingness to force China to commit itself to human rights , among others .
<en> Europe 's voice in relation to Russia must be that of a serious partner which is willing to cooperate , but which is not willing to compromise on core issues of democracy , human rights and security .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) The complex relations between the European Union and Russia require well-managed and coherent diplomatic action .
<en> The approaching EU-Russia summit arouses many emotions , as agreements are to be negotiated that are of great significance for both Russia and the European Union .
<en> Prior to this summit we must realise just how important it is for the future of the European Union that it should speak with one voice in the international arena .
<en> For this reason it is a shame that the people of Ireland put a question mark over the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in last week 's referendum , as it is precisely this Treaty that contains the regulations that will make the European Union a credible partner in international relations .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this debate is about the nuts and bolts of Parliament , and it is our duty to ask if the proposals about groups are practical .
<en> It was certainly with practicalities in mind , faced with the basic requirement of 30 Members , that I submitted my amendment - I think it was my amendment , Mr Corbett - which enabled the President of Parliament , with the agreement of the Conference of Presidents , to allow a group to continue its work for a limited period if it fell below that particular threshold .
<en> In committee it was generally agreed this was a good idea to avoid a group being held hostage by a Member threatening to leave and thereby instantly disbanding such a group .
<en> That is why I am somewhat attracted by this new compromise which has been proposed for a limit of 25 Members .
<en> It does seem to me to be a sensible idea , which would alleviate one of the difficulties I was referring to when I prepared my amendment .
<en> We must always remember , however , that we were elected to represent the views and interests of our electorate as a whole .
<en> It is a fact that our European electoral spectrum spans an ever-wider variety of opinion , which is good for democracy .
<en> It is not just the number of Members which increases in this Parliament ; it is also the diversity of views which they bring with them .
<en> If we are successfully to fulfil our parliamentary mandate , we must have the opportunity to fully mirror the views of our national electorates .
<en> A small group in the European Parliament here may well represent a large body of opinion in Member States .
<en> We need to be able to work constructively as a Parliament and also , most importantly , in line with the wishes of the people that we represent , however that is formulated in the disposition and composition of our groups .
<en> So , whilst I welcome this possible compromise , I welcome a sensible and pragmatic approach to this matter .
<en> I hope that we do not allow ourselves to fall into the trap of assuming that fewer groups necessarily means more democracy .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Mr. President , colleagues , I think that the motion in the report of Mr. Corbett deserves attention and , in my opinion , comes just on time , since actually with its adoption we do not threaten any of the currently existing groups in the European Parliament .
<en> I am in support of a more effectively functioning Parliament in the next mandate from 2009 to 2014 .
<en> We have discussed the meaning of these changes repeatedly and limitation of the opportunities of Members elected to the European parliament to express their opinion has never been discussed .
<en> But since our Parliament is a large Parliament , maybe , as we say the largest democratically elected parliament in the world , its essence of European Parliament is held precisely by the parliamentary groups , by the political groups that represent not the nations of the elected Members who participate in them , but represent the political trends which unite the Members .
<en> This is also the meaning of the great power , opportunities which both the political groups and their leaders have in the activity of our Parliament .
<en> That is why I think that now , too , should we blunder in the direction of blaming Socialists or Christian Democrats of being undemocratic , we will not be right .
<en> Quite the contrary , I think that in this way we shall provide the opportunity for a much clearer profile of the political groups which manage to form and actually operate in the next mandate of the European Parliament .
<en> Of course , I also think that it is easy to speak in the name of a political group which is not threatened with failure to come up with the necessary number of Members in the next parliament .
<en> I think that in any case the groups that exist today will be able to continue to exist over the next mandate .
<en> In addition , our presence here , in this Parliament , is largely due to the power of the political parties we represent .
<en> We should not consider the one in isolation from the other .
<en> That is why we should not think , either , that the political life of Europe unconditionally revolves here , in Parliament , and depends on the two political groups , nor should we forget the parties we represent .
<en> And in this sense I suggest that we really move toward the suggested compromise and support the motion of Mr. Corbett .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , this Parliament frequently talks about openness , transparency and democracy , but does not always display it .
<en> In this instance , the rapporteur , Mr Corbett , has been very open and transparent about what he seeks to achieve : he wants to make it harder for small groups to form and function ; he wants to deny them the resources and privileges they are currently entitled to , which enables them to represent the will of those who elected them .
<en> Mr Corbett wants to put political groups that he does not approve of out of business if he possibly can .
<en> This is totally undemocratic .
<en> Why should not the will of European electors be expressed in political groups , formed by those they elect , however small those groups may be .
<en> Why not ?
<en> Because Mr Corbett does not think they should be allowed to !
<en> These rules , if adopted , would , for example , put my own - the Independence and Democracy Group - out of business .
<en> The IND / DEM Group was , of course , formed to oppose the European Constitution , and we have been very successful , having spent money on the ' no ' campaigns in the French , Dutch and , most recently , Irish , referendums .
<en> That is why Mr Corbett and other Europhiles want to try to put us , and any group like us elected after 2009 , out of action if they can .
<en> His totally undemocratic credentials are transparent for all to see .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , Parliament needs to interpret Democracy in a democratic fashion .
<en> This means that the Rules of Procedure should not be taken in isolation ; rather they must be interpreted in the light of the moral basis for suffrage and the principle of representation as signifying self-legislation and citizens ' autonomy .
<en> Drawing some points from this principle , I should like to say the following : from my point of view , the amendment Mr Corbett has proposed is correct in principle , but the reason why a group that falls below the minimum threshold necessary during a parliamentary term must continue to exist lies especially in the fact that voters ' democratic choices are also nearly always made taking account of the EP political group that candidates belong to .
<en> Voters are not indifferent to whether a candidate is elected to sit on the benches of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament or of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
<en> This being the case , I believe that this amendment , rather than containing a discretionary power for the President of Parliament , should contain a binding power , rather than a permission , a duty , and the period for continuation of the group can only , from a democratic point of view , be exactly the period of a parliamentary term .
<en> Otherwise we would be completely subverting the principles of freedom that make up what we are .
<en> My second remark concerns the temptation to copy what the national parliaments do .
<en> National parliaments really do act as models for us , but in this case we need to copy them cum grano salis , with caution , as the proliferation of groups in European democracy can make up for the lack of representativity that hurls Europe from one crisis to another .
<en> Proliferation here may make up for the persistent divorce between European citizens and those who represent them .
<en> Additionally , the more plurality there is , the more evident the struggle and intense politicking that normally lead to our consensuses will become , as systematic consensuses are not free from controversy here either .
<en> Having many groups can help Parliament politicise bureaucratic Europe , because a Democracy is a Democracy and not an Order .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we should not direct any additional financial support towards Members and representatives who argue against democracy at the European level .
<chp>

<en> ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , even though today 's discussion focuses , naturally , on the internal energy market , I would like , in the interest of balance , to refer to the great importance of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan with regard to Europe 's ability to deal with the enormous challenges it is currently facing in the areas of energy and the environment .
<en> We need to review our priorities , but we also need to redefine our current development model , to follow a course with low or zero carbon emissions , while at the same time creating development opportunities for European industry , which has the capability to lead the rapidly developing sector of low and zero carbon emissions technology .
<en> Increasing the EU budget for research in the energy sector and promoting innovation in sectors such as renewable energy sources and intelligent networks are absolutely necessary in order to deal with today 's challenges .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues , especially Jerzy Buzek for his report .
<en> As Aristotle said , ' well begun is half done ' .
<en> Actually beginning rather than encouraging a set of salutary objectives will thus be a fundamental step in laying the foundations of the vital commitment to combat climate change .
<en> This pressing challenge requires a new definition of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan based on two redefined pillars : ensuring better , cleaner production with regard to CO2 emissions through innovative technologies ; and using less by decreasing energy use in all its forms and by promoting all the solutions .
<en> This basic good sense is unfortunately not sufficiently recognised in our major policies and measures to reduce energy use are not given adequate support in the SET-Plan or in the EU 's major structural policies .
<en> Another crucial element is the urgent need to increase both the human and financial resources needed to actually achieve our European goals .
<en> When will we at last provide a concrete response to the crucial demand , the formidable challenge represented by climate change ?
<en> We are lagging behind when it comes to financing research on low-carbon technologies .
<en> To use Aristotle 's words again , Mr President , if we begin to provide extensive funding for research into these technologies , we will already have won half the battle in this new world .
<en> We will have complete energy efficiency and , in no time , exceptional energy efficiency .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) The Union needs a common energy policy .
<en> Priority projects , such as Nabucco , acknowledged by the European Council as well , will diversify the European Union 's natural gas supply sources and they must be achieved .
<en> Regional cooperation is essential for ensuring the Union 's energy supply .
<en> This is why I consider and I requested by means of an amendment that the geographic area covered by each regional cooperation structure be defined by the Commission only after consultation with the Member States in the given geographic area .
<en> For this reason , I requested by means of an amendment that , for any project of natural gas pipelines crossing the seas bordering the Union , the Commission and the Member States involved conduct an environmental impact study .
<en> I consider it essential that the public service obligations and the minimum common standards resulting thereof be better consolidated in order to guarantee the fact that the gas services can be accessible to the population and small and medium-sized enterprises .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) Today , we debate on three important reports for the European Union energy policy , reports that contain references to the energy technology , energy safety and fighting energy poverty as essential factors for achieving the objectives regarding energy and climate change .
<en> Our colleague Paparizov 's report defines a new concept of access to the natural gas transportation networks ; colleague La Russa 's report brings an important contribution to defining the medium and long-term strategy of the internal natural gas market , and colleague Buzek 's report emphasizes the need to develop the strategic energy technologies .
<en> The rapid implementation of these reports will develop a more efficient and transparent internal market with direct effects in increasing competitiveness , transparency of prices at the end user and protection of consumer rights .
<en> Today , it is time that the Commission and the Council explicitly and concretely encourage the diversification of supply sources and the development of new gas storage facilities in order to ensure the Union 's energy independence and safety .
<en> In the end , I would like to congratulate our three colleagues for the manner in which they have managed the drafting of reports .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , the purpose of the regulations we are discussing today is to make it easier to integrate the gas markets of individual markets and to increase executive monitoring at a European level .
<en> The gas market should be considered separately from the electricity market because of the European Union 's considerable dependence on imports .
<en> Ownership unbundling could be an extremely useful instrument for guaranteeing the creation of a unified gas market in the European Union and for the creation of real competition in the EU energy market and , in practice , could lead to a reduction , or at least a stabilisation , of energy prices .
<en> However , we should also be cautious .
<en> The liberalisation process requires concrete structural changes , for which not all European Union countries are prepared .
<en> Market liberalisation and ownership unbundling just in Poland , without this happening throughout all the main energy producers in the EU , could give West European firms an advantage over Poland .
<en> Europe needs an energy model that does not just ensure that there is competition in regional markets and in the common European market , but also guarantees protection for the end user , and , first and foremost , guarantees energy security .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I support the Olympic Games being held in Beijing , but I also urge the European governments and institutions to demand that China abide by its commitments regarding human rights , namely those undertaken in order to have the Olympic Games in Beijing .
<en> This requires that the European representatives who will - or will not - be attending the Olympic Games use this opportunity to draw attention to the situation of human rights in China .
<en> It is very serious .
<en> There are many people in jail , including Hu Jia , who was jailed after speaking to us here in the European Parliament via a video-conference .
<en> We cannot accept that these people will continue to be kept in jail for no account by the Chinese authorities .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , many countries and their leaders , including those in Europe , are keen to have good contacts with China in order to obtain lucrative contract or economic agreements , paying scant attention to the lack of democracy and the failure to respect human rights in China .
<en> World opinion , world leaders and global institutions should act together and should apply various types of pressure in defence of such values as freedom , human rights and democracy .
<en> If we are divided then we will not be able to act together and we will have little effect .
<en> The Olympic Games are a good opportunity for such measures .
<en> The international community should act to help a population that has suffered as a result of the tragic earthquake .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly , it was not the European Union which decided , back in 2001 , that the Olympic Games should be held in Beijing ; it was the International Olympic Committee .
<en> Secondly , as you have said , the Olympic ideals do exist , but they are not about politics , they are about sports , something that the International Olympic Committee is saying over and over again .
<en> Thirdly , I do not know if the best way to fight for human rights in China and to have a comprehensive dialogue is to ease one 's conscience by saying ' I 'm not going to go , but I 'll still watch the opening ceremony on television ' , as a Member said just now .
<en> I do not think that the problem really revolves around this issue .
<en> I note , moreover , that a number of Members from various political groups and of varying persuasions have also expressed their views in your House on the dialogue that we should have with the Chinese authorities .
<en> Whatever the current difficulties , we must continue to make the most of the EU 's relations with China .
<en> Only a strong Union will enable the two sides to conduct open discussions - that we all have been advocating - on any issue , even those that appear to be the thorniest ; the European Union did not wait for the events to take place in Tibet to initiate such a dialogue .
<en> We want to establish dialogue with China on an increasing number of issues of bilateral and global concern that are not purely commercial - it is a gross misrepresentation to suggest otherwise .
<en> This point was also made by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner .
<en> We need a comprehensive dialogue with China because that country has an important role to play in the international community , and we must do everything we can - the Olympic Games are also a means to that end - to ensure that China is more effectively integrated into the international community .
<en> In addition , I should like to point out that we shall have to hold strategic dialogue with China , particularly at the forthcoming summit to be held under the French Presidency .
<en> It was not the French Presidency which selected the date for this summit .
<en> The summit will take place in the second half of 2008 .
<en> It falls to us to ensure that preparations are made in the best possible circumstances , and this summit should provide an opportunity for the partnership between China and the European Union to address new issues , in particular those relating to action against climate change and to environmental and social standards - as many of you have said .
<en> China 's determination to play a more important role in the international arena must be accompanied by new responsibilities in the field of human rights , in the social sphere and in relation to environmental protection .
<en> We are aware of that and we are prepared to work towards that goal , and the European Union is undoubtedly the most suitable partner to help China follow this path .
<en> In this respect , after having consulted his colleagues and counterparts and received their consent , President Sarkozy , in his capacity as President of the European Union , assumes the responsibilities of engaging in a comprehensive dialogue between the European Union and China .
<en> If China wishes to play a bigger role on the world stage , it must shoulder the resultant responsibilities .
<en> Many comparisons have been made , for example by Mr Cohn-Bendit .
<en> I noted the comparison with the USSR of Brezhnev .
<en> Do we really want a conflict between two antagonistic blocs ?
<en> Was not some progress made in the dialogue that has also been made with this great country ?
<en> We played a key role in achieving this progress , and it is also through dialogue and through democratic developments that our values prevailed , as always .
<en> We must have a challenging dialogue with China where no subject is taboo , and we must encourage it to make commitments in all areas , in the political , human rights and social fields .
<en> Indeed , some Members have mentioned the death penalty .
<en> We should also address this issue with China , but we must also address it with all the other countries , and I hope that the same conservative Members who have spoken just now on the subject will do so .
<en> I should like to remind you that there are other countries where the death penalty is in force that have relations with the European Union ; however , we do need to have this comprehensive dialogue .
<en> We must also proceed with caution , and I am in full agreement with what the Commission said with regard to the Council , that we should not exacerbate nationalist feelings in China at a time when it is playing host to a very important event for the whole country , a country which is seeking to achieve its integration into the international arena .
<en> It is in that spirit , assuming all the responsibilities that are associated with his role and acting in full awareness of the nature of European values , that President Sarkozy , in his new role , will visit Beijing to convey this message and also to demonstrate that we have faith in the positive development of this great country with regard to its integration into the international arena .
<en> We have already seen tangible signs of progress in Burma and in the resolution of conflicts with Iran and with North Korea ; these are all areas where we also need China 's assistance .
<en> This clearly involves much more than purely commercial interests .
<en> Finally , I would say to Mr Cappato that , in all our relations , whether within the EU , with regard to minorities , or in relations between the Union and some of its partners , we must also have the same requirements and be careful before giving the whole world lessons in morality .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I shall be very brief because much has been said .
<en> I would just like to reiterate that the relationship with China is a very multifaceted one .
<en> That means that we have huge scope in this strategic relationship .
<en> Apart from the environment , trade , culture - whatever the various sectoral talks and dialogues that we have - we also take the concerns with regard to human rights that have been particularly expressed here today very seriously .
<en> We take them seriously whether they concern human rights defenders or petitioners who are in jail or the application of the death penalty .
<en> It is true that very high numbers of people are being executed .
<en> We have always mentioned this very clearly , also the alleged cases of torture and ill-treatment .
<en> We have this human rights dialogue .
<en> It is true that sometimes it is not satisfactory , but we do not have another instrument .
<en> We have to continue having a dialogue with China .
<en> We have a saying in German : Steter Tropfen höhlt den Stein ( Constant dripping wears the stone ) .
<en> This is what we are trying to do .
<en> ( Applause )
<sp>
<en> To close this debate , five proposals for a resolution have been submitted in accordance with Article 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m. , by way of exception , due to the presentation of the programme for the French Presidency .
<en> Written statements ( Article 142 of the Rules of Procedure )
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SK ) The Olympic Games in Beijing are approaching but , according to my information , the human rights ' situation in China has not improved .
<en> Rather , on the contrary , the Chinese regime keeps arresting more and more people in order to prevent potential demonstrations during the Olympic Games .
<en> Press freedom is extremely important because the independent media are the ones that provide uncensored information on the human rights ' situation in China .
<en> Therefore it is vital that independent TV stations , such as NTDTV , can also broadcast .
<en> This TV station broadcasts 24 / 7 in Chinese and English via satellites over Asia , Europe , Australia and North America .
<en> The French company Eutelsat that transmits NTDTV suddenly stopped NTDTV 's signal over Asia on 16 June 2008 , apparently because of the pressure applied by the Communist Party of China .
<en> Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , I appeal to you in the hope that you will use , in the name of the Commission , all possible means to restore NTDTV broadcasts over Asia .
<en> I also call on the French Presidency to prevent , in the name of the Council , the restrictions on freedom of speech in China .
<en> I call on the Chinese authorities to show the world that the fact that the Olympic Games were given to Beijing has resulted in an improved human rights ' situation in China .
<en> I believe that opening Tibet to tourists , journalists and all media will be for real and will allow uncensored information to be provided about the situation in this area .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( HU ) Enlargement is one of the EU 's most successful policies , and at the same time perhaps one of the most effective instruments of external policy ever known .
<en> Every enlargement up to now has strengthened the Union , and has stabilised and generally aligned the countries that have acceded .
<en> The four years that have passed since the enlargement of 2004 have put to rest all the unfounded fears and misleading information that preceded it : the enlargement is an overwhelming success , and both old and new have gained a great deal from it .
<en> Unfortunately , some politicians , either consciously or from sheer stupidity , deny the success of the enlargement and mislead citizens in the old Member States .
<en> It is therefore of paramount importance that we acquaint society with the advantages and benefits of enlargement .
<en> The rejection of the Lisbon Treaty by Ireland really is a major barrier to further enlargement of the Union .
<en> I still trust that the EU will quickly find a solution in order to save the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> However , Croatia 's admission should not be held hostage : the accession of Croatia is legally possible even without Lisbon coming to life .
<en> Croatia could therefore become a member at the end of 2009 or the start of 2010 , depending on the progress of the accession negotiations .
<en> The relationship between enlargement strategy and the European Neighbourhood Policy is a complicated question .
<en> I basically agree that our European neighbours who do not yet have the prospect of membership should move from one category to the other according to their fulfilment of measurable objectives .
<en> At the same time , it is important that the Union be able to protect its geopolitical area of freedom of movement and , with regard to integration capacity , it should itself decide in some specific cases what prospects to offer its partners .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats abstained in the vote on the Brok report .
<en> We want to clarify our position on the future enlargement of the EU in this explanation of vote .
<en> We think that the Copenhagen criteria are the only requirements which can be imposed on candidate countries negotiating for EU membership .
<en> We are in favour of the continued enlargement of the EU and consider it to be one of the great issues for the future of the Union .
<en> We also consider that the negotiations with Turkey must continue and that the country must be assessed against the same objective criteria as other candidate countries .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Madam President , Mr Brok 's report underscores the desire to improve our relationships with the East , and that is why I supported it .
<en> I think , though , that this report is not very expressive , and that it lacks the clear plan for the opening up of the European Union to the East that we were hoping for .
<en> We expected a better drafted document from the former Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) Mr. President , appreciating the complexity and punctual usefulness of the Commission 's 2007 enlargement strategy paper , we consider that , in the new context determined by the Irish people 's vote , at least the internal dimension of the enlargement strategy should become the subject of more applied debates again .
<en> The Union 's capacity to accomplish the objectives of its policies and achieve a functional regional cooperation , especially in the countries of South-Eastern Europe , depends on the manner in which the intra-Community relations shall settle .
<en> I would like to emphasize the fact that any negotiation formula introducing differentiated treatments for another Member State , no matter the reasons invoked , will initiate a " chain of weaknesses ” and I do not believe such an approach could bring benefits in the long term .
<en> The success of our future actions depends on the manner in which we will know to explain to the public opinion the direct impact and long-term advantages of enlargement .
<en> I could even say that we should look at the Irish vote from a constructive perspective : this vote is the proof of the fact that we have not always known to be open partners of the simple citizen , who is rather the subject of efficient political practices than the defender of ideas and visionary concepts .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the Brok report on the strategy for future enlargements of the EU in order to reaffirm my belief that no further enlargement will be possible without a new treaty allowing the Union to work with 27 Member States or more , accompanied by an adequate financial framework .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I understand from Mr Brok 's report on enlargement that any new accession can succeed only if , and I quote , ' there is clear and long-lasting public support ' .
<2en> This sentence seems completely hypocritical , coming just days after the scornful reaction of the Eurocracy to the clear ' no ' of the Irish to the Lisbon Treaty , which simply echoes the French and Dutch ' no ' of 2005 .
<2en> It also follows the replacement , in the French Constitution , of the compulsory referendum on EU accession by a pseudo-referendum based on ' popular initiative ' , which in actual fact depends on the goodwill of the French Assembly and Senate .
<2en> Admittedly , Mr Brok , in the knowledge that the vast majority of Europeans are opposed to Turkey joining the EU , does not even mention public consultation by referendum .
<2en> To win the support he describes , he simply proposes good old propaganda for a public considered ignorant or even simple-minded .
<2en> If Mr Brok and his European and national counterparts fear - or despise - the public so much , they should at least have the decency to stop seeking its approval .
<2en> European democracy would certainly be all the stronger for it .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Mr President , I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council to say : I was looking forward to your speech today with particular interest .
<en> Your position today has convinced me that you will make waves during the six months of your Presidency .
<en> The whole world is faced with one of the gravest economic crises in recent decades , but Europe is also facing its own crises .
<en> It is obvious that today the Europe of 27 cannot operate according to the rules of the Europe of 15 .
<en> This is the institutional crisis that Europe is going through .
<en> It is also obvious that today some Member States do not want political unification for Europe , and do not want our predecessors ' vision to be realised .
<en> This is a crisis of identity .
<en> The institutional crisis will be solved , but how can the identity crisis be solved ?
<en> I am afraid there is only one solution : the Member States that want political harmonisation should advance , and the Member States that see Europe only as an economic union should stay behind .
<en> Indeed , I am afraid that if we do not go ahead with this solution , Europe will at some point cease to be a player on the international chessboard .
<en> Crises can lead to great leaps forward , but only if the necessary courage is there .
<en> I believe you have both vision and courage .
<en> Be courageous !
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , your basic orientation has my full support .
<en> I believe you are the right President-in-Office at an extremely sensitive time , with the necessary sensitivity to people 's concerns and the determination to lead and reconcile .
<en> When you were answering the questions , you did not pass the buck , and you called a spade a spade .
<en> You do not run away , but face up to things .
<en> I should particularly like to emphasise your strong commitment to parliamentary democracy .
<en> This commitment is particularly important in these times because , in several Member States - including my home country , Austria - we have been experiencing the playing off of direct democracy against parliamentary democracy and thus the incapacitation in European matters of parliaments in parliamentary democracies .
<en> Let us stand together for parliamentary democracy and against its incapacitation .
<en> ( Applause )
<en> It is also important to me that you have directly addressed the cowardice or , it could be said , the double standards , of many governments and members of governments in relation to their shared European responsibilities , as these double standards are one of the main causes of the lack of trust and mutual finger-pointing to which we must put a stop .
<en> We do not require everyone to be bolder , but we do require everyone to be honest and principled .
<en> I should like to touch on three more issues .
<en> The first is your position on the Treaty .
<en> You are not like a rabbit caught in the headlights , you are not waiting for Ireland , but are continuing the ratification process whilst approaching Ireland .
<en> I firmly believe that we shall come to an arrangement with Ireland only after all the other 26 Member States have ratified the Treaty .
<en> However , we must not leave Croatia out on its own .
<en> I welcome your commitment to opening all the chapters by the end of the year .
<en> We also need a timetable for Macedonia .
<en> I would ask the Council to also take a decision on the Small Business Act at its December Summit , as the main competences lie with the Member States .
<en> We need legal binding and not just another public political statement .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I have some good news from Poland .
<en> Today , Mr President , a debate is being held in the Polish Parliament that will culminate in a resolution urging the Polish President to fulfil his constitutional duty and sign the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> This is the will of the Polish people , 80 % of whom support the European Union and are very happy to be a member .
<en> Show me another state in which support for the EU is so high .
<en> This is a signal that Poland will discharge its obligations with regard to the Treaty .
<en> On another subject : I have a request for you , Mr President .
<en> Could you see your way to putting the situation of children in the European Union on the agenda and appointing an ombudsman , an attorney for children 's affairs , on the model of the European Human Rights Ombudsman ?
<en> We would like the Council to come to an agreement and accept this institution that Europe is so in need of .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if I were to summarise this morning 's debate , I would say that it is good that France holds the Presidency at this time , and good that you , President Sarkozy , occupy the position of President-in-Office of the Council .
<en> This has been a good day for Europe and for this Parliament , as for the first time in a long time we again have before us somebody who speaks for Europe with passion , not just with good arguments .
<en> Perhaps that is just what we need to win over the Irish and to win back our citizens : passion and good judgement , and good judgement includes Europe confining itself to certain limits .
<en> I should like to give you the ' secret of success ' : we need not only the Treaty in Ireland , but also a new culture of subsidiarity .
<en> We need boundaries for Europe in relation to the rest of the world , but we also need boundaries within Europe .
<en> A new culture of subsidiarity will bring renewed approval to Europe ; I am in total agreement with President Barroso on that .
<en> Good luck , President Sarkozy .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I welcome President Sarkozy to the European Parliament .
<en> I certainly appreciated his considered and well-argued contribution .
<en> As an Irish member I will also welcome him when he visits Ireland as President of the EU , as a President who is taking practical steps to improve the lives of citizens .
<en> That was clear from his priorities .
<en> I also appreciate his comments on food security and about finding a balance when imposing regulations and restrictions on our own businesses and farmers .
<en> As he said himself , protecting without protectionism .
<en> I could hear in his presentation and in his voice his commitment to Europe .
<en> I and very many Irish people share that commitment .
<en> He spoke about overcoming our difficulties .
<en> That will take time and a willingness to compromise on all sides .
<en> There can be no deadlines .
<en> As somebody who canvassed for a ' yes ' vote , I know he will agree with me when I say that an Irish ' no ' is just as legitimate as a French , Dutch or Danish ' no ' .
<en> It must be given the same respect , then we can move forward .
<en> We can make progress .
<en> I look forward to that , and I wish him well in his presidency .

<en> The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in Bangladesh .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( PL ) Mr President , in connection with the disturbances in January 2007 , the caretaker government in Bangladesh introduced a state of emergency , and on 11 June this year it passed a new regulation limiting human rights through an imprecise definition of a terrorist act .
<en> In June there was a mass wave of arrests in Bangladesh , taking advantage of extraordinary powers enabling arrests to be made without a warrant when a link between the person being arrested and criminal offences can be presumed .
<en> In fact , the arrests concerned leaders , members and sympathisers of the two main opposition groups , the Awami League and the Bangladesh People 's Party , who were refusing to cooperate with the government in organising general elections until their leaders were released from captivity .
<en> Today 's incipient negotiations with the Awami League are cause for hope .
<en> The massive rise in food prices is threatening the stability of the country , however .
<en> Under these conditions , the elections planned for December are no guarantee that Bangladesh is setting off down the road of democracy .
<en> We call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights , which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections .
<en> We call for the armed forces to be withdrawn from actions linked to the organisation of the elections .
<sp>
<en> author . - Mr President , as we know , Parliament has been concerned about the situation in Bangladesh for a considerable period of time .
<en> We supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections .
<en> I think it is important to say that we very much welcome the progress that has been made on that new electronic register .
<en> It is a major task which has been undertaken and indeed , if it is fulfilled in time and ensures that minority groups etc. are also included on it , this will really be an historic achievement by the Bangladeshi authorities .
<en> We know that the electoral register has also had a very positive effect already , certainly for a number of women from poorer families and backgrounds , who feel that at last they have an identity , that they can now borrow small amounts of money to set up their own businesses etc .
<en> So there have been some positive moves .
<en> We also welcome recent action on war criminals and the action that the government , or at least some of it , has taken against corruption .
<en> But we have major concerns about the role and activity of the continuing interim government and the state of emergency .
<en> There are some who have said that the state of emergency is a technical issue , as it were , to ensure that a government can at least continue beyond the caretaker period .
<en> But whether one agrees with that or not , I think that what is happening with the state of emergency is really beginning to reflect a clear lack of checks and balances within the system there , particularly given the reports , as we have just been hearing , of mass arrests , the lack of due process , the allegations of torture , reports of extrajudicial killings , pressure on journalists and increasing violence against women .
<en> So there is a clear need for the interim government to rein in the security forces , to cease the mass arrests and to proceed to either charge or release those people arrested and to ensure due process .
<en> Certainly this resolution reflects the wish which I think is there in Parliament to lift the state of emergency and to ensure that civil society can proceed to full , fair , free elections with the support of the European Union , at any rate in its electoral monitoring capacity .
<sp>
<en> author . - Mr President , Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries on the planet and one whose physical integrity has an expiry date since , if the curse of global warming is not stopped , much of the country will be submerged under the sea by 2050 .
<en> The state of emergency , with all its anti-democratic manifestations - a state which was declared by the caretaker government set up in January 2007 amid violence in the run-up to the election - should have been lifted by now .
<en> All individuals held under emergency power rules should either be brought before a court of justice or be released .
<en> Furthermore , the new anti-terrorist ordinance must be urgently brought into line with internationally accepted standards , safeguarding personal rights and freedoms .
<en> In addition , the country 's armed forces must terminate their involvement in the political processes of the country and the forthcoming elections must be held in a climate of non-militarised political tranquility .
<sp>
<en> author . - ( FI ) Mr President , in the resolution which we have just adopted , the European Parliament demanded human rights for the people of India .
<en> The situation in Bangladesh is very problematic .
<en> The whole country has been in a state of emergency for 18 months and there are no free elections on the horizon .
<en> Bangladesh is not a democratic state , but of course the world is full of undemocratic states and violations of democracy .
<en> Of all the undemocratic states only Zimbabwe has received the condemnation of the EU and the United States .
<en> The undemocratic nature of its elections can be freely criticised in the western media because the country has no oil .
<en> Oil is a protective buffer against condemnations of violations of democracy .
<en> Bangladesh is not an oil state either .
<en> For that reason the media could highlight the situation in the country with the silent blessing of the oil-dependent ruling powers .
<en> Bangladesh has re-introduced the death penalty and following the declaration of the state of emergency 300 000 people were arrested on flimsy grounds , 12 000 of whom have died in the last month .
<en> Several of the people arrested in recent weeks were defenders of democracy , active local members of political parties and supporters of democracy whom the state and the government regard as criminals .
<en> Terrorism is the word of the day in Bangladesh too , and is the guise for violations of human rights .
<en> Bangladesh is not a state based on the rule of law .
<en> Human rights violations are carried out there in the form of detentions of the most varied kinds , shortcomings in the defendant 's rights of defence , and defects in both the publication of judgments and in the grounds on which they are based .
<en> The human rights enshrined in the constitution are not respected .
<en> For those reasons we call on Parliament to support the joint resolution demanding the immediate abrogation of the state of emergency and the holding of free elections in due course .

<en> in writing . - I was able to support the De Rossa report and hope that the Commission fully takes on board the Ombudsman 's recommendations in relation to the rule of law and the principle of good administration .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues are fully supportive of the principle of equality of opportunity between women and men .
<en> We agree with some aspects of this report such as : the need to make greater progress on dealing with the pay gap between women and men ; the promotion of entrepreneurship among women ; the importance of policies at national level that seeks to promote an improving work-life balance .
<en> As our Shadow Minister for Women has said : " A Conservative approach to gender equality will be based upon a belief in equality of opportunity and equitable legal , commercial , social and political treatment " .
<en> However , we are concerned by certain aspects of the report such as : the call for new legal bases in EU law and the request for a decision on the " full communitarisation of policies " .
<en> Also , we cannot support the creation of a costly " European Institute for Gender Equality " as set out in the report ; such matters must be for individual Member States to pursue .
<en> For these reasons , we have decided to abstain on this report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution based on the report by my Spanish fellow Member Mrs García Pérez on equality between men and women .
<en> More than ever we need to attend to the double dimension of the subject : on the one hand , ensuring equality in all policy areas ( gender mainstreaming ) and , on the other hand , introducing targeted measures to curb discrimination against women , including awareness-raising campaigns , the exchange of best practice , dialogue with citizens and public-private partnership initiatives .
<en> All subjects are important : unequal pay , participation in decision-making , particularly public decisions , the reconciliation of private and professional life , and violence against women .
<en> Gender equality is an important cause , for which much has already been done , but it must receive the full attention of the humanist political forces for progress and must be debated everywhere , including in intercultural dialogue .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) There are sometimes fortunate , perhaps even amusing , coincidences .
<en> Indeed , we are taking the opportunity given to us by this annual report on equality between men and women , coming at the same time as the French Presidency of the European Union , to highlight a marginal but entertaining point which is at worst a lack of tact and at best a perfect application of the principle of equality between women and men , which means not discriminating between them .
<en> A few days ago , on the occasion of the start of Mr Sarkozy 's Presidency , which received such a lot of media attention , MEPs were given gifts .
<en> In the free document wallet , notably there was a tie .
<en> Of the 785 MEPs , nearly a third are women .
<en> Were they not entitled to a small personalised gift too , or are we supposed to conclude from this that women also have to wear ties ?
<en> It still seems to be the case that , when big debates are taking place on the role and position of women in political life , boorish behaviour very often still gets the better of courteousness .
<sp>
<2en> We cannot vote in favour of the Report on Equality between women and men - 2008 , because it is trying to persuade women that settling for flexible labour relations and the reduction and commercialisation of whatever social benefits remain for the working-class family is a necessary evil , so that women will adapt to the EU policy of reconciliation of family obligations and professional engagements .
<2en> The valid findings on the pay gap between men and women are not being addressed , let alone eliminated ; instead , there are mere exhortations or the instituting of an International Equal Pay Day .
<2en> The measures proposed to combat gender stereotypes and for equal representation in decision-making , elimination of every kind of gender-based violence , etc. are a move in the right direction but will remain wishful thinking as long as the root cause responsible for these conditions and maintaining them remains , namely the capitalist system , which generates and aggravates discrimination and inequality .
<2en> True equality requires a struggle for a change in the balance of power .
<2en> Such a policy favours the workers and abolition of the EU strategy .
<2en> There should also be a fight against the profiteering of capital and the unaccountability of employers .
<2en> No measure will be effective unless the popular movement in each country is strengthened and targets are set for substantial change , right up to the level where power is exercised .

<en> ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the failure of the fifth MDG affects us all , in that it epitomises our failure to move forward with the emancipation of women all over the world .
<en> We agree that it should be made a major political objective because it also lies heavy on our consciences .
<en> However , we should also have the courage to say that thousands of women are also the victims of ignorance , neglect and misinformation .
<en> Neglect because the majority of the 500 000 cases of maternal mortality could be avoided through prevention and basic healthcare .
<en> Distributing impregnated mosquito nets , for example , could prevent fatal cases of malaria for thousands of women .
<en> Ignorance , in that all too often , girls and women are still prevented from gaining a basic education , which would simply enable them to read and understand simple health and hygiene recommendations .
<en> Lastly , misinformation : a certain conservative idea of religion and tradition , which still keeps women in a state of intolerable dependence , marriage when very young , pregnancies in close succession , and taboos over female contraception .
<en> Consequently we are taking action ; networks of parliamentary representatives for the developing population , from Europe and Africa , are working together within the UNFPA .
<en> We are speaking out in favour of health , reproduction and women 's control over their fertility and , in addition to the necessary financial support for this , we have to change attitudes and the position of women .
<en> This is a key political goal for the development of all these countries .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) I congratulate you on your opinion , Commissioner .
<en> There are many problems to which the problem of mothers ' health belongs .
<en> On the one hand , this is the system of health care , on the other hand are the social systems , related to care for motherhood in general .
<en> The health , mental and physical condition of not only the mothers but the children as well depends on the manner in which these two systems are synchronized .
<en> In the third place , motherhood is indelibly related to the demographic problems of each country and it is generally known that this is a grave problem .
<en> Part of the problems of mothers ' health are related to financing .
<en> The countries should be called upon to set aside sufficient funds , while those that cannot receive aid so that the death rate among new mothers and children could be reduced and the necessary prophylactics could be applied , for every life is a gift , and provisions should be made for a maximum number of health services and social services for women .
<en> The protection of motherhood also depends on the remuneration of the medical staff in maternity wards .
<en> This is a problem which exists in many countries , including in European Union countries , and one that has to be resolved .
<sp>
<en> ( LT ) The European Parliament has begun discussions on the Commission 's incentive to attract highly qualified specialists from third countries to the EU labour market - the so-called Blue Card .
<en> The Member States are asked not to drain skilled workers from the sensitive sectors of developing countries - education and healthcare - although some Member States , including the UK , are not prepared to do this .
<en> Talk about giving with one hand and taking away with the other !
<en> If we drain specialists from the healthcare sector , short-staffed as it is , women 's health , the health of all members of society in general , will be endangered and in an even worse state .
<en> I would like to suggest that we ensure that the legal acts we are adopting do not contradict each other and that our policies are consistent with our principles .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I intervene in this debate first of all to thank the Council for its June action plan , but more particularly to welcome the very forthright statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner .
<en> It is shocking and scandalous that this Millennium Development Goal is failing and that we have made no progress since 2000 and no progress over the last 20 years .
<en> Millions of women have died and tens of millions of children have been orphaned needlessly .
<en> We know what is causing the deaths and we know how to prevent the deaths .
<en> We have the resources , and indeed the knowledge to prevent them , and yet it is not happening .
<en> Why ?
<en> Why are we failing ?
<en> It seems to me that we are allowing the conscientious objectors to block progress on these issues .
<en> We have to push past the conscientious objectors - those who reduce this issue constantly to the issue of abortion and the provision of condoms .
<en> Why anyone should see a condom as some kind of evil instrument boggles the mind and boggles reason !
<en> I would urge those who are in a position to make decisions , and to pursue decisions , to ignore the conscientious objectors and get on with it .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , just a little reflection on this issue that has political , psychological , physical and moral aspects and so is very complicated .
<en> When Mrs Kinnock says that this side does not like even the term ' service ' , I would object .
<en> There are so many ' services ' but among them there is one which is very controversial : abortion .
<en> I think the side to my right wants to cover it with some very beautiful semantics , using terms like ' reproductive health ' .
<en> I think you know the position of most of that side of the House , but there are so many other ' services ' that you want to approve , use and support as much as is financially possible , and this will , I hope , diminish the ratio of deaths at those different moments that we discussed today .
<en> So this accusation is not very proper , although we know there are some moral problems related to just one ' service ' .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we can hold this debate on basic principles - we have to hold it - but not without discussing a particular instrument .
<en> I am talking about what is referred to as the list of terrorist organisations .
<en> Since the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 3 September , we know that the legal assessment is perfectly clear .
<en> The system of lists of terrorist organisations of both the EU and the UN violates citizens ' fundamental rights and therefore has to be reformed .
<en> What has happened ?
<en> This EU list of terrorist organisations operates in a completely grey area without any parliamentary control .
<en> It is indeed bizarre when we as Parliament hear that a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 15 July - bringing together politicians specialising in agriculture , forestry and rural development - adopted a new EU list of terrorist organisations without debate , and without knowing what was on it .
<en> We know that foreign policy complications result , as international law is being trampled underfoot here in a completely grey area .
<en> We want to change this , and I am asking for your support in doing so .
<en> Many thanks .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am also disappointed that the French minister has left , because he could have learned , for instance , that the information that he supplied to us is incorrect .
<en> In fact , Mrs Dührkop is correct in saying that the vast majority of terrorist attacks carried out in the European Union have an independent basis and have nothing to do with Al-Qaida , contrary to Mr Jouyet 's statement .
<en> In that case , we could have removed that suggestive equation , often put forward to us , between Islam and terrorism .
<en> This is a frequent tendency and , unfortunately , it also has its adherents in this Parliament .
<en> I am thinking of the attitude adopted by Mr Borghezio in the recent Cologne demonstration as , if this framework decision were valid , he would certainly be accused of provocation to terrorism .
<en> I would define Mr Borghezio 's activities as provocation , and on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left / Nordic Green Left , I would like to make a formal request for the President of Parliament to issue an official warning to Mr Borghezio .
<en> I believe that the strategy adopted over recent years in the fight against terrorism has been a losing strategy , and has been too subordinate to US interests in the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan , in the formulation of the list of terrorist organisations , and in the restrictions placed upon the rule of law .
<en> There have been too many instances of improper handling of personal data and I believe that we must all work together - and I am just finishing now - to ensure that we do not restrict individual freedoms , to increase democratic areas and to ensure that we do not , in the name of security and the fight against terrorism , help to achieve the very goals of the terrorist organisations themselves .
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) Mr President , Mrs Lefrançois proposes important changes in order to safeguard confidentiality , freedom of expression and legal certainty .
<en> What should be viewed as criminal is incitement , not provocation , to commit terrorist offences .
<en> Protection of privacy must also apply to e-mail and other electronic correspondence and the basic principles of all our legislation , proportionality , necessity and non-discrimination , are emphasised .
<en> Excellent .
<en> But , for there is a big ' but ' : what happened to subsidiarity ?
<en> What kind of terrorism is to be dealt with at EU level ?
<en> A dreadful crime of terrorism was committed in Spain last weekend , and our sympathies go out to the Spanish people , but that crime is not an EU matter .
<en> Neither was the terrorism which continued for decades in Northern Ireland .
<en> Clearly , fear of terrorism is being deliberately exploited to advance EU positions in the fields of justice and police affairs at the expense of the Member States .
<en> Subsidiarity is a fitting subject for political speeches , but does not feature in legislation .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , this weekend the Czech Republic 's Ambassador to Pakistan became a victim of a bomb attack in that country .
<en> Yesterday , three Czech servicemen were wounded in a rocket attack in Afghanistan .
<en> These days , terrorism is having a direct impact on the citizens of my country too .
<en> There is no doubt that this is one of the most insidious and dangerous phenomena of civilisation and that we cannot give in to this cowardly and wicked evil , but must fight it .
<en> The war on terrorism must nevertheless not become an all-encompassing incantation .
<en> Despite all the bloody consequences of terrorism , everyday mistrust and fear for security cannot be placed above freedom .
<en> I therefore reject the European Commission 's proposal that incitement to commit a terrorist offence should be a crime .
<en> The proposal aims to punish verbal and written addresses and thus poses a clear threat to freedom of expression and fundamental human rights .
<en> For me , as a democratic politician , this is unacceptable .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I shall start with the report by Mrs Roure , which I once again support in its efforts to reach a political agreement on the proposal for a Framework Decision on the protection of personal data in the framework of the third pillar that is not based on the lowest common denominator , a minimum level of data protection and serious shortcomings .
<en> I should like to reiterate my position , which I have made clear here several times before : it is essential and urgent for a legal instrument to be adopted that guarantees the protection of data in the framework of the third pillar and ensures a level of protection of personal data that is at least equivalent to the level guaranteed under the first pillar by Directive 95 / 46 / EC .
<en> I very much enjoyed listening to Vice-President Barrot 's statements .
<en> He is tuned in to Parliament 's concerns , but I regret that the Council 's empty chair is a living example of the political deafness that has filtered through every presidency .
<en> I am not at all optimistic about the Council 's response .
<en> On the Lefrançois report : in 2002 we adopted a framework decision in which we harmonised the definition of ' terrorism ' and the applicable penalties .
<en> Several speakers have already referred to the Internet , the new information technologies , and the advantages they bring , but also to the use criminals can make of the net .
<en> As has already been said , there are some 5 000 terrorist propaganda sites , which are tools of radicalisation and recruitment , as well as serving as a source of information on terrorist means and methods .
<en> That is why we need to amend the 2002 Directive , so as to create the necessary instruments to deal with this form of cyberterrorism .
<en> I support Mrs Lefrançois ' proposals , which combine the urgency of this fight with the indispensable respect for freedom of speech and association .
<en> Lastly , Mr President , it is very important that Member States ratify the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism so as to ensure parallel implementation of both instruments , together with a more thorough and comprehensive legal regime .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - A common European position is needed on the effectiveness , transparency and flexibility of the way development assistance is financed before the Doha Conference on Financing for Development in late November .
<en> Thijs Berman 's report goes some way towards helping achieve that goal .
<en> I agree that reform is needed to secure greater representation of developing countries to the IMF and World Bank .
<en> Indeed , I further agree with the rapporteur 's calls to encourage Member States to adequately prepare a timetable to reach the target of 0.7 % of Europe 's GNP going to public development aid in 2015 .
<en> I therefore voted in favour of the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) The members of the People 's Party for Freedom and Democracy ( VVD ) in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Berman report , one of the reasons being that it makes useful comments about the possible role of the European Investment Bank in developing countries .
<en> However , the members of the VVD distance themselves from the 0.7 % target for development cooperation laid down in this report .
<en> It is not the quantity but the quality of development cooperation that counts .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Turbulent global finance has put the governments of the Member States under serious strain .
<en> The Estonian Government , for example , has been struggling for months to draft a balanced budget for the year 2009 .
<en> Although I supported Thijs Berman 's report , I have serious doubts about reaching the targeted Official Development Assistance level in the next couple of years .
<en> As the EU has no command of coercive measures regarding development aid , it would be naive to expect that the Member States would significantly increase their contribution when experiencing financial uncertainty .
<sp>
<2en> The European internal market is one of the most important achievements of the process of European integration .
<2en> Only a well-functioning internal market can guarantee competitive conditions for businesses activities and assist the development of the European economy .
<2en> The internal market scoreboard is an instrument that makes it possible to monitor progress in the introduction , proper transposition and correct application of directives relating to the internal market .
<2en> Analysis of the data contained in the internal market scoreboard provides some exceptionally interesting information about the work of Member States in introducing EU legislation .
<2en> It is a typically political instrument that should , however , not be treated lightly , but should serve as an instrument encouraging responsible individuals to carry out more rapid and proper transposition .
<2en> This particularly concerns the new Member States , where the deficit as regards transposition of law is often greater than the objective stated by Heads of State or Government .
<2en> The internal market scoreboard should also be used more frequently in discussions about the state of the internal market .
<2en> It is therefore essential to come up with a more accessible form of scoreboard that could also be used by citizens interested in internal market matters .
<2en> The rapporteur has drawn attention to the fact that certain directives , such as the Services Directive , are more important for the effective functioning of the internal market than others .
<2en> I share the rapporteur 's view on this and as a result I think that the European Commission should take notice of indicators that better reflect the immediate significance of directives for businesses and citizens .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) Through my positive vote today for the internal market scoreboard , I am expressing my support for the timely enforcement and accurate transposition of internal market directives into national law , because these directives constitute the prerequisite for the effective working of the internal market , and for promoting competitiveness as well as social and economic cohesion within the EU .
<en> The two scoreboards , those for the internal market and consumption market , respectively , jointly contribute to the improvement of the internal market , which is beneficial to consumers .
<en> The scoreboard should encourage timely and accurate transposition , but at the same time it should become a tool enabling policy-makers to identify barriers and fields that require new initiatives .
<en> I hope that the result of today 's vote will lead to the strengthening of the SOLVIT network and that Member States will promote the services of this network for the benefit of consumers .
<en> Member States must also make sure that SOLVIT centres are adequately staffed , so as to reduce the length of time required for examination and to solve complaints at a faster rate .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) Europe wishes to protect itself against maritime accidents and the pollution of its seas and oceans .
<en> We welcome this .
<en> The recent terrible examples of the Prestige and Erika shipwrecks are there to remind us of our duty to be careful and to monitor vessel safety , but also of our responsibilities in the event of an environmental disaster .
<en> A special reference should , moreover , be made in the proposal for a Directive to post-accident inquiries .
<en> For the first time , it has been agreed that an investigative body should be set up that is charged with deciding , with complete independence and impartiality , whether or not to open an inquiry to determine the causes and circumstances of an accident .
<en> The intentions are good ; let us only hope that they are not cast aside in the face of the huge financial interests at stake .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of this report by my Belgian colleague , Mr Sterckx , on the regulation of maritime traffic .
<en> Since the Erika shipwreck of 1999 and that of the Prestige in 2002 , we have been waiting in vain for European solutions to ensure that such disasters never happen again .
<en> Far from having decreased , the risk increases every day : maritime traffic is set to triple in the next 30 years .
<en> In spite of this worrying prediction , the majority of Member States have been quick to ' sink ' the main measures put forward by the Commission and supported by the European Socialists .
<en> One noticeable disappearance is that of an insurance policy , by means of a financial guarantee , that would make it easier for the victims of maritime disasters to be compensated .
<en> Adopting this report means opposing cynicism and the irresponsibility of states .
<en> Parliament can be proud of its unity , because , through its vote today , it is showing its unstinting commitment to safer and less polluted European waters .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I and my Irish EPP-ED colleagues abstained on the report on the amendments to the Kohlicek Report .
<en> We did so due to concerns relating to the impact of the division of investigations into technical and criminal and the problems that this would create under Irish law .
<en> We support the general thrust of this and all the Maritime Reports adopted today in plenary .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Representing Scotland , I recognise the importance of maritime transport and believe that this sector is one which has immense potential for future development .
<en> It is vital that adequate measures are taken to maximise safety at sea and to prevent accidents ; accordingly this package , which will serve to prevent repeat accidents occurring , is one which I welcome .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Costa report deals with important issues for all maritime regions .
<en> It is vital that the EU is serious about improving safety standards at sea whilst not placing unrealistic burdens on carriers .
<en> I fully support the notion that national authorities and port authorities play a vital role in identifying risks involved in this area and am on the whole satisfied with the measures adopted by this House today .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I welcome the positive vote today on recognising energy poverty and reducing VAT for energy saving goods .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) There is much that the EU can do to reduce the problem of obesity and on which we should focus attention in Parliament .
<en> It is good therefore that Parliament today voted for the report on nutrition , overweight and obesity .
<en> One of the consequences of that decision is that Parliament is now calling for a ban on trans-fats .
<en> At the same time , however , we think that the report could have said a lot less about what schools should do and what food they should serve .
<en> We think that is best decided at national or local level .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) The fight against the serious public health problem of overweight- and obesity-related disease must be a priority from the early stages of life .
<en> This report asks Member States , local entities and school authorities to monitor and to improve the quality and nutritional standards of school meals .
<en> Nutritional information on food is important , particularly the difference between natural trans-fatty acids present in meat and dairy products and those produced during industrial processing ( artificial ) .
<en> The undifferentiated labelling of trans fats will only confuse consumers , create a negative image of healthy dairy products and have undesirable effects on consumption , undermining public health ( reduced intake of important nutrients such as calcium and proteins , for example ) .
<en> European indicators such as waist size are useful for monitoring the risk factors people are exposed to in relation to various obesity-related diseases .
<en> An understanding of the distribution of abdominal obesity facilitates the planning of more effective measures to minimise such problems .
<en> I agree with colour coding to label foods because , rather than clear and easily understandable labelling , what Europeans need are signs that they can interpret in order to make healthy choices .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) Overweight and diet-related diseases are a serious public health problem , which means that the fight against obesity must be set as a priority from the early stages of life .
<en> The Foglietta report is highly relevant in calling on Member States , local entities and school authorities to monitor and improve the quality and nutritional standards of school meals .
<en> I believe that nutritional information must always be provided on food , particularly an indication of artificial trans-fats , because these have more negative effects on health .
<en> Failure to distinguish artificial trans-fats from natural fats would mislead consumers and only contribute towards a negative image of some animal foods that contain natural trans-fats , such as meat and dairy products .
<en> I also voted for the development of European indicators such as waist size and other obesity-related risk factors because I believe they may be useful in the future for assessing the risks facing the population , and for the success of the measures implemented .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I cannot support this report or Amendment 6 as I feel that it is inappropriate to include tax- or VAT-based issues in a health-based report such as this .

<en> on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , this has been batted to and fro between the Commission and the Council ever since 2002 : six years .
<en> There has been no common position until June of this year - but now they pass it to Parliament like a hot potato .
<en> Is this sudden change of mind due to the current economic downturn , I wonder ?
<en> Whether that is so or not , it will not help in these times of rising unemployment , because the report says that temporary workers are to be paid the same as permanent , full-time workers .
<en> Wrong !
<en> At one end , temporary agencies use this to get young people a start in life , or another go .
<en> At the other end , inexperienced workers will be paid the same as experienced , long-time employees , which goes right against established practice .
<en> This discourages employee loyalty , which every firm needs .
<en> More experience equals more skill , equals more pay .
<en> It is a bad move .
<en> Reject it .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , this is a bad piece of legislation - not as bad as it might have been , but nonetheless bad .
<en> Like so much employment regulation in this Parliament , it is introduced in the name of workers ' rights and yet its main effect will be to deny thousands upon thousands of people the right to work at all .
<en> It makes our labour markets less competitive and less flexible .
<en> It damages our economies at the very time we can least afford to have them damaged .
<en> Temporary work is widely and correctly recognised as a ladder back into permanent employment for those workers who for some reason have been temporarily out of the labour market .
<en> What we are doing in this House today is kicking away that ladder which helped workers back into employment .
<en> The British Government has been resisting this measure for a long time but has finally found itself unable to resist it .
<en> You could not ask for a clearer example of the way the EU subverts democracy in Member States .
<sp>
<en> ( PT ) Madam President , Mr Bertrand , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased with this report which concludes an issue pending since 2002 .
<en> In my opinion , this is a balanced result which protects temporary workers , increases the flexibility of the labour market and respects the principle of subsidiarity .
<en> This proposal generally ensures equal treatment from day one for workers provided through temporary employment agencies .
<en> However , it also offers social partners the option to agree otherwise , if they so wish .
<en> Bearing in mind the different practices and legislation of the Member States in this area , it is encouraging that Parliament , the Council and the Commission have reached agreement .
<en> This agreement will ensure a stable framework for temporary employment agencies whose role in the European labour market is undeniable .
<en> The increased regulatory transparency may help to create jobs and allow for new and more flexible forms of working .
<en> I know that economic development requires the labour market to be more flexible , but this flexibility will only be beneficial for all if it is achieved while ensuring respect for workers ' rights in all aspects , in particular in relation to health and safety at work .
<en> In my opinion , the final text of this directive is a good example of this balance .
<en> I hope , Mr Bertrand , that I will be able to say the same next month on the Working Time Directive .
<en> I must thank Mr Désir for his work and also the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Morin , who is from my political family .
<en> I congratulate her on having contributed so significantly to this end result .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) I would like to begin by saying that I will be voting in favour of the proposal since the current version clearly represents the best that we can manage .
<en> I feel that the next step is to closely monitor how it is put into practice by the Member States .
<en> Some Member States have proper legal arrangements regulating the position of agency workers , but the arrangements for accrediting newly-established agencies are woefully inadequate .
<en> In other words , anyone at all can employ people and there are virtually no controls at all over the activities of some dubious employment agencies .
<en> I refer to the situation in the Czech Republic , of course .
<en> In order to boost their earnings , agencies often employ workers not on the basis of employment contracts but on the basis of work performance agreements so that they can avoid paying social and medical insurance for their employees .
<en> As a result , wages can be set at the minimum wage , but the workers are clearly left out of pocket after their contributions have been paid .
<en> It is generally suspect that the numbers of agency workers are constantly increasing at the expense of those working under permanent full-time contracts of employment .
<en> It is therefore the task of labour inspection bodies and trade unions to draw attention to the crooked practices that go on in some countries and not to allow any restrictions on the right of agency workers to join trade unions .
<en> Despite the apparent good intentions in the current version of the draft directive , much remains to be done in terms of putting it into effect .
<en> And in response to what has been said here by certain members of the European Parliament , may I say that I would take great pleasure employing them as agency workers so they can see for themselves what fun it is .
<sp>
<en> ( ET ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen .
<en> In Estonia we say : ' better late than never ' , and it is a positive development that we are finally passing the temporary agency worker directive .
<en> Temporary agency work is becoming increasingly widespread , and thus it is very important that it be regulated .
<en> The directive is also of great significance to those countries that do not yet have access to the labour market of the European Union countries , and whose workers are primarily used for improper purposes , violating their equal rights .
<en> We know today that the protection of temporary agency workers is guaranteed very differently from one Member State to another .
<en> There are Member States in which such protection is completely absent .
<en> As a result I believe that the draft directive in its present wording will help to ensure throughout Europe at least a minimum level of fundamental protection for temporary agency workers , which will rule out the discrimination of workers who use this form of employment , compared to other forms of employment .
<en> I hope we will pass this directive , and I also hope that we will not give it a very long term of implementation .

<en> ( FR ) Madam President , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is trying desperately to contest the competence of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality on the question of equality between men and women in the workplace .
<en> It has seized our initiative to draft a report on the discriminatory effects of pay differentials and other inequalities on women 's pensions and on the trend towards the individualisation of social security rights .
<en> The outcome is a hotchpotch report which strings together universally known generalities .
<en> We are a long way from the unequal treatment of women on pensions and the remedies on which the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality wished to predicate its report .
<en> As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights on the basis of Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure , I did my best , with the unanimous support of the Committee on Women 's Rights , to propose specific corrections within the framework of the pension system reforms .
<en> There are six very precise corrections designed to plug the gaps in women 's insurance as a result , for example , of maternity and their family commitments .
<en> Can you believe that the Committee on Employment expressly rejected them , in flagrant contradiction of its obligations under Rule 47 ?
<en> I am sorry that we have lost a battle , but the war and our fight will continue .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Madam President , I have voted against the Klamt report for the simple reason that the entire concept of economic immigration and what is being referred to as the ' blue card ' bears witness to short-term thinking .
<en> We should , instead , adopt a policy of training , re-training and getting the approximately 20 million unemployed that are currently in the European Union back into jobs .
<en> We should , instead , learn from our past mistakes .
<en> A case in point is the importing of guest workers and their families in the 70s and 80s , which turned into a major social problem .
<en> They are now trying to appease the public by promising that this only involves highly-qualified and temporary immigrants , but who am I to doubt the words of Louis Michel , who states that other immigrants should also remain welcome .
<en> In other words , the floodgates remain open .
<en> All they are doing is creating a new one .
<en> This is about a coalition against society .
<en> Big business wants cheap labour and joins forces with the multi-cultural Left , with society left to pick up the tab .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , I voted for the Parish report on the integration of the CMO in wine , the single CMO , with a heavy heart , because I consider that this single CMO is not a simplification and does not increase transparency .
<en> It will make life more complicated for wine-growers and for the entire wine industry .
<en> The Commissioner tried to reassure us yesterday evening .
<en> I hope that the Commission will keep its word and that , most importantly , the profession will continue to be adequately represented on the advisory committee , as it has been since the first CMO in wine .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , this morning I voted with some hesitation in favour of the report by Neil Parish on the creation of a single market organisation for a wide range of different agricultural products .
<en> I welcome the Commission 's objective of simplifying European agricultural policy .
<en> This means that in future there will only be one market organisation which will replace the 21 existing market organisations , for example , for fruit , vegetables , milk and wine .
<en> However , the administration of the resulting highly complex document must be made as simple as possible .
<en> For this reason , I am very pleased that the Commission gave the assurance in yesterday 's debate that it will take up my idea and include in the EUR-Lex European search engine the functionality to allow users to access only the articles which relate to their specific agricultural product .
<en> The Commission has also confirmed that the wine market organisation , which was negotiated with some difficulty and which includes many of Parliament 's requirements , will remain unchanged .
<en> It is only for this reason that I felt able to vote in favour of the report .
<sp>
<en> - ( SK ) I am delighted that , a few days ahead of 1 December , which is recognised as World AIDS Day , we are addressing this global problem .
<en> The number of people infected with the HIV virus is growing .
<en> About 14 000 people are infected every day , and 2 000 of these are children under 15 years old .
<en> In addition to the usual hot-spots such as Africa and the Far East , the number of infected people has risen in Eastern Europe and in Central Asia .
<en> In 2006 the number of infected people in these regions rose to 1.7 million .
<en> The largest increase was recorded in Russia and Ukraine , where about 270 000 people were infected with the HIV virus .
<en> The spread of HIV in these areas is caused mainly through drug abuse and the use of dirty needles .
<en> In the case of Ukraine the figures are all the more alarming as they involve a direct neighbour of the European Union .
<en> The fact that we have failed to bring the HIV problem under control despite worldwide prevention programmes should lead us to reassess these programmes and to intensify efforts aimed at prevention and the production of effective cures .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Borloo .
<en> You will be combating unemployment and poverty in the coming months and years .
<en> We therefore require a sensible package .
<en> We do not need free allocation up to 100 % in the industry affected by carbon leakage , we need 100 % allocation , and we need ex ante benchmarks .
<en> For those businesses not at risk from carbon leakage , I believe the 20 / 20 solution is the best so that we can start with 20 % increases and also achieve the target with 20 % increases .
<en> We also want the small and medium-sized businesses to be exempted here , that is to say , in particular , the businesses with 25 000 tonnes , which are to be increased to 50 000 tonnes .
<en> Then we would still have 80 % of SMEs outside which have only 27 % of the CO2 .
<en> We should also make an effort to keep the money in the businesses and not to tax it and send it abroad .
<en> We urgently need the money in the businesses in order to be able to promote innovation and research .
<en> Please also ensure that decreasing depreciation is possible , so that businesses can invest in these areas quickly and in good time .
<en> We also need a formula in the international agreement which specifies up to 30 % and not 30 % as an absolute figure .
<en> We also need a clear idea of what an international agreement must contain .
<en> In the case of heat pumps , I would request that we really ensure that air-air heat pumps are also included accordingly because in that way , together with solar energy , we can naturally prevent a great deal of CO2 .
<en> I also request that we make the International Atomic Energy Safety Standards mandatory for the European nuclear industry and that we have independent regulators in Europe who can also share in decision-making in the other Member States in order to ensure safety here .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , many of the new Member States , like Hungary after the end of the 1980s and the collapse of the old industry , reduced their greenhouse gas emissions .
<en> Due to this process , every sixth Hungarian - about a million people - lost his or her job .
<en> As the basis for the reduction here in the current proposal is 2005 and not 1990 , some older Member States could raise their emission values without any consequences .
<en> This is very unfair to the new Member States .
<en> After the losses in our economy we need fair compensation .
<en> District heating is mainly a social question in many new Member States .
<en> The decision of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety that gives free allowances for district heating in the ETS is essential for us , and we must keep this achievement during the trialogue as well .
<en> I think that the use of carbon capture and storage should be judged by the market and the competition .
<en> As this is a very new and expensive technology , we have to be more cautious before subsidising it with public money .
<en> My last point is that without a proper penalty system the whole package will fail .
<en> If we do not force the Member States to keep to the emission limits , all our efforts are wasted .
<en> That is why I urge this Parliament to insist that we should keep our achievements concerning the penalty system because , without a penalty system , there will be no working system at all .
<sp>
<en> Ladies and gentlemen , your attention please .
<en> Although we are very close to the end of the debate , I am going to have to interrupt for reasons that you will understand .
<en> The next item is the formal sitting at 11.30 a.m. with His Holiness the Dalai Lama ; following the formal sitting this debate will continue .
<en> There are just two speakers left on my list , plus anyone wishing to speak under the ' catch-the-eye ' procedure , and the representatives of the Council and the Commission .
<en> After we have finished debating the state of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package , we will proceed with voting as normal .
<en> ( The debate was suspended at 11.30 a.m. for the formal sitting )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) As regards the economy , the main challenges faced by the European Union during the French Presidency were actions linked to the climate and energy package and the financial crisis .
<en> Following its significant enlargement , Europe has become more varied , encompassing many different areas each with their own specific characteristics .
<en> The differences concern more than the level of economic development of the Member States .
<en> That is why it is so difficult to find single instruments with which to solve the diverse problems facing the individual economies of the Member States .
<en> Actions to combat the crisis must therefore involve a package of varied instruments for use during the crisis .
<en> I refer for instance to reducing the VAT rate or lifting some of the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact .
<en> The climate and energy package should be adjusted to the condition and specific characteristics of the individual economies and their sectors .
<en> I do not believe that the range of actions in the framework of the package is appropriate for the current situation .
<en> The concessions and benefits obtained by individual states will not succeed in evening out their changes in development , because the starting points differ so widely .
<en> I therefore advocate a systematic review of this package and an analysis of its state and progress .
<en> This should serve as a basis for the introduction of essential amendments .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to congratulate the French Presidency for the work it has done , enabling us to reach an acceptable compromise on the energy and climate change package .
<2en> Adopting this package makes the European Union number one in the fight against climate change , based on the example it has shown and the commitment it has made .
<2en> In Copenhagen the European Union will have arguments which it can use to negotiate with the other states from around the world so that we can contribute at a global level , through our joint effort , to reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
<2en> I also congratulate the French Presidency for its involvement in adopting the Third Maritime Safety Package ' Erika III ' through conciliation .
<2en> Based on the lessons learned from maritime accidents in recent years , the EU has tightened the regulations on maritime transport safety and drawn up specific measures and clear solutions for dealing with maritime accidents .
<2en> Progress has also been made , albeit insufficient , in the areas of sustainable transport , the Single European Sky and road safety .
<2en> I would have liked us during the French Presidency to have made progress on the road package , energy package and telecoms package as well .
<2en> In addition , the full debates held in Parliament and the Council on the impact of the rise in energy and food prices showed Europe 's citizens that the social agenda is one of the European Union 's top priorities .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , as we review the achievements of the French Presidency , I should like to draw attention to several issues that impact on the overall assessment of this period .
<en> It is true that , in August , President Sarkozy 's intervention concerning the situation in Georgia resulted in a cessation of military action .
<en> In fact , however , the cessation of military action owed more to Russia 's economic interests and its relationship with France than to a genuine desire to solve the problems that had led to the war .
<en> The next issue I wish to mention relates to the future development and management of the European Union .
<en> It concerns the approach to ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> In the case of Ireland , successive referendums are to be organised until a result serving the interests of the largest Member States of the Union is obtained .
<en> This demonstrates that the interests of Germany , France and several other countries can override accepted principles and democratic debate .
<en> Furthermore , the fact that the Irish public is being bought over through opt-outs from the Treaty demonstrates that every country can be treated differently in the European Union and bought over .
<en> This decision confirms how bending the law has become an increasingly common practice in Community institutions .
<en> I would remind the House that it was under this Presidency that the decision for the European Union to do away with certain Polish shipyards was taken .
<en> This decision was taken at the same time as industry and banks are being renationalised elsewhere in the Community , as is the case in your country , Sir .
<en> Under your direction too , the Presidency failed to agree to increase agricultural subsidies up to an equal level .
<en> The French Presidency kept them at a level that is very detrimental to the new Member States .
<en> Mr President , you focused on pursuing the interests of France , rather than those of all the Member States of the European Union .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 2.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m. )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Yesterday I mentioned during the debate that I consider the present compromise to be an honourable one and that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance in the European Parliament will be endorsing it .
<2en> I wish to stress , however , that , in order to reach agreement with the farming lobby and the pesticides industry , we had to make a few concessions .
<2en> Whichever way you look at it , what was achieved in terms of the cut-off criteria is a watered-down result when compared to the EP 's position at first reading .
<2en> Derogation options were expressly created for 12 substances .
<2en> We also had our reservations with regard to the zonal approach .
<2en> The idea of three zones across such a vast expanse strikes us as problematic because the environmental circumstances within any of those zones can vary enormously .
<2en> What is positive , though , is that the legal basis is founded on agriculture , the internal market and public health , with the concern for public health being given top priority in the relevant recitals and in Article 1 .
<2en> Equally , the cut-off criteria for substances that have unacceptable effects on bees are a welcome addition .
<2en> The requirement to replace dangerous products with safe alternatives more quickly was also complied with .
<2en> Whilst the outcome could have been better , we voted on an acceptable compromise .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I was disappointed to see the common position amended .
<en> I would prefer the common position as it would give a better balance between public health and food production .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The continued lack of a thorough impact assessment means that the EPLP is unable to support the compromise package negotiated between the Council and the European Parliament rapporteur , as there is no clear indication of its impact on food production .
<en> Labour MEPs do wish to see better and safer pesticides , but we also have a responsibility to both producers and consumers to be sure what the eventual effects of the current proposals on agricultural production and food prices would be .
<en> Whilst the deal certainly would not have the catastrophic effects that have been predicted in certain quarters , the uncertainty involved is great enough for the EPLP to be unable to support the compromise package .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Today we have abstained from the vote on this plant protection legislation .
<en> It is a very difficult vote .
<en> We have been involved in all parts of the intense negotiations on this controversial package right up to this point .
<en> The emphasis of this legislation is clearly on health and the links between chemical substances and cancer .
<en> Farmers are most affected due to direct contact .
<en> While this package seeks to limit the availability of carcinogens , Member States may allow substances on the market where there is a serious threat to plant health .
<en> The proposal seeks to protect bees and reduce red tape for substance authorisation .
<en> With a gradual withdrawal of substances until 2016 , we would urge industry to come up with biologically sound and effective products .
<en> We cannot vote in favour of this legislation .
<en> Despite repeated calls for a more recent impact assessment , none was forthcoming from the Commission .
<en> We cannot legislate in the abstract !
<en> Products will be banned based on hazard as opposed to scientific risk , which would be based on use and exposure .
<en> In addition , the definition of " endocrine disruptor ” has not been agreed at scientific level and we have tabled amendments to await the opinion of Commission experts to address this .
<sp>
<2en> With this text limiting the production and sale of pesticides , and the accompanying text setting out the framework for their use , Europe has finally achieved exemplary standards for pesticides .
<2en> Hiltrud Breyer 's report is on the right lines .
<2en> Whilst allowing low-risk products onto the market , it bans 22 substances deemed to be very harmful .
<2en> If we are to hope eventually for rational agriculture around the world , we must welcome this advance by the European Union .
<2en> European agriculture , which makes abundant use of plant protection products , will not be weakened .
<2en> However , with these texts , the EU will have the most rigorous legislation in the fight against toxic pesticides .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thousands of children a year fall victim to child traffickers and even more are abducted .
<en> A current study shows that it is unaccompanied minors who are the victims of such crimes .
<en> That is why we welcome the fact that the European Commission , in its amendments to the old regulation , now takes due account of children .
<en> When we demand that children too should have their biometric data in passports from a certain age , it is not due to mass hysteria , which I really do not share , but because we want to afford our children better protection .
<en> However , such protection can only be afforded if every child has its own passport with its biometric data and the names of its guardians .
<en> As with all data collection , it is especially important to my group that the highest possible security is guaranteed when collecting , storing and processing the biometric data of all citizens and we must always be able to track who can access what data .
<en> The Council 's regulations and decisions which affect this point make provision for very high protective mechanisms and control bodies to prevent data abuse .
<en> I have to say that I have fundamental confidence in my national authorities , unlike many private companies , some of which are able to pass unprotected data to third parties through scandalous security loopholes and receive due payment for doing so .
<en> That is precisely why it is so important for national authorities to capitalise on their established credibility and work closely with the data protection authorities .
<en> Contrary to what has happened here , this includes the European Commission honouring its legal obligations to consult European data protection officers .
<en> ( PT ) I would like to congratulate my friend Carlos Coelho on the excellent work he has done for this Parliament .
<en> Thank you very much .
<sp>
<en> ( BG ) Thank you , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Coelho , for the balance he has achieved in this report between ensuring a higher level of security for international travel documents and protecting the personal data and human integrity of the European Union 's citizens .
<en> The suggestions made to improve a number of technical requirements will support the battle against cross-border crime , illegal immigration and human trafficking .
<en> For border countries like Bulgaria , which are exposed to intense pressure from migratory flows and the activities of international organised crime , the rapid and successful introduction of the new standards will be vitally important in terms of protecting the EU 's external borders .
<en> Unfortunately , in my country we have a few serious cases involving children who have disappeared , about whom there is still no information even now .
<en> This is why I feel that this report provides sound guidelines for the future development of standards for security features and biometrics in passports for Europe 's youngest citizens .
<en> The introduction of the principle of ' one person-one passport ' will provide them with an even higher level of security when travelling outside the territory of the European Union .
<en> The proposal to introduce additional information in the passports of children up to the age of 18 years will limit opportunities for the illegal activity of child trafficking .
<en> When it comes to applying the regulation within their national legislations , Member States obviously need to consider the possible financial repercussions for large families .
<en> This was also mentioned by some of our fellow Members who spoke previously .
<en> Freedom of movement must not be restricted for these families due to them having to pay a large amount of money for passports for their children .
<en> Finally , on the subject of free movement of persons within the European Union , I think that the limits can be abolished on the age of entitlement to receive an identity card as this will also encourage and guarantee free movement for the EU 's youngest citizens .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and by saying that I endorse this report .
<en> I think the report is not only important , but also good .
<en> I will perhaps begin with the statement which has been made here that a passport is a document issued by Member States in accordance with national regulations .
<en> It is true that we have different passports , besides the covers , but it is important to find a balance between the security measures of these passports , so that they identify a citizen of the European Union or another person entering the territory of the European Union , and at the same time resist crime , much of which involves passports , such as illegal immigration , terrorism , child trafficking or forgery of documents .
<en> That balance has , I think , been found in this report .
<en> There are no indications that the restrictions which we are including in the report will in any way influence or restrict Member States in the issue of passports .
<en> I want to draw attention to one principle which I fully endorse : the principle of ' one person-one passport ' .
<en> In relation to children it is a good principle , but I would not like it to be a financial barrier to parents who want their children to have a passport , but whose financial means may be limited .
<en> I also want to draw attention to one weaker moment in the report , although the rapporteur has drawn attention to it , namely to the fact that modern , untried technologies need to be reassessed , and it is good that in three years ' time we will be able to do this .
<en> I also call for the role of the European Data Protection Supervisor to nevertheless be taken into account .
<en> That EU institution must be more heavily involved in the whole procedure and it is for this which I call .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I also wish to thank Mr Coelho .
<en> This report is very important for the future of Europe and for its 500 million citizens : for their safety , their security and for anti-terrorism measures , amongst others .
<en> If the technology is there , as Ms Zdravkova said , we should make use of it .
<en> From the point of view of children , Ms Angelilli , Mr Lambrinidis and others have said that it can be a vital weapon to counter child-smuggling , for example .
<en> However , the crucial point is really in the new Article 3 , which states that the purpose of biometric data is to verify not only the authenticity of the document but also the identity of the holder by means of directly available comparable features .
<en> At the moment , most countries rely almost exclusively on photographs and very few people , I would suggest - perhaps not even you , Mr President , nor even Mr Barroso - look like their passport photos - nor , indeed , would many of us want to !
<en> So I think that if there are new identity procedures and methods available , we should be prepared to use them .
<en> As for Ms Gacek and Mr Batten and their anti-British , ' hit-and-run ' contributions - because they are not here now to hear any response - I would suggest that the UK system is probably no better or no worse than many others in the European Union .
<en> We have checks and balances , but we can do better .
<en> If new 21st-century technology is available , then we should be prepared to make use of it and , as Ms Grabowska said a few moments ago , we should be prepared to amend it constantly to make the best possible use of what facilities are around the European Union .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) Protecting children from abduction and trafficking requires the introduction of children 's passports .
<en> The principle of ' one person-one passport ' means that every child travelling outside the Schengen area will be issued a passport .
<en> The new method of identification will simplify border controls .
<en> The instruments for protecting children from abduction will include a European helpline for reporting missing , abducted or sexually exploited children , passports with biometric data and the soon-to-be launched pan-European child abduction alert system .
<en> Attention needs to be paid to ensuring a high degree of confidentiality in the process of acquiring and using biometric data .
<en> I support the rapporteur 's view that a study needs to be performed into the possible shortcomings of fingerprint identification systems in the Member States of the European Union .
<en> Subsequently , the introduction of a common European system for comparing fingerprints should be considered .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , welcome Commissioner , tomorrow we will vote on the report prepared by my fellow Member , Mr Cappato , on public access to documents .
<2en> Mr Cashman , a very good and normally unbelievably efficient colleague , has already pointed out that the most important thing is to give the public access to documents that are discussed and decided upon here .
<2en> One might accuse Mr Cappato , as Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Cashman have done , of going beyond the remit .
<2en> That is surely a matter of interpretation and in this case also not entirely justified .
<2en> The discussion as to whether or not , in principle , the group meetings should be broadcast is surely something we can talk about .
<2en> The question is , then , whether we would have the right , for example , to hold such a meeting in private at the request of the majority of the group members , as there are certainly sensitive issues - as we all know from our own meetings - that need to be clarified between ourselves before we can go public with them .
<2en> In my opinion , it is normal to wash your dirty laundry at home and not out in the street .
<2en> I might also add that this example shows that political parties - not the party groups in this case - always have a certain interest in the general public when it suits them .
<2en> Otherwise , party conferences would not be broadcast so extensively .
<2en> Interestingly , no one complains that the conferences of some political parties where things can get quite lively could be broadcast in full .
<2en> I think I can say , therefore , that Mr Cappato has produced a good piece of work here , even though - as we are accustomed to - suggestions for improvement may perhaps come from other groups .
<2en> In some cases they are , in fact , so good that they should be considered .
<2en> Compared to either of the other institutions , Parliament can still be considered to lead the way when it comes to transparency and so I would not make it my top priority , since with regard to both the accessibility of documents and to the transparency of its sittings and the activities of the Members of the European Parliament , we are more open than any national parliament .
<2en> That does not mean that there is no need for improvement , including in other institutions , particularly the Council , which , regrettably , is not here now .
<2en> Mr Cashman has just said that we need to know who has made what decision and how in order to be able to establish accountability for political actions .
<2en> It is even more important , however , to provide access to documents produced within the framework of the comitology procedure , for example .
<2en> A specific example is the Regulation on liquids in hand luggage , the annex to which was not accessible to citizens , and neither was it accessible to parliamentarians .
<2en> The requirement for transparency has not been introduced in most Member States of the European Union without good reason , and that is to give the people the opportunity to understand the political activities , to be able to establish accountability and then perhaps also to enable different decisions to be made in elections .
<2en> Thank you very much for the extra time , Mr President .
<2en> Good luck , Marco .
<2en> I will be with you in the vote tomorrow , and I believe that we will bring this to a satisfactory conclusion .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , if the European Union is to be for the citizens , rather than for the Eurocrats , then it obviously must be more transparent , as must the activities of the European Union 's bodies .
<2en> Only then may the Union regain the credibility it has carelessly tossed aside .
<2en> For example , its credibility has been damaged by attempts to push the Constitutional Treaty through and the failure to hold national referenda .
<2en> That is why it is right to demand that all Council debates , as they decide the fate of Europe , should be accessible to the citizens of the Member States of the European Union .
<2en> However , these debates do not include political group debates .
<2en> It is also important for Parliament , the Council and the European Commission to adopt the same principles for providing access to documents , so that they do not remain lone stars in the information and IT firmament .
<2en> I think that this report is a significant step towards transparency .
<2en> However , I firmly believe that , with regard to certain issues , it may be taking things a step too far .
<2en> Even Comrade Lenin once said that we sometimes need to take two steps forward , in order to take that one step back .
<2en> The rapporteur might want to bear this in mind .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the report by the rapporteur , Mr Cappato , indicates that there are major shortcomings with regard to access to EU documents .
<2en> I support the rapporteur 's proposal for improvements in connection with the annual report .
<2en> I also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
<2en> I furthermore assume that Parliament will vote in favour of a real principle of public access in the forthcoming vote on Mr Cashman 's report concerning the Regulation on public access .
<2en> As regards the annual report , I would particularly like to highlight the fact that it is totally unacceptable for public access not to be guaranteed in respect of delegated legislation , which includes 90 % of the legally binding legal acts that are adopted each year by the EU institutions .
<2en> Members ' participation in the work of Parliament and all their financial circumstances with regard to their appointment in Parliament must also be totally transparent .
<2en> I support the proposal for a combined public register .
<2en> Finally , I would like to say that increased public access is not a populistic requirement but a democratic one .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , in a democracy , transparency is a concept of honour .
<2en> In democratic countries , the citizens elect the governing authorities .
<2en> These authorities appoint officials to implement democratic decisions .
<2en> It would therefore be absurd for these elected representatives and appointed officials to be entitled to withhold information from their electorate .
<2en> The fact that this happens nevertheless has two explanations .
<2en> The first is a legacy from a pre-democratic society where the people were seen as subjects under non-elected rulers .
<2en> The subjects were not permitted to interfere in the ruler 's affairs .
<2en> The second is that the nation 's security , consideration of citizens ' integrity , business secrets , market influence and similar considerations may require exceptions to transparency .
<2en> The first explanation is completely irrelevant today .
<2en> The authorities must not , in their capacity as authorities , withhold information from the people .
<2en> The second explanation , however , is sound and involves a difficult balancing act .
<2en> These legitimate demands for finding the right balance are , unfortunately , often used by the authorities to preserve the option of secretiveness .
<2en> The EU does not have a proud tradition of transparency .
<2en> In its childhood and early youth , the EU was almost totally secret , even down to the Commission 's internal telephone directory .
<2en> The EU began as a mandarin empire , and still is today , but important steps have been taken : the 1993 Code of Conduct , the acceptance of the Swedish Journalists ' Association 's demands in 1998 , and the Regulation in 2001 .
<2en> It is with a certain amount of pride that I note that my own country , Sweden , has the longest historical tradition of statutory transparency .
<2en> That was why the Swedish state became involved in the Turco case and got the European Court of Justice to override the Council and the Court of First Instance last summer .
<2en> This was yet another step away from the mandarin empire , but the road to establishing democratic transparency in the EU is a long one .
<2en> There is a lot of internal resistance to quash .
<2en> Mr Cappato 's report should therefore receive the full support of this House , which would be yet another step forward along that long road .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am just going to speak for a few seconds to say that I agree with a good part of Mr Cappato 's report .
<en> It would be surprising if I felt otherwise , because I believe I am the only Italian MEP who has tried to make public a list of attendances and the number of questions raised here in our Parliament by the Italian delegation .
<en> I have done this , year by year , in the small book in which I report on my parliamentary activities .
<en> I would be happier if , for example , the Italian press , which all too often points its finger at us , would publish information that may not be earth-shattering in itself but would nevertheless serve to illustrate the type of activities that an Italian MEP carries out in this place .
<en> It would be all the better if it could serve to highlight how our actions , if properly performed , are independent of the political affiliations for which we have been elected , in the sense that we seek to be of service to the entire system .
<en> I applaud Mr Cappato 's initiative .
<en> I will vote for nearly everything contained in his proposal .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , the European Union has had six months of drama , dynamism and declarations under President Sarkozy , and now you have taken over , Mr President , with a sense of humour that may take some getting used to .
<en> I hope that yours will be a constructive , productive Council Presidency , as the EU faces immense challenges .
<en> You yourself mentioned the war between Israel and Hamas and the economic crisis , and of course there are also internal issues such as the Treaty of Lisbon .
<en> Allow me to take up one aspect of your speech : energy security .
<en> You stressed its fundamental importance , and I agree with you that energy is the basic raw material of modern society .
<en> Our lifestyle , our economy , our further development - all of this depends upon it .
<en> We cannot be dependent on energy supplies .
<en> Independence requires that we have a good mix of various energy sources .
<en> Therefore , I hope that with your open , direct manner , you will be able to persuade your European partners to engage in a new discussion on nuclear power and , in particular , to encourage the German Government to end its anti-nuclear policy .
<en> This is a requirement of security for our continent .
<en> There is a great deal to be done , and this is your opportunity to take Europe forward .
<en> I should like to express my thanks and my confidence in successful cooperation to come .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , President-in-Office , there is only one yardstick against which to measure the Czech presidency appointed by your Government , and the dramatic events of recent weeks , and that is the energy policy of the European Union .
<en> Today we are coming to the end of yet another round of energy disputes between Russia and Europe , but we still have no systemic guarantee or political framework to avoid similar problems in future .
<en> After the energy crises of 2004 , 2006 and 2008 it is high time for the European Union to get on with diversification , not just of energy supplies , but of the very sources of energy we so urgently need .
<en> For this reason I expect the Czech presidency to take fresh steps towards securing financial support for the Nabucco gas pipeline and a more vigorous energy policy in Central Asia .
<en> I therefore expect the Northern Gas Pipeline to be struck off the list of the European Commission 's priority , for failure to take these measures will mean waking up next winter to the same problems as we have now .
<sp>
<en> - ( FR ) Madam President , Europe 's credibility is at stake with regard to the energy issue .
<en> Thank you , Mr Barroso , for your very clear words this morning .
<en> These Gazprom and Naftogaz companies , this performance that we have been seeing for two , three , four , five days now , it is unbelievable !
<en> From now on , we have to say : ' Gentlemen , enough is enough ! '
<en> To do that , we have to act together .
<en> Thank you for the good coordination !
<en> Can someone here explain to me what these visits to Moscow by the Slovakian and the Bulgarian Prime Ministers are all about ?
<en> This already shows Gazprom that we are not united .
<en> Explain these two visits to me .
<en> Moving on , I believe that the Commission has a major role to play : we need to establish emergency gas plans .
<en> The first thing to do is to recast the Gas Security Directive , otherwise the European Commission will not have enough political power to act .
<en> European coordination is required .
<en> Secondly , we need an emergency ' Central and Eastern Europe gas infrastructure ' plan , with the money that is available .
<en> Thirdly , we need to combine Europe 's economic recovery with a major energy investment plan .
<en> The main priority is the buildings in Eastern Europe .
<en> It is scandalous to see such a small proportion of the Structural Funds being invested in something useful !
<en> Rather than having stadiums built for European championships , I would prefer money to be invested for our citizens - in buildings , heating networks and renewable energies .
<en> My final remark is that we are more dependent when it comes to nuclear energy than we are with respect to gas .
<en> We import 99 % of our nuclear fuels !
<en> Stop linking nuclear energy to independence !
<en> Mrs Koch-Mehrin , you sound ridiculous when you mention that .
<sp>
<en> ( CS ) Prime Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I am quite sure there is no one in this hall who envies the Czech Presidency the circumstances in which it has assumed the leadership of the European Community .
<en> Prime Minister , one of the main slogans you have proclaimed for your Presidency is a Europe without Barriers .
<en> This slogan can be interpreted in different ways , depending on one 's political and personal experience .
<en> Personally , I believe that it cannot be understood as nothing more than a further relaxation of financial and market mechanisms ; rather , I see it as a challenge to refine what Europe can rightly be proud of , namely the European social model .
<en> I am not thinking here simply of the chance to remove meaningless constraints , or of the prospects for employment .
<en> I view this opportunity as a chance to give the mobile workforce credible guarantees of equal treatment .
<en> This may include , for example , positive developments over the unresolved issue of cross-border health care during the Czech Presidency .
<en> If Europe is to be without barriers , it might be good to start by not creating any new ones .
<en> Europe is not only the European Community ; Europe also encompasses our neighbours , who belong not only geographically but also historically to Europe .
<en> I would like to know your opinion on this topic , as well as the strategy the Presidency will apply to our neighbours along the borders of the European Union .
<en> I am thinking mainly of Serbia and the sensitive issue of Kosovo , and I am also thinking particularly of Moldova , which has taken many positive steps towards closer relations with the European Community .
<en> In my view , not creating barriers also entails a principled but European policy towards Russia and China .
<en> It is necessary to seek a balanced relationship with these countries too , especially where European interests are involved .
<en> Europe without Barriers also means paying serious attention to the fact that numerous minorities are to be found within the territory of the EU .
<en> This includes one minority we are reluctant to discuss in this Parliament , namely the non-citizens in some states of the European Union .
<en> The key to addressing these issues hinges , inter alia , on the introduction of a new policy , in other words in eliminating the policy of double standards .
<en> You have said that freedom and decision-making are of fundamental importance .
<en> Give the citizens of your own country a chance to decide in a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon and the siting of the US radar installation .
<en> This will confirm the sincerity of your words .
<sp>
<en> - ( FR ) Madam President , on behalf of my Independence and Democracy Group , I should like respectfully to welcome the Czech Presidency , and to do so by expressing the high regard in which we hold it , for the Czech people have experienced some great hardships and are better equipped than many of us to understand the value and the meaning of the word freedom .
<en> I should also like to welcome it by expressing our hopes .
<en> Mr Topolánek , Mr Klaus , you represent two hopes for us : listening to the voice of the people , that is , ensuring that the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon is respected throughout Europe , and giving the people back their freedom in order to free them from the Brussels bureaucracy that is swamping us .
<en> Today more and more of us , the peoples of Europe , are Brussels dissidents .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) I would first of all like to congratulate my fellow Members for this fact-finding mission to one of the most perilous regions in the world and certainly one of the most disadvantaged .
<en> I also think that the Horn of Africa is possibly the poorest region in the world .
<en> Ethiopia has suffered a disaster as a result of the drought over the last few years .
<en> It is a country where millions of people suffer from hunger , even during years where there is a rich harvest .
<en> Sudan and the Darfur region , in particular , are also tragic locations on the world map due to a humanitarian disaster , which has been described by many experts as outright genocide , as a result of the slaughter of more than two million people , while four million are refugees from the civil war .
<en> Somalia , Eritrea and Djibouti are three of the poorest countries where conflict is a permanent reality , just as you have actually highlighted , Commissioner , and my fellow Members before that .
<en> The constant instability in the region is one of the causes of the problems which the Horn of Africa is facing during the process of economic , social and political development .
<en> The success of the peace process in the region is closely linked to the involvement of regional and African structures , such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development or the African Union .
<en> The European Union must support the consolidation of these organisations , along with an increase in their ability to prevent and resolve conflicts .
<en> Better regional integration would also facilitate a more open dialogue between the countries in the Horn of Africa on subjects of common interest , such as migration , arms trafficking , energy or natural resources , and would provide a basis for dialogues on controversial topics .
<en> The European Union must , of course , get involved more when it comes to human rights violations .
<en> According to the Cotonou Agreement , these countries need to reach an agreement with the European Union with regard to observing the rule of law , human rights and democratic principles .
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , on the morning of Sunday 23 September 2001 , the Swedish citizen Dawit Isaak was taken from his home in Eritrea by the country 's authorities .
<en> He was imprisoned without trial and , more than seven years later , has still not been formally charged .
<en> His crime is stated as ' having reported independent news ' .
<en> In this resolution , we have the first direct reference to Dawit Isaak .
<en> This should increase the pressure on Eritrea .
<en> It is unacceptable for an EU citizen , a Swedish journalist , to be imprisoned for years and to be harassed by a rogue regime like that in Asmara , a regime that receives aid from the EU , aid that , moreover , has increased significantly .
<en> It is now time , Commissioner , for the European Union to act and lay down conditions for this aid .
<en> The time for silent diplomacy is past .
<en> Enough is enough .
<en> The EU will not accept the trampling underfoot of fundamental human rights , the murder or imprisonment of journalists and critics of the regime , while the population is oppressed and starving .
<en> The European Parliament is today demanding that Dawit Isaak and the other journalists imprisoned in Eritrea be released immediately .
<en> This is a powerful step in the right direction .
<en> Now the Commission and the Council must also lend force to these words .
<en> It is therefore high time that the EU entered into negotiations and introduced sanctions .
<sp>
<en> ( SV ) Mr President , like my fellow Member from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , I would like to highlight the issue of the release of Dawit Isaak .
<en> For seven years , the Swedish citizen Dawit Isaak has been imprisoned without trial in a prison cell in a terrible dictatorship .
<en> I am pleased that we have included a passage on his immediate release in the resolution on the Horn of Africa .
<en> We require the immediate release of Dawit Isaak , as well as all of the other imprisoned journalists .
<en> No trial , and what was their crime ?
<en> Well , it was working for democracy and for the freedom of speech .
<en> The EU 's future aid to Eritrea must be linked to clear demands for the release of Dawit Isaak and the other journalists .
<en> Conditional aid , together with sanctions , the freezing of Eritrean assets in Europe and the reporting of this violation of international law to the International Court of Justice are what we need today .
<en> The Swedish Government has worked using silent diplomacy , it has been said , but , after seven years , still nothing has happened .
<en> Now it is time to act .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the Horn of Africa is pretty much an unmitigated disaster .
<en> The region has been devastated by decades of war , famine , environmental degradation , corruption , mismanagement and political repression .
<en> Human rights are abused as a matter of course .
<en> Civil society is weak .
<en> Alarmingly , the situation could easily deteriorate further .
<en> Tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea over disputed territory are still likely to flare up at any moment .
<en> The failed state of Somalia remains infected by clan violence and Islamist extremism , which will worsen as Ethiopia now withdraws its troops and with the resignation of the recent President .
<en> We have also debated the epidemic of piracy off the Somali coast .
<en> There is , of course , always a temptation by the EU to suggest military action as a panacea to the chaos in the Horn of Africa .
<en> Past experience suggests this would be a terrible mistake .
<en> President Bill Clinton sent US troops to tame Somalia , but that was a disaster too .
<en> The one oasis of optimism , in my view , is in the region of Somaliland , which was formerly a British Protectorate .
<en> It was absorbed into the Somali Republic in 1960 after foolishly voluntarily relinquishing its brief period of independence , but split away again in the chaos following the death of Siad Barre in 1991 .
<en> Ever since then , Somaliland has been the only cohesive and functional polity in Somalia .
<en> The people of Somaliland benefit from a relatively benign government and progressive institutions .
<en> They also possess symbols of statehood such as a separate currency and a flag .
<en> Speaking personally , and not for my party or my political group , perhaps it is time for the international community , led by the African Union , to begin considering more seriously Somaliland 's quest for independence .
<en> An independent Somaliland , supported by the West , could be a force for stability and progress in an otherwise hopeless and chaotic region .
<en> Certainly , the people of Somaliland would be justified in asking why we here in the EU were so reluctant to recognise their de facto country , but were so quick to recognise the independence of Kosovo .
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) The European Union really has every good reason to be concerned by the situation created in Somalia where a power vacuum has virtually formed which has every chance of being filled by Somali Islamic militia .
<en> Apart from withdrawing the three thousand Ethiopian troops , the missions under the auspices of the African Union could also withdraw if they do not receive additional support during the subsequent period .
<en> I could not describe the European mission patrolling the waters in the region as anything other than a resounding success , but this task only involves treating the effects of the ' disease ' , and not at all the disease itself .
<en> Somalia must have a government capable of acting as a dialogue partner for the international institutions , European Union and all the other states willing to assume an active role in bringing stability to this region .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( RO ) The massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995 , along with all the atrocities committed during the war which accompanied the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia , are a black page in Europe 's history .
<en> There is a tragic lesson from history which allows us to understand once again the need to develop the ability to take effective action in the European Union , in its external security and defence policy and especially in its European Neighbourhood Policy .
<en> Why ?
<en> Precisely so that we can combat issues such as the violation of human rights and the principles of international law , regional conflicts , nationalist extremism and ethnic separatism , which have all made possible the atrocities in Bosnia .
<en> Europe needs a stronger , more expansive European Union , with a policy of prevention which will not allow such atrocities to ever happen again .
<sp>
<en> President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , let me conclude today 's debate on Srebrenica .
<en> First of all , I want to assure you that the Council remains determined that the perpetrators of crimes in Srebrenica , in Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as elsewhere in the region of the Western Balkans , must be brought to justice .
<en> Our ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to provide support and assistance to the ICTY and relevant authorities .
<en> Srebrenica is , and will remain , a sensitive and important factor in the political life of Bosnia and Herzegovina and also of the EU and wider international community .
<en> Let me use this opportunity to call upon the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to refrain from abusing this painful and unspeakable historical experience for their political purposes .
<en> They should , rather , engage proactively to lead their country towards a better future .
<en> There is a need to continue joint efforts , not just in Srebrenica but in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole .
<en> If Srebrenica happened because there was not enough European spirit , then we should do our utmost to help this country embark on the right path .
<en> This means towards the EU .
<en> The first big step towards Europe was already achieved with signing the SAA agreement as the beginning of a long accession process , but much more is needed , more courage and confidence , to strive for wholehearted reconciliation underpinned by tangible prospects of integration .
<en> We all have the obligation to the dead not to make victims out of the living .
<en> This is our obligation for generations to come .
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Mr President , Mrs Ibrisagic , I was one of those people watching on television when these terrible things happened .
<en> We all thought that safe havens would be safe havens .
<en> So I was , like many others , terribly shocked when we heard what had happened - or slowly experienced the reality .
<en> In the European Union , I think we have only learned by hard lessons what we have to do , and we then slowly started the Common foreign and security policy .
<en> This was the first item , so to speak , and we have then gone on because we saw that this terrible massacre happened because we were not united .
<en> Once again , I can only pay tribute to you for being here today and speaking so openly for reconciliation .
<en> For those who live with that memory , it must be very difficult , but at the same time I think that the possibility of Bosnia and Herzegovina becoming a member of the European Union in the future is perhaps something that can aid reconciliation with all these terrible atrocities .
<sp>
<en> I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote on the resolution will take place tomorrow ( Thursday 15 January 2009 ) .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various EU Member States .
<sp>
<en> author suppleant . - Madam President , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , I would like to set out what is at stake here .
<en> It is about production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various European Member States .
<en> The European Union and China have agreed to a joint surveillance system relating to exports of certain categories of textile and clothing products from China to European Member States , but this system expired on 31 December 2008 .
<en> During the last two years , 350 000 jobs have been lost , and the number of companies was reduced by 5 % during the same period .
<en> In the light of the growing number of enterprises that are ceasing to operate , or relocating production , leading to an increase of unemployment in several regions , I would like to put the following questions on behalf of the International Trade Committee :
<en> Has the Commission or any Member State proposed or requested the extension of the dual surveillance mechanism beyond 31 December 2008 or any other measures in that framework ?
<en> What measures does the Commission intend to adopt to protect production and employment in the textile and clothing sector ?
<en> Will the Commission continue to monitor real-time market developments , import statistics and customs monitoring and keep the sector informed of the latest developments ?
<en> What is the current situation regarding the proposed regulation on ' made in ' labels ?
<en> What measures have been taken by the Commission to address the proposals adopted by Parliament in its resolution of 13 December 2007 ?
<sp>
<en> Member of the Commission . - Madam President , it is understandable in this climate that there is concern about the success of manufacturing in the face of competition , and of course textiles are very important .
<en> Employment has continued to drop and production has fallen again - and that is after a couple of years of relative stability .
<en> Of course the sector is at the cutting edge of globalisation .
<en> Small and medium-sized enterprises play a huge part in this .
<en> Following the end of the Memorandum of Understanding in 2005 , we did have the agreement on the joint surveillance system - to which Mrs Wortmann-Kool drew our attention - and it has given us early information about trade flows .
<en> We are therefore better able to react in the event of being faced with a sudden surge in our industry .
<en> It is also a further step in the transition to open markets designed and developed - as I am sure Members know - with the economic players concerned and in discussion with Member States and with Parliament .
<en> By promoting a process of gradual change , we have helped the sector adapt .
<en> That has been supported by the social partners .
<en> They did not ask for an extension of the voluntary growth levels under the Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ) when it ended in 2008 , nor have they been asking for a continuation of the surveillance system into 2009 - though I appreciate that some Member States would have preferred us to do so .
<en> Imports from China have increased overall , but within reasonable limits .
<en> Significant increases in some categories - such as for example dresses , trousers and pullovers - have been balanced by drops in textile imports from suppliers in other countries .
<en> So , overall in 2008 , only a slight overall increase was realised and markets have absorbed that reasonably well .
<en> The right political responses are not to close our markets or monitoring of the imports .
<en> We need to ensure that all businesses can change , adapt , trade and innovate out of current conditions .
<en> It is precisely to help businesses like this that the economic recovery plan was endorsed .
<en> That , of course , represents a huge boost of 1.5 % of EU GDP , which should help the textile and clothing sector .
<en> The challenges for the sector predate the current slowdown .
<en> Eight of the fifteen applications under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund have been to support textile workers .
<en> The Commission is ready to support initiatives to set up partnerships in the textile and clothing sector designed to anticipate restructuring with the aim of protecting employment and , overall , the sector benefits from the fact that there is a long-standing framework for social dialogue .
<en> We welcome Parliament 's resolution on the future of the textile sector .
<en> We move forward in market access , in funds from the Lead Market Initiative , and in every free trade agreement , as causes dedicated to environmental and social standards .
<en> Of course currency devaluation remains on our agenda .
<sp>
<2en> Madam President , textiles and clothing are a globalised sector of the economy par excellence , a sector which is characterised by continual change in terms of the place of production and constant restructurings and adjustments to new situations , such as the liberalisation of international trade .
<2en> For many Member States of the European Union , including Greece , this sector is an important source of exports and employment .
<2en> However , the considerable number of production units relocating and the constant reduction in employment have taken on worrying dimensions .
<2en> In addition to structural problems , the acute discrepancy between the import tariffs of the European Union , on the one hand , and of its most important competitors , on the other hand , is playing a negative role .
<2en> Commissioner , we are talking about a sector which represents an extremely high percentage of overall seizures of pirated products on the borders of the European Union , a percentage which is constantly rising .
<2en> In this instance , I consider the proposal to set up a European observatory on pirated products to be a good idea , so that we can achieve better coordination between the competent authorities , Member States and Commission services and also conditions of effective cooperation with the private sector .
<2en> I think we need to adopt regulations on the ' made in ' label , which will help to safeguard conditions of fair competition and consumer protection .
<2en> The establishment of more effective rules of origin is important in terms of the application of tariff quotas within the framework of the generalised tariff preferences and regional agreements .
<2en> We are being called upon to shape a new framework of cooperative relations between the agencies that implement industrial and regional policy and commitments and to effectively support European undertakings , especially small and medium-sized enterprises , so that they can maintain and further improve their competitive specialisation .
<2en> I refer to the production of high added value products in terms of quality and design , innovation and the use of new technologies .
<sp>
<2en> We would like to thank you for your replies to the oral questions .
<2en> I would like to stress that , as is well-known , the textile sector makes a particularly important contribution to the GDP of all the Member States , including Romania .
<2en> We are well aware that this sector creates new jobs , especially for the female workforce .
<2en> I agree with and support the measures which you are proposing because , being aware of how important trade is in the current economic crisis , we need to realise how important the measures are which we need to take to protect jobs .
<2en> Bearing in mind that the joint surveillance system for textile imports from China was stopped at the end of last year , which I understand was an important tool for monitoring the market , I would like to suggest to the Commission that it attaches greater importance not only to the textile sector but also to other vulnerable industrial sectors such as steel , chemicals and machines .
<2en> I would also like to suggest that the European Commission presents on a regular basis impact studies , statistical data or other elements and relevant instruments for these sectors .
<2en> I would like to congratulate you once again on the measures you have proposed for access , free trade , funds and the environment .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Discrimination based on gender is still a reality , unfortunately , even in the European Union Member States .
<2en> This fact is not only valid in the private sector , where men account for nine-tenths of the members of boards of directors in large companies , but also in the public sector where women are also underrepresented .
<2en> However , the Lisbon Strategy aims to ensure that 60 % of women able to work are in employment .
<2en> Apart from this , we must not forget that one of the biggest challenges in Europe in the medium- and long-term is the demographic situation .
<2en> The European Union is facing a bigger rise in the average age of its population than other regions of the world , along with a population growth of just 0.4 % , which means that the European Union will need , at the same time , to face up to a fall in the population able to work and an ageing population .
<2en> Consequently , the choice between having a career and raising a family must not be definitive or mandatory and it must be possible to balance these two aspects of life .
<sp>
<2en> One of the European Union 's key values is to eliminate any form of discrimination .
<2en> Apart from eliminating discrimination , which also means between men and women , we have the responsibility to implement proactive measures to encourage professional careers for women .
<2en> One of the fields in which women are hugely underrepresented is scientific research .
<2en> In addition , they are not only underrepresented in numerical terms , but also within the management hierarchy : the higher the level in the hierarchy , the lower the proportion of women .
<2en> In this way , society is depriving itself of the creative potential of an important section of the population .
<2en> The highly competitive nature of research , the inherent geographical mobility associated with scientific work , along with establishing a career at a relatively late age all make this activity difficult to combine with family life .
<2en> I am taking advantage of the discussion of this topic to highlight the need to introduce specific policies aimed at achieving equality between men and women in the academic profession .
<2en> These policies must take into account a set of good practices at European level , such as facilitating dual careers , encouraging universities and research institutes to invest in childcare centres , as well as fast-track access to academic posts for women .
<sp>
<2en> The Member States of the European Union must support demographic renewal , incorporating their action into the renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs , in line with the policy of equality between men and women .
<2en> A balance in European societies depends on the sum total of solidarity relations between the generations , which are more complex than ever before : young people continue to live in their parents ' home for longer periods , while it is increasingly common for those parents to have to look after their aging relatives as well .
<2en> The burden that this represents rests primarily on the young and middle-aged generation , and especially on women .
<2en> For this reason , equality between women and men , that is to say , equal opportunities in the broader sense , would seem to be a fundamental condition for bringing about new forms of inter-generational solidarity .
<2en> With regard to family obligations , that is , the reconciliation of family life and work , the question of equality between men and women is clearly very important if European families are to gain new impetus .
<2en> It is also of critical importance to guarantee the opportunity for childcare of appropriate quality and quantity for those who would like to take up paid employment alongside childrearing .
<2en> The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is doing everything it can to ensure that the goals of Barcelona Process are met , and notes with disappointment that this objective is visibly absent from the Czech Presidency 's programme .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Thank you Chairman !
<en> This report is important to showcase and reverse the discrimination based on gender and intergenerational solidarity !
<en> It has been pretty clear that women who chose to take time off from work to take care of their newborn child have been discriminated against .
<en> They often have trouble returning to their jobs with the same opportunities , miss out on job promotions , and lose both income and social security benefits .
<en> Furthermore , men and women who stay home for long periods of time to take care of the elderly or young children often lose out economically because they don 't have an income and their work is not factored into the GDP even though it is important work .
<en> This work often goes ignored by policy makers and society as a whole .
<en> People look down upon people who chose to stay home instead of work because they feel as if they are not contributing to society .
<en> Ladies and Gentlemen !
<en> The EU should promote policies that eliminate this discriminatory mindset and give people who chose to stay home to take care of a family member more leave arrangements and more support .
<en> These policies should be funded by the public purse as to lessen the likelihood that employers ' will discriminate against their employees !
<en> Thank you !
<sp>
<2en> Today 's Europe is faced with unprecedented demographic changes .
<2en> If Europe wishes to change the trend towards population reduction , we must , through the policy of the EU and the Member States , support families in all possible ways , and permit women and men to combine family life and work , but such that obligations connected with home and family are equally divided between men and women .
<2en> I wholeheartedly support the alternative motion for a European Parliament resolution on non-discrimination based on gender and inter-generational solidarity , which is more realistic than the preceding report .
<2en> I must particularly emphasise the objective of creating a care policy that is balanced between the genders .
<2en> Inequality in the performance of caring is often caused by the absence of affordable , available and high-quality services in Member States , and women are faced with the inevitability of sacrificing their opportunities to participate in social , economic and political life .
<2en> All of this preserves the inequality in the distribution of obligations connected with home and family between men and women , which generally forces women to choose a more flexible organisation of labour or give up working , which in turn influences their career , the continuing disparity between the wages earned by women and men , and pension rights .
<2en> I am cautious of the recommendation of the Czech Presidency to make childcare ' a fully valid alternative to a professional career ' .
<2en> I am convinced that the implementation of this recommendation would perpetuate the traditional division of labour between men and women .
<2en> The measures planned in the framework of the Lisbon Strategy play an important role in establishing equality in the division of labour between women and men ; their objective , in addition to increasing employment , promoting innovation and raising productivity , must also be to eliminate in the EU the gender discrimination that has developed over time .

<en> As I did not interpret the Member 's speech in the manner in which you have just claimed , I did not resort to the powers which are conferred on me under the Rules of Procedure .

<en> ( ES ) Mr President , given that I have been mentioned , I stand by each and every one of the words I have spoken .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , the example of Spain was just raised , but it is , in fact , the Spanish State that has actually dealt with the problem .
<2en> The Commission is aware of the specific circumstances in which the Russian-speaking minority in Latvia find themselves .
<2en> A great deal of effort was made as part of the pre-accession strategy to promote the naturalisation and integration of these people , in line with the recommendations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and of the Council of Europe .
<2en> The Commission has repeatedly emphasised that all the parties involved , including the minority themselves , need to contribute to this complex process and to come up with solutions .
<2en> With regard to the specific issue of the participation of non-Latvian citizens in local elections , all that the Treaty establishing the European Community guarantees , in terms of electoral rights , is the participation of EU citizens in European and municipal elections in their Member State of residence , even if they are not nationals of that state .
<2en> The participation in elections of people who are not nationals of an EU country , and are therefore not EU citizens , is not an issue covered by Community law .
<2en> The Commission therefore cannot talk to Latvia regarding the issue of these people 's participation in local elections .
<2en> It is up to the Member States to decide such issues .
<2en> I do understand the situation depicted by the co-authors of the oral question , but unfortunately , I cannot give them any other answer , so we need to leave it to Latvia itself to take care of this problem , which the Union is not in a legal position to resolve .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( LV ) Thank you , Mr President , I must remind you that in my small country , Latvia , there are 2.3 million inhabitants , of whom approximately 1.6 million are of Latvian ethnic origin .
<en> Nonetheless , in Latvia , primary education is dispensed by the state and local government in eight minority languages , some of which , such as Romany and Estonian , are very small .
<en> When speaking about Russian-speaking non-citizens , one cannot use the concept of a ' traditional minority ' .
<en> In the sense of Western European countries , they could be said to be newcomers or immigrants who , at the time of the Soviet occupation , arrived in Latvia and enjoyed many privileges .
<en> Firstly , they had the privilege of not learning the language of the land and people they had come to , but of speaking only Russian .
<en> My country has enacted one of the most generous naturalisation laws in Europe , precisely in order to meet those people halfway .
<en> Over the ten-year period that this law has been in force , approximately 50 % of non-citizens have acquired citizenship rights .
<en> When a survey was conducted recently , however , in late 2008 , among people who had not become naturalised , 74 % did not wish to obtain Latvian citizenship .
<en> Secondly , only one third of non-citizens has made use of the right to register as Latvian citizens children born after Latvia regained its independence - just one third .
<en> Why that is , I do not know .
<en> Mrs Ždanoka , who was elected from Latvia and represents Latvian citizens of Russian origin , makes no secret of the fact that after obtaining voting rights for non-citizens , the next step would be to call for Russian to be given the status of a second state or official language .
<en> What does that mean ?
<en> Firstly , it means the retention of privileged status for people who came to Latvia from Russia , and secondly , it would be the signing of a [ death ] sentence for the Latvian language and culture since , behind the Russian speakers , there are 140 million more in Russia , with increasing nationalistic ambitions .
<en> For the Latvian language , it is not possible , as small as we are , as few in number as we are .
<en> Finally , we joined the European Union not in order to retain the divided society created by the Soviet occupation , but in order to overcome it and to retain our own identity .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner Barrot 's response was very disappointing .
<en> I would have expected a more positive response from him , despite the legal constraints that he operates under .
<en> I thought he might have said that he would do what he could to encourage change in Latvia in the spirit of the European Union 's principle of diversity .
<en> I am from Ireland ; I speak English .
<en> English is my mother tongue , but I am not English : I am Irish .
<en> The reality is that the European Union is made up of many states .
<en> Virtually all our states have minorities and majorities who have histories relating to being part of an empire or to being an empire or a colony .
<en> We have had to deal with that .
<en> If I moved to Latvia and lived and worked there for a while , I would be able to vote in local elections .
<en> However , there are hundreds of thousands of people in Latvia who were born in Latvia but who cannot vote in local elections .
<en> That is an injustice , but - I would tell Mr Pīks - it is also self-destructive because , in order to overcome the difficulties and the fears , we must make all of our people welcome in our states .
<en> We must encourage them to participate politically .
<en> Enabling people to vote in local elections would enable them to feel part of their community and part of the management of their own local communities and would help , as I say , to overcome barriers .
<en> One of the largest migrant communities in Ireland is British .
<en> They can all vote in local elections in Ireland .
<en> They cannot all vote in national elections because they do not all hold Irish citizenship , but they all vote in Irish local elections and make a very important contribution to Irish political life .
<en> So I would appeal to those in this House who are from Latvia - and indeed from any other of our Member States that have minority , or even majority , problems - to bear in mind that , in order to overcome these difficulties and to overcome fear , we have to make people welcome and incorporate them into our political process , not keep them out of it .

<en> in writing . - ( SV ) This report contains several points that I fully support , such as the fact that asylum seekers should be treated with dignity and that human rights should always be guaranteed .
<en> The criticism directed at a number of so-called reception centres is justified .
<en> A number of European countries fall short when it comes to receiving asylum seekers and refugees in a dignified way .
<en> However , the report contains some points that I am unable to support .
<en> The essential aim of the report is that the EU should have a common immigration and asylum policy .
<en> Among other things , it calls on the other Member States to support those EU countries that are ' most affected by the challenges of immigration ' .
<en> The June List believes that asylum and immigration policy is a matter for the Member States , provided that international conventions and agreements are respected .
<en> A common immigration and asylum policy would run the risk of leading to ' Fortress Europe ' , something that we are already seeing clear signs of today .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I abstained in the vote on this report as Ireland did not participate in the adoption of the 2003 Directive .
<en> The principal reason for this position relates to access to the labour market for asylum seekers .
<en> The prohibition on asylum seekers entering the labour market is to be re-enacted in a bill currently before the Dáil .
<sp>
<2en> The report does not reflect the true extent of the miserable conditions experienced by refugees and immigrants in the reception and detention centres in the Member States of the EU .
<2en> It confines itself to noting the tragic conditions in which they survive , but ascribes them to the poor application of EU directives .
<2en> Thus , on the one hand , it supports the overall anti-immigration legislation and policy of the EU and governments , as laid down in the Immigration Pact and the Dublin System for asylum and , on the other , it protests about its inhumane results .
<2en> It is , at the very least , insulting for the political powers of the ' one-way street ' in Europe who voted in the European Parliament for the directive providing , apart from anything else , for the detention of ' illegal ' immigrants for a full 18 months , to express in this report their alleged regret about their inhumane conditions of detention and to call for them not to be detained .
<2en> The European Parliament 's ' crocodile tears ' cannot acquit the EU of its inhumane , exploitative policy .
<2en> Even the most fundamental measures , let alone measures of proper support for immigrants and refugees and measures to safeguard their rights , can only be implemented by confronting and overturning the policy of the EU and the structure of the EU itself .
<sp>
<2en> The Member States , including Greece , need to do more , by making use of the demands and proposals of the European Parliament .
<2en> The European Parliament blames the governments ' attitude towards the poor immigrants who pass daily through the gates of the EU , putting their lives at risk .
<2en> Countries , such as Greece , which lie on the external borders of the EU , should take advantage of the potential assistance offered by the EU and , on the basis of respect for the rights of refugees and asylum seekers , try to secure humane conditions of reception for them .
<2en> Even with the unacceptable ' discounts ' which the Commission and the Council have been granting recently with respect to immigrants ' rights as they continue on their path towards ' Fortress Europe ' , Greece is well below Community standards for the protection of fundamental rights .
<sp>
<2en> The granting of asylum is the ultimate gesture of a state and an entire community , accepting their inability to defend human rights globally and the will , nevertheless , to act according to that scale of values .
<2en> The system governing it must therefore be clearly separate from immigration .
<2en> The more we try to broaden the concept , including what is not relevant to it , the less value it will have , and the confusion can only harm legitimate asylum seekers .
<2en> It is therefore important for the rules to be clear , the procedures swift , and treatment dignified in all circumstances .
<2en> Even though there is a need to coordinate actions and options , asylum , in terms of numbers , size and in conceptual terms , does not raise the same issues as immigration , even in an area without borders .
<2en> The Member States have their own traditions with regard to asylum and this difference should not be overlooked within the framework of the aforementioned coordination .
<2en> As for asylum seekers whose application is or has to be refused , this concept , the result of a generous but narrow notion of asylum , cannot give rise to any less humanity in the reception and treatment of people who will always be vulnerable by virtue of their condition .

<en> on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I apologise for interrupting the vote .
<en> Under Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure , I am asking the Members of the House to postpone the vote on the Onesta report with regard to the petitions process , as this matter is at present being dealt with in the Conference of Presidents in the context of the reform of the procedures of the House .
<en> The Conference of Presidents will discuss the very specific reform issues dealt with in the Onesta report at a meeting on 5 March 2009 , and I am asking that , if possible , the vote on this report be postponed until the Strasbourg part-session in the second week of March .

<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( FR ) Madam President , let us try to be precise .
<en> This report amends our regulation , or rather clarifies it , in order to make it clear how petitions to the Committee on Petitions are received or not received , how information is given to petitioners , and so on .
<en> It was approved unanimously , with one vote against I think , in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
<en> I do not think , therefore , that this report is very controversial .
<en> There is , however , one article in which we had agreed to make it clear that if and when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force , petitioners would simply be informed if a petition that were submitted not to Parliament but to the European Commission - you know , those petitions with millions of signatures - were connected to their petition .
<en> If I understand rightly , it is that article , because of the reference to a possible future treaty that causes a problem .
<en> Personally , I can live with postponing it until 5 March ; I can even live with a ' speed vote ' withdrawing that amendment .
<en> On the other hand , it would be very regrettable if we could not tidy up our regulation on this point when there have been so many problems in the past .
<en> I am in your hands , ladies and gentlemen .

<en> ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in Italy , the Communications Regulatory Authority , an independent body , has issued its 43rd resolution against the state television authority for breaching the rights of Italian citizens to be informed about initiatives by the Radicals - its 43rd resolution .
<en> In Italy , since the elections - ten months ago now - there have been no electoral debates broadcast ; they have been illegally suspended .
<en> The Italian parliament 's supervisory committee on radio and television is not meeting , which is also against the law .
<en> This problem is not just about Mr Berlusconi : it is about a system of the Right , Centre and Left that is infringing the civil and political rights of Italian citizens .
<en> Mr Pannella and I must leave our work tomorrow and hasten to Italy to try and create forms of non-violent resistance against this new form of denial of democracy .
<en> We shall send a message to all our fellow Members to explain in detail the nature of these infringements and to ask for your support and assistance .
<sp>
<en> ( PL ) Madam President , once again in this Chamber I am forced to speak up for the rights of national minorities in Lithuania , which are being ruthlessly broken and violated by the Lithuanian authorities and judicial system .
<en> In the region around Vilnius over 70 % of the population are Polish .
<en> Until now , the names of streets and towns were bilingual , as they are in many countries of the European Union with national minorities .
<en> Not long ago , the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania judged the placing of street name signs in Polish alongside signs with Lithuanian names to be illegal , and ordered their removal .
<en> The local government in Vilnius has implemented this decision - the Polish street names in the region where most residents are from the Polish minority have been removed .
<en> This is not acceptable in a country which has been a member of the European Union for five years .
<en> It is a symptom of extreme nationalism , shows a lack of respect for the rights of national minorities and is a violation of the fundamental principles on which the European Union is built .
<en> I call upon the Lithuanian authorities to restore the Polish names of streets and towns in regions where most residents are part of the Polish minority .
<sp>
<en> ( EL ) Madam President , terrorism against workers with the support of repressive state mechanisms is now a standard approach in the slave workplace .
<en> Thousands of workers are being made redundant and workers ' fundamental labour and social rights are being cut to fit to the Procrustean bed .
<en> One typical example is in the United Kingdom , where it has been discovered that a private company is collecting information about workers ' trade union , social and political activities and selling it to companies .
<en> In Greece the labour disputes to have laid-off workers reinstated has been labelled illegal and abusive .
<en> The workers are obviously determined to defend their rights and have adopted as their standard the words of the 22-year-old worker Nikos Nikopoulos in his open letter to the public prosecutor to the Supreme Court of Appeal in Greece , in which he says , among other things :
<en> ' There are certain things in this life for me which cannot be bought or sold .
<en> I prefer my wage to be my inalienable right , to claim the riches which I produce and which belong to me .
<en> My intransigent refusal to be bribed or terrorised has caused me to be dismissed for a second time .
<en> I received direct threats against my life and the life of my family . '
<en> This statement truly illustrates the will of and the path being taken by the workers .
<en> ( The President cut off the speaker )
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) In recent days , perhaps partly on account of the crisis , popular opinion in the Member States that acceded in the last five years has responded with increasing sensitivity to any step that might call into question or discredit the equal status and identical standards of their membership within the Union .
<en> As regards my own electoral district , we have heard accusations on Swedish television and then on the internet that , in the village of Harkakötöny , the way geese are plucked constitutes cruelty to animals , whereas , in fact , no geese have been bred there or in the place mentioned for years .
<en> I am glad that a charge of libel has been filed regarding this matter .
<en> Similar libellous statements were made recently against breeders in my country concerning force-feeding of geese .
<en> These statements called for a boycott against the processors that has caused economic damages .
<en> Interestingly , no such accusations have been levelled against the old Member States .
<en> These are actions taken out of economic interest , but another , uniquely political form of defamation consists of statements alleging ethnically-based attacks against the Roma population in Hungary as if these were matters of fact , although to date it has for the most part been impossible to provide proof that such attacks have indeed taken place .
<en> I ask the Commission to monitor such polemics closely and especially not to spread them , since such statements could seriously discredit the European Union 's prestige in my country in the run-up to the elections .
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Madam President , as our Parliament 's permanent rapporteur for humanitarian action , I have just returned from Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo and I had hoped to give you an optimistic message about the resolution of this situation and the return of displaced persons to their homes .
<en> Unfortunately , my optimism has been dampened by the decision taken by President El Béchir concerning the biggest humanitarian crisis , that of Darfur .
<en> True , President El Béchir , it is correct to postpone it as it is in fact a fight against impunity , and it is right to ensure respect for international humanitarian law .
<en> However , President El Béchir has just increased the evidence against him by taking a decision which is ill-conceived on two counts : first , because it adds to the grievances already lodged against him and , secondly , because this on its own could be brought before the International Criminal Court as the consequences for Darfur are extraordinarily serious on a humanitarian level .
<en> The world then will not forget , but mere words will have little effect , Madam President .
<en> I realise that we were changing the issue , but we must go beyond mere words and turn to action .

<en> ( EL ) Madam President , the Commission proposal for a directive to abolish discrimination has come up against the opposition of many European citizens and , as a result , they are in the difficult position of doubting the validity of such a proposal , which touches on their right to decide on matters for which the European Union is not competent through their own state .
<en> As we approach the European elections , I think that we should not raise such issues .
<en> The abolition of symbols , the abolition of the right to decide on life belongs to each state .
<en> At a time when the European Parliament is abolishing structures through which its MEPs can express themselves freely , such as cross-party groups , we cannot talk about abolishing discrimination .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , a month ago you and I paid our second visit of the year to Gaza .
<en> Others have trod in our footsteps - Javier Solana has been there , Tony Blair has finally made it , and the President of Parliament has been there to see for himself the circumstances in which Palestinians are now living .
<en> This Parliament asked for the economic blockade to be lifted , but , to a very large extent , it continues .
<en> Week after week , the collective punishment of Palestinian people is maintained by the Israelis .
<en> Our words are fine , but they have little value while Israel refuses to listen .
<en> Madam Vice-President , I ask you to ask the President to call a meeting of the group leaders and his cabinet to consider how our words can be turned into deeds .
<en> I face the question all the time from my constituents : ' You have an Association Agreement with Israel .
<en> How is it that we maintain this relationship with one side , while that party ignores our interests and treats our words with such contempt ? '
<sp>

<en> ( RO ) European values are especially important to the education system in Romania .
<en> The election speeches from our fellow Members , László Tőkés , Csaba Sógor and Iulius Winkler , sometimes lose touch with reality .
<en> Romania offers ethnic minorities wide-ranging instruction in their mother tongue .
<en> I would like to highlight the important role that the state Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca plays in the provision of Hungarian-medium education .
<en> The multi-cultural organisational system set up through Babeş-Bolyai University 's Charter in 1995 ensures complete , independent instruction in Romanian , Hungarian and German , as well as Jewish studies , at every level of academic qualification .
<en> A number of signs and inscriptions in Hungarian and German are on display at Babeş-Bolyai University .
<en> Seventeen faculties currently offer programmes of study in Romanian and Hungarian , with 11 faculties offering courses in Romanian and German .
<en> There are also two faculties , Reformed Theology and Roman Catholic Theology , where the programmes of study are taught exclusively in Hungarian .
<sp>
<en> ( SL ) I warmly welcome today 's decision by the Croatian government to respond positively , in principle , to the European Commission 's initiative for mediation between Slovenia and Croatia .
<en> Unfortunately , the positive response also includes an unnecessary rider , a condition which significantly reduces the possibility of mediation .
<en> However , it is important that we work together to create the conditions which will allow mediation to commence as soon as possible , which will defuse the political climate in both countries and enable dialogue to take place on better terms .
<en> We must further promote the process of enlargement of the European Union and this is why we need the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> Time is of the essence and I therefore hope that a framework mediation agreement will be drawn up shortly .

<2en> Mr President , I voted in favour of Mrs Gibault 's report on equality of treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts .
<2en> I agree with the aims of Mrs Gibault 's report : to recognise the way in which identities are constructed socially and culturally in the performing arts and to propose specific solutions which could correct the imbalances associated with existing unequal situations .
<2en> All available skills sources should be used for the good health of the sector as well as for the personal development of men and women .
<2en> Lastly , I feel that it is imperative to find solutions very quickly for opening crèches in cultural undertakings with hours adapted to rehearsal and performance times .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , I support Mr Schwab 's report on CO2 emissions and improving road safety .
<2en> It is essential that the efforts to reduce CO2 emissions do not undermine other equally important aspects of car design , and do not negatively affect road safety .
<2en> I believe that stimulating and investing in the development of an innovative European motor industry will effectively enable us to protect jobs in this sector , which has been worst hit by the financial crisis .
<sp>
<2en> Now there are new technologies to fundamentally improve transport safety ( e.g. electronic stability control systems ) or to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions ( e.g. low rolling resistance tyres ) , if such technologies are fitted as standard in new motor vehicles .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - MEP Schwab has proposed a report which aims to increase car safety through the introduction of increased safety measures requirements for car manufacturers .
<en> All new vehicles manufactured in the Union will be subject to compliance with the technical requirements and measures which will reduce their environmental impact , decrease associated noise pollution and increase their road safety .
<en> The regulation combines advances in European manufacturing and technology and increased levels of safety protection that the European consumer can expect .
<en> These innovations will help to reduce CO2 emissions , fuel consumption and noise pollution .
<en> I am delighted to support this report which will benefit us all .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of this report , as consumers need and want safer and more environmentally-friendly vehicles .
<2en> As for car safety , I particularly welcome the mandatory fitting of ESP ( electronic stability systems ) in passenger cars from as early as those built in 2011 .
<2en> As far as tyres are concerned , I believe the efforts to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of better tyres with less rolling resistance , as well as the introduction of electronic tyre pressure monitoring systems , to be worthwhile .
<2en> The reduction of CO2 emissions must not , however , be at the expense of the safety of the tyres , which is to say , their wet grip .
<2en> I am also pleased that existing stocks will not - as originally planned - have to be taken off the market within 12 months , but instead only 30 months after the introduction of a new standard .
<2en> This avoids the need for tyre stocks to be destroyed , which would cause additional damage to the environment .
<2en> Furthermore , we are allowing our supply businesses , hard hit , as they have been , by the economic crisis , a sufficient transitional period to get to grips with the high level of requirements made of them .

<en> ( RO ) We have a saying in Romania : a well-bred man is said to have had his ' first seven years at home ' .

<en> In many Member States , schools offer facilities for teaching the language of the country of residence .
<en> Indeed , in some Member States , families who were living illegally have been able to make their situation legal if they had children registered at school , and have even received social housing .
<en> Children are the most precious thing that society has and it is our duty to provide them with conditions conducive to their harmonious development .
<en> Formal education , affection , children 's integration in society are essential conditions allowing social Europe to offer equal chances to all its citizens .

<en> ( SK ) When workers emigrate , children often become the victims of their families ' improved financial circumstances .
<en> The former Czechoslovak Republic experienced a great wave of emigration in the inter-war period , chiefly to the United States .
<en> However , these were migrants living in conditions of extreme poverty at home .
<en> And even if the children remained temporarily in the care of one parent , this would usually only be for a limited period of time .
<en> In today 's consumer society and with family relationships under threat , there are considerably more tragic cases .
<en> It is often not extreme poverty that motivates parents to work abroad .
<en> One or both parents often never return and they can be indifferent to the fate of their children , whose best hope is to be cared for by close relatives .
<en> We should keep this aspect in mind in relation to regional development policy and we should strive to eliminate regional variations , particularly in the new Member States .
<sp>
<2en> Ladies and gentlemen , I think that the debate has clearly shown that this is an important topic which we must work on , regardless of whether or not , at a given moment , there may be sufficiently detailed information available for us to reach a final opinion .
<2en> After all , the facts that are known are sufficiently compelling for it to be clear that we must address the question and take an active approach .
<2en> I have stated that the Commission has already prepared some studies , one of which will be completed by the end of this year .
<2en> I think it is also clear that the main part of the response and the main part of the reaction must come from the Member States , as family policy is generally a matter for Member States .
<2en> Undoubtedly , of course , there are possibilities for the EU itself because questions which relate to migrant workers also relate to their social security , the transfer of social contributions and a range of other issues .
<2en> So my answer to your question would be that it is , above all , a matter for the Member States , but the EU does have a role to play and one which , in my opinion , is by no means insignificant .
<sp>

<en> ( DE ) Mr President , this report sends an important signal to a country that is playing a stabilising role , has exemplary legislation on minorities , has a broad government majority in which all nationalities are represented and has taken a clear European course under the leadership of Prime Minister Gruevski .
<en> I therefore gladly voted in favour of this report , and I believe that we should emphasise two points in particular : firstly , we want the Council and the Commission to tell us this year when accession negotiations are to begin and , secondly , we will not tolerate any bilateral troublemaking , and definitely not with regard to this bizarre name issue .
<en> The country is called Macedonia , whether that suits some people or not , and we must finally start to smooth this country 's way towards Europe .
<sp>
<en> ( NL ) Mr President , I voted against Mr Meijer 's report because I , and my party , are of the opinion that enlargement must be brought to a halt for an indeterminate period after the accession of Croatia .
<en> European citizens want nothing to do with any further enlargement in the short or medium term , and certainly nothing to do with an enlargement to include Turkey , of course .
<en> Yet it is time that this Parliament listened , for once , to those it is supposed to represent .
<en> That being the case , I also oppose the commencement of accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , which this Parliament is calling for , as well as the granting of a European perspective to the entire Western Balkans .
<en> Some of these countries or entities are Islamic through and through and , as far as I am concerned , should not be allowed to join the European Union .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , I was very pleased with the vote today .
<en> I visited Macedonia very recently , on behalf of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy , set up by Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister of my country , and saw a country with vibrant political parties and a fascinating tax policy , with flat taxes on both corporation and income tax , and a growing economy .
<en> It is a country that this coming month is going to have free , fair and honest elections - probably better than the ones we recently had in the UK , with postal votes .
<en> Such a country should be allowed to join the European Union , should it choose to , based on its own self-determination - which is why my previous colleagues should possibly reflect on this matter .
<en> Today we have seen a significant change because , up until this point , Greek Members of this House have been making themselves look completely absurd , and have been placed in a position of ridicule because of their arguments about the name of this country , which is the Republic of Macedonia .
<sp>
<en> Mr President , the problem with speaking after Mr Heaton Harris is that he has made many of the same points I wanted to make on this issue .
<en> It seems to me blatantly absurd that Greece should continue to pursue this long-standing and , frankly , ridiculous tirade against the name of Macedonia .
<en> I have some beautiful counties in my constituency - Durham , Northumberland - and it really does not bother me too much if another Member State wishes to give itself the names of those fantastic counties .
<en> For the accession negotiations to be held up not because of an ethnic dispute or a democratic dispute or a human rights dispute but purely because the country decides to name itself Macedonia , is patently ridiculous .
<en> I hope that the Greek Members will see the sense of this .
<en> I hope that Macedonia will be judged on free criteria that apply to everybody else and , if they fulfil those criteria , if they are a democratic , secular state , if they pursue the right human rights policies then , like all other Member States , they should have the right to join and not be subject to a ridiculous veto by Greece purely on the grounds of the name .

<en> Mr President , the Tamil Tigers have been designated a terrorist group by the EU and by the United States , but thankfully it looks as though their bloodthirsty campaign for an independent Tamil homeland may now be coming to an end .
<en> Sri Lanka deserves to live in peace , as we in Europe do .
<en> Like other colleagues in this House , I support a unitary state for Sri Lanka .
<en> I think it is also appropriate to place on record that I also think it is probably a good idea , within that unitary state , to grant the Tamils a degree of autonomy .
<en> I do not support the Tigers ' campaign of violence , and I consider it actually essential that the Sri Lankan army be permitted to continue their military campaign against the Tamil Tigers .
<en> However , it is also appropriate to recognise that there is a humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka at the moment , and the aid agencies should be allowed access .
<en> So perhaps it is appropriate to ask for a cessation of the fighting , whilst aid agencies can get access and whilst civilians are allowed to leave the disputed areas .
<en> But after that we have to allow the army to continue their campaign .

<2en> I think that the EU institutions must continue to support the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
<2en> This court has tried many war criminals but , at the same time , we must also bear in mind the broader significance of its decisions , such as its contribution to the process of reconciliation between the peoples of the Western Balkans .
<2en> I want to draw your attention to the fact that some of the indictments or verdicts issued by the ICC in The Hague have been regarded as controversial in different regions of the Western Balkans .
<2en> Lessons can be drawn from these reactions , which form part of the ICC 's legacy .
<2en> These reactions highlight at the same time the need for an Appeals Chamber as well as an outreach programme .
<2en> Let us not forget , however , that many other war criminals have not yet been tried .
<2en> The EU institutions must support the investigations conducted at national level in the Western Balkan states .
<2en> The EU Council must set out clear norms for evaluating the performance of the judiciary in the countries in the region after the International Court 's term comes to an end .
<2en> Those responsible must be duly tried and punished , individually , based on their actions .
<2en> Justice must be applied in the same way for everyone .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this report which will ensure that all those who committed War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia will not escape justice .
<en> I support this report because it will extend the temporary ICTY which prosecutes those who committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia by two years , ensuring enough time for the completion of ongoing trials .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on water in the light of the Fifth World Water Forum as I believe that we urgently need to devise global policies on water supply and management in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) .
<2en> These provide for the halving by 2015 of the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water .
<2en> However , the global financial crisis means that the Member States need to step up their support for the least developed countries , through public development aid and cooperation in adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change .
<sp>
<2en> Not even water can escape the privatising and liberalising zeal of the majority of the European Parliament .
<2en> The resolution is right when it says , albeit in the conditional , that ' water is a shared resource of mankind and that access to water should constitute a fundamental and universal right ' and that ' water is assumed as a public good and should be under public control ' .
<2en> However , what follows is serious and unacceptable .
<2en> It declares that , while water may be under public control , its management can be handed over ' partly or totally ' to the private sector .
<2en> This means keeping under public control the role of investment in collection and supply infrastructures , while giving the private sector the profitable role , namely the charging of consumers .
<2en> These experiments have already been conducted in several countries , particularly in Latin America , where prices have grown exponentially and quality has deteriorated .
<2en> We also do not agree with agriculture being held responsible , with agro-industry and small farmers being treated equally so that the latter suffer from high water prices .
<2en> As the capitalist crisis grows , water seems to be a tempting asset which can generate the profit that capital so greatly needs .
<2en> We continue to believe that water must be kept exclusively as a public good , in terms of both collection and supply .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , I voted in favour of Mr Berman 's resolution for the Fifth World Water Forum .
<en> The World Water Forum meets every three years and takes place next week in Istanbul .
<en> It is an opportunity to discuss global policy solutions for managing water and water resources and preparing the groundwork for them .
<en> Two years ago , I myself drafted a report on water management in the developing countries for the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
<en> As is evident from Mr Berman 's resolution too , poor management is largely the reason why the world 's water situation is bad .
<en> Support is needed , mainly to increase regional decision making and cooperation .
<en> It is also obvious that the public sector cannot alone come up with the World Bank 's estimated USD 49 billion a year ( up until 2015 ) to develop water infrastructures .
<en> To address the problems of water supply , a solution could be found to establish the funds needed by means of a partnership agreement between the public and private sectors , especially as state-owned companies are suffering from a dearth of funds and there is no chance of privatisation .
<en> Nor should the importance of research be underestimated in finding a solution to water problems .
<en> Adequate monitoring of , and investment in , subterranean water resources are also vital .
<en> Like energy , water is becoming more and more a political issue , and there is going to be a massive struggle to ensure access to it .
<en> There is an obvious need to make it a political priority before it is too late .

<en> ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have a question for you concerning the European Council .
<en> We have heard that at the meeting of the European Council you said that Parliament agrees that the vote on the President of the Commission should take place on 15 July and the vote on the remainder of the Commission should be held once the Treaty of Lisbon has been adopted .
<en> I would like to know whether or not this is true and , if it is true , on what authority you made these statements .
<sp>
<en> Mrs Frassoni , as you yourself were present , I am sure you will recall that we discussed this matter at the Conference of Presidents .
<en> There was only one objection with respect to 15 July , which came from you .
<en> All the other group chairmen shared the view expressed in my statement before the Council .
<en> In any case , you may read the exact wording I used in my speech .
<en> The speech is available to all MEPs and to the public .

<sp>
<en> President of the Commission . - Mr President , let me once again underline the excellent cooperation that we have had with the Czech Presidency .
<en> The Czech Presidency is making a great effort for Europe in a very difficult situation and I think they deserve our full support .
<en> Let me conclude .
<en> Whenever I conclude , I see crowds coming in to listen !
<en> ( Laughter )
<en> Let me conclude by welcoming the broad support for the results of the European Council .
<en> There is not unanimity , but I think it is a fair assessment to say that by and large there was a recognition that it was an important set of conclusions , and I am encouraged by what I see as a shared sense of commitment by all three institutions - Parliament , the Council and the Commission - to join forces in order to pull Europe through the crisis .
<en> We can be proud of what we have decided , but there should be no room for complacency .
<en> More has to be done , and we should keep our focus , but we will gain , we will succeed in these efforts if we show our confidence .
<en> Confidence has to be the key word : confidence in our capacity to deliver what we have promised ; confidence in action and implementation , and , as I said earlier , implementation , not gesticulation .
<en> Frankly , I do not believe that confidence will improve by announcing a new plan every month or every week .
<en> Confidence is improved if we concentrate on the implementation of what was collectively agreed and also on the effective coordination of these efforts .
<en> Confidence is needed in our ability to push our regulatory agenda : without regulatory form we will not create the confidence that change will have a lasting effect .
<en> Confidence is needed in the validity and the solidity of the euro area and our ability to mobilise the necessary support for every Member State in the euro area or outside the euro area which needs it .
<en> There is also a need for confidence in our shared commitment to preserve our particular brand of social market economy , and in our long-term agenda for a low-carbon economy .
<en> I really believe that it is not with self-defeating speeches and some kind of inferiority complex regarding the United States of America that we will succeed .
<en> In fact , what I see today is that the Americans are coming closer to what have been traditionally European positions .
<en> Americans are coming closer to our position regarding the fight against climate change , and we welcome that .
<en> Americans are coming closer to the need to reinforce the welfare system .
<en> Therefore , I really do not believe that the debate I sometimes hear - suggesting that Americans and Europeans are coming with very different approaches to the crisis - is a helpful debate .
<en> On the contrary , what we are seeing is increased convergence between Europe and the United States and hopefully others - because it is not just for us and the Americans - and that is why I am confident about a positive result of the G20 Summit .
<en> I think it is important to believe that it is with ourselves and not with others that we will solve the situation .
<en> It is important to have confidence in what are the European instruments , and this enlarged Europe , with our coordinated action in fighting this recession , will be in a position to respond to the most important concerns of our citizens , including , of course , the one that is my first concern , i.e. rising unemployment .
<en> To conclude , that is why I think we should build on what was already agreed and focus now on implementation , with strong coordination and a strong commitment to concrete results .
<en> ( Applause )

<en> - The debate is closed .
<en> Written statements ( Rule 142 )

<2en> I wish to express my support for the decisions adopted at the recent European Union summit held in Brussels .
<2en> What is particularly welcome is the necessary decision to increase the emergency fund from EUR 25 billion to EUR 50 billion .
<2en> This is a fund created specially for Member States in Central Europe which are faced with a balance of payments crisis .
<2en> Based on the measures adopted to protect states in the euro area against the global crisis , this decision provides concrete proof of the EU 's solidarity and its ability to help states outside the euro area to overcome the economic crisis .
<2en> After Hungary and Latvia , Romania has become the third EU Member State to resort to the emergency fund as it was affected by a significant current account imbalance and an inability to obtain new loans from foreign creditors .
<2en> EU institutions have a duty to meet the expectations of European citizens who are deeply affected by the crisis .
<2en> Only European solidarity , transatlantic cooperation and effective measures can help overcome the global crisis .
<sp>
<2en> My country , Poland , is especially interested in good management of the new EU Eastern Partnership programme .
<2en> It concerns our neighbours , and includes our closest neighbours , like Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova , as well as more distant ones like Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia .
<2en> I think that the programme will strengthen the external policy of the EU , bring about true economic integration between the EU and its Eastern partners and ensure cooperation based not only on the principles of a market economy , but also based on respect for shared values , such as democracy , law and order , and respect for human rights .
<2en> After all , we have specific , joint objectives : to create free-trade areas , promote the mobility of citizens of partner countries , improve administrative abilities , and cooperate on energy security and especially on the long term supply and transit of energy .
<2en> We have , therefore , a clear vision of partnership on the part of the EU .
<2en> Now we are waiting for a response from the six countries which have a direct interest in the programme .
<2en> I would like to express the hope that on 7 May this year the Council will officially initiate this undertaking , which is as important for the EU as it is for the citizens of all the participating countries .
<sp>
<en> , in writing . - ( HU ) The fact that the European Union has set aside EUR 3.5 billion of its economic stimulus package for key energy investments is a welcome development .
<en> I consider this an important step towards a common energy policy .
<en> The final list of the funded projects clearly indicates that the European Commission and the Member States have , after the gas crisis in January , understood at last the advantages of joining up the networks .
<en> Strengthening the connections is important first of all because it allows Member States to assist one another rapidly in the event of disruptions to supply .
<en> I would at the same time like to draw attention to the fact that there are contradictions surrounding the final list of the investments receiving financing .
<en> First and foremost , a crack has appeared in the principle of regional balance .
<en> For it is precisely the Member States that were most affected by the gas crisis in January that will receive less funding .
<en> Secondly , in proportion to the entire economic stimulus package , relatively little funding will be devoted to strengthening alternative supply routes .
<en> I believe that the debates around the Nabucco issue were unseemly .
<en> The gas pipeline in question would strengthen the energy security of the entire European Union , and thus its construction is a common interest .
<en> Last but not least , investments relating to energy efficiency do not figure on the list of the investments receiving financing .
<en> The EU is thus skirting the original aim of the package itself , namely job creation .
<en> For the above reasons , the position of the European Parliament must give a greater role to the principle of regional balance , as well as to alternative supply routes and energy efficient investments .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> - ( FR ) Mr President , the Presidency conclusions from the last Council make for amusing reading .
<en> They resemble a victory statement of routed armies everywhere .
<en> They have the pathetic quality of such statements , up to and including where they repeatedly affirm that , with the crisis coming to an end , the EU will build a stronger economy for the future , and where they reaffirm the Lisbon Strategy , while in fact it is going completely off the rails .
<en> It follows that , as they shut themselves away in their glass towers , Eurocrats , Europhiles and ultra-Europeans of all kinds end up no longer having a grip on matters .
<en> Everyone is well aware that the euro zone was the first to enter into recession because it had the lowest growth rate in the world for eight years .
<en> However , it was also the one that had the greatest difficulties in terms of its competitiveness and employment situation .
<en> Above all , it is the euro zone that , due to the general trend of stripping nations of their natural defences , is the worst equipped to react .
<en> In reality , the only virtue of the crisis is that it will wake up populations lulled by financial expectation facilities and anti-national propaganda .
<en> Only the Member States will have the legitimate instruments needed for any far-reaching action , and they will have to remove the shackles of the EU and the euro if such action is to be achieved .
<en> For the people of France , at least , it is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no safety without France , no France without French policy , and no French policy without national and popular sovereignty .
<sp>
<en> - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it seems to me that at the centre of this debate there remains the dogma that the banks should be central to the economy and that the process of globalisation should also be a fundamental part of our economic future .
<en> That dogma is completely wrong .
<en> We should return to our society 's traditional economic vision of social justice and genuine production .
<en> Since we all eat , go to sleep at night and dress ourselves , we should concentrate our activities and our efforts on enhancing agriculture , on building houses and on the manufacturing and craft industries .
<en> Without this new vision we will fall into perpetual crises where usury by the banks will continue to control people and injustice will be central to our lives .
<sp>
<en> - ( CS ) Mr President , I do not even know to whom I am talking , since the Czech Presidency is not even trying to attend .
<en> My congratulations on the results of the summit .
<en> The increase in IMF resources , the doubling of the crisis fund , the Eastern Partnership , the support for strategic infrastructure and the support for Nabucco all amount to a fulfilment of the ' Three Es ' of the Czech Presidency .
<en> It is a pity that preparations for Copenhagen are lagging behind and the Czech Presidency has not made use of our work on the energy-climate package .
<en> However , we are not dealing with any of that today .
<en> Your Presidency , just like your government , represents the politics of double standards .
<en> When in Europe you pose as sympathetic Europeans and great integrators but at home you talk about how you are going to walk all over them and you talk about the Lisbon Treaty as if it were no more than a scrap of paper .
<en> You have failed to integrate your own government .
<en> The election of Václav Klaus as President also belongs to the politics of double standards .
<en> It is the aim of millions of Czechs and Moravians to cement our ties to Western Europe , which will help us to overcome the worst crises .
<en> This aim cannot be achieved without ratifying the Lisbon Treaty .
<en> The Treaty is now under serious threat and this is partly also your responsibility .
<en> If you continue to govern in any form , you should make a clear stand for ratification .
<en> There are social and political elites in the Czech Republic who want ratification and who are ready to support whomever will follow it through .
<en> My own party , the European Democratic Party , will do all it can for ratification .
<en> The second serious omission is the euro .
<en> You can participate in the G20 summit and represent Europe at the summit .
<en> It is important for Europe to defend its regulatory measures against the US and not just to submit to a policy of excessive stimulation packages which can lead to hyperinflation .
<en> It is important to have a European Securities Commission and to maintain the stability pact .
<en> However , this also applies to us back home and it is your party that has kept us out of the euro zone for many years .
<en> Mr Topolánek , the proposed measures are excellent .
<en> At present they are only proposals .
<en> As Mrs Merkel has said , what matters is implementation .
<en> What is needed is the political will and unity which will make it possible to translate this into reality .
<en> You were talking about a crisis of confidence .
<en> That is what we have here .
<en> Get the Lisbon Treaty completed , change your position on the euro and facilitate the rapid drawdown of structural resources .
<en> Otherwise you will find it difficult to represent the 60 to 70 % of Czechs and Moravians who do not want to deal on unequal terms with Europe , but who do want to live in Europe in a normal way .
<sp>
<en> - ( SV ) Mr President , there is an issue that concerns a large number of European citizens today .
<en> It is increased unemployment and the wider gaps that it entails .
<en> They must have been extremely disappointed with the results of the most recent summit .
<en> Absolutely no strategy for dealing with rising unemployment was established at that summit .
<en> They say that they have already done what needs to be done .
<en> They also say that the summit that should have taken place at the beginning of May will no longer be a summit .
<en> It will now be a troika meeting .
<en> This is a clear signal to citizens that the EU 's leaders do not see employment and combating unemployment as a priority .
<en> The European Parliament is not involved at all - one month before the European Parliament elections .
<en> Mr Barroso has called for discussions today , but the Council 's conclusions do not even mention the European Parliament .
<en> I would like to say something briefly about automatic stabilisers .
<en> GM , the United States and Sweden have been mentioned in the debate today .
<en> It is true that we , in Sweden , have better social insurance systems , but the reimbursement rates have fallen from 80 % .
<en> Car workers who become unemployed will currently receive a pay-out of something in the region of between 50 % and 60 % of their pay .
<en> Thus , it is not quite so wonderful any more .
<en> Finally , I would like to say a few words about mobility .
<en> Mobility is important within the EU and so is the fight against protectionism .
<en> However , the Commission and the Council need to take responsibility and ensure that equal pay for equal work applies throughout the EU .
<en> Then we can also work to promote increased mobility and to combat protectionism .
<sp>
<en> - ( NL ) Mr President , a lot has been said about how much money we actually need to set aside in order to combat this economic crisis .
<en> We could discuss that for many hours .
<en> I believe that it is also necessary to take account of future generations and not to leave all the problems to them to sort out .
<en> Alongside that though , the issue of what we spend that money on is perhaps even more important .
<en> It does worry me when I see the reflex reaction of throwing money at the old industries and old technologies yet again , in an attempt to prop up ailing industries .
<en> It is also striking that , in the Council 's conclusions , the sections on the economic crisis and on energy and sustainability are just treated as two separate issues , when the time is actually ripe for these two issues to be tethered together .
<en> I would not want to be as pessimistic as Mr Turmes was earlier on , but now really is the time to invest in new technologies and in knowledge .
<en> It is intolerable that billions are being poured into the car industry while savings will have to be found when it comes to education .
<en> We have definitely got things the wrong way round there .
<en> Another point is the solutions for Eastern European countries and countries that are not in the single currency .
<en> These countries are being let down somewhat , with a sum of EUR 50 billion being mentioned .
<en> I wonder whether the Council and the Commission are also considering the option of accelerated accession to the eurozone for those countries that are not yet members , given that the stability and the strength of those countries are in the interests of Europe as a whole .
<en> Finally , I am very concerned by the use of nationalistic language and the tendency of all the national leaders to lean towards ' our country first ' solutions .
<en> We all need to take the rise of the far right seriously and we all need to ensure that we tackle it before the elections .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in order to ensure genuine access to justice for victims of breaches of competition rules , joint efforts must be made by the EU and the Member States .
<2en> The White Paper presents a series of recommendations aimed at ensuring that those affected by this type of infringement have access to really effective mechanisms to seek full compensation for the damage suffered .
<2en> At present in the majority of Member States there are serious barriers that discourage consumers and businesses from going to court to claim compensation on a private basis for damages suffered as a result of a breach of antitrust rules .
<2en> While there have been signs of improvement recently in some Member States , very few claims have been made over the last few decades .
<2en> The traditional laws and procedures on civil liability in force in the majority of Member States appear to be inadequate .
<2en> I welcome the drafting of a White Paper proposing a Community-level solution to the problem of ensuring access to justice for claimants , thus pursuing general policy objectives ( specifically , ensuring broader access to justice by enforcing competition policy and discouraging unlawful practices on the part of undertakings ) while at the same time preventing unmeritorious and opportunistic litigation .
<sp>
<2en> Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I intend to abstain from the vote on Mr Lehne 's report on the White Paper on damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules .
<2en> I agree with some , but not all , of the points highlighted in the report and for this reason I have decided not to vote for the report as it stands .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the report compiled by Czesław Adam Siekierski ( PPE-DE , Poland ) as it proposes the extension of the European food aid programme for the most deprived .
<2en> As a former mayor of Bucharest 's 5th district , I was always concerned about providing help to the poor , especially those of Roma ethnic origin .
<2en> Throughout the whole of the European Union 80 million people ( 16 % of the population ) are living below the poverty line , and their number is going to increase due to the economic crisis .
<2en> In some of the states which have recently joined the EU poverty affects roughly 20 % of the population .
<2en> Full funding is required from the EU budget for food aid programmes as some Member States will be unable to participate in the scheme when cofinancing rates apply .
<2en> We must reduce the load being shouldered by Member States with low per capita incomes or whose budgets are facing financial difficulties , which also includes Romania .
<2en> Products from intervention stocks or purchased on the market must be of Community origin , with preference given to locally-produced fresh food products , i.e. Romanian products to be purchased with European money for distribution to the poor in Romania .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) I voted in favour of the report on the amendment of a regulation on the financing of the common agricultural policy and the common organisation of agricultural markets as regards food distribution to the most deprived persons .
<en> According to the data , in 2006 approximately 13 million people from the Member States benefited from this programme .
<en> That is a good thing , but the assistance to the poorest in the EU should be greatly intensified .
<en> To begin with , let us cut European Commissioners ' pay in half or divide it by three .
<en> The European think-tank Open Europe has estimated that , pension schemes included , Commissioners earn on average EUR 2.5 million over five years , which is downright scandalous .
<en> The other half of that money would be better spent on poverty reduction .
<en> Perhaps that is a way of reconciling the European public with ' Europe ' .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons .
<2en> Poverty is one of the most serious problems currently facing the European Union .
<2en> In 2006 nearly 79 million people were threatened with poverty , which clearly shows the need for food aid programmes .
<2en> As the Commission proposal aims to distribute food to the most deprived persons and improve planning so that funds can be used more efficiently , and also bearing in mind that , since it began in 1987 , the food distribution programme has already benefited over 13 million people , I believe that the continuation of this programme is necessary and positive .

<en> ( RO ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , at the end of last week several hundred Romanian citizens were prevented from entering the territory of the Republic of Moldova .
<en> In most cases , no explanation was given ; otherwise , the strangest excuses were used , such as they did not have documents to show that they were not infected by the HIV virus .
<en> This is an unprecedented abuse .
<en> No other European citizens have ever had their right of free movement so grossly violated .
<en> I strongly support the European journey being made by the Republic of Moldova and its citizens , but I protest against this gross abuse and ask the European Commission and Council to request explanations from the authorities in Chişinău , just as Romania has already requested through the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) In my speech I would like to applaud the Commission 's initiative relating to the European Citizens Consultation 2009 project .
<en> This project brings together citizens from the 27 EU Member States ahead of the European Parliament elections in order to discuss responses to the question , ' what can the European Union do to influence our economic and social future in a globalised world ? '
<en> National consultations with Slovak citizens took place on 28-29 March .
<en> The European Citizens ' Summit will take place on 10-11 May 2009 in Brussels , where 150 participants from the 27 national consultations will draft a final version of the European recommendations which MEPs will be able to use in the coming election period as a basis for creating European legislation .
<en> I firmly believe that only through discussions with citizens will we renew their faith in the uniqueness of the European project .
<en> At the same time I call on the media to be more objective and more active in presenting information on the European Parliament as this will be important in influencing voter turnout .
<sp>
<en> ( HU ) A conference with a strange title was held at the European Parliament today on the defeat of the so-called Hungarian Soviet Republic .
<en> No such country name or event ever existed .
<en> I reject any political attitude that subordinates , for nationalist motives , to the nation state 's interests the historical questions that are connected to the retrospective justification of a state 's ambitions to gain territory .
<en> It is unacceptable for the invasion of Hungary , the Romanian military occupation and the plundering of the country from November 1918 to be interpreted as a factor in regional stabilisation at an event organised here in Brussels , at the heart of Europe , under the aegis of Members of European Parliament .
<en> On behalf of the Hungarian community in Romania as well , I firmly protest against the cynical behaviour of our Romanian socialist colleagues and against their misleading public relations manoeuvre and attempt to shape opinion guided by nationalist motives .
<sp>
<en> ( SK ) On 18 and 19 March 2009 the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Louis Michel visited Cuba .
<en> This was during the sixth anniversary of the imprisonment of 75 opposition representatives .
<en> During this visit Commissioner Michel did not meet with the Damas de Blanco or any other opposition representatives .
<en> According to information from European diplomats , Commission Michel did not take the opportunity to mention human rights or the anniversary .
<en> On Cuban opposition radio Mr Michel said that the date was an official error and that he did not know that the Damas de Blanco wanted to meet him .
<en> I have to say that Deputy President Martinez of the European Parliament , who was an official member of the delegation representing the European Parliament , also failed to meet with the opposition , although he did meet with the families of Cuban spies arrested in the US .
<en> Martinez thus allowed the Castro regime to exploit his visit and the meeting he attended in order to distract media attention away from the activities of Damas de Blanco relating to the anniversary , as media coverage concentrated on the visit of the Commissioner and this meeting .

<en> rapporteur . - Mr President , in order to remove any misunderstanding and to comply with the requests made by Italian colleagues from the new Partito della Libertà belonging to the PPE-DE and UEN Groups , I propose an oral amendment to footnote 1 to recital S , first indent , to delete the last two sentences and insert ' IT ' ( Italy ) in the sequence at the beginning of the paragraph .
<en> You have this in your voting list .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , I appreciate the rapporteur 's suggestion , but this resolution contains too many references - not only in this point and in this footnote of the proposed oral amendment , but in many other parts of the resolution .
<en> For various reasons it refers to all the Member States and also to the very subject that you have asked to be deleted from the footnote , relating to the very subjects that appear in other parts of the resolution .
<en> I therefore believe , Mr President , and this is my proposal , that my fellow Member should ask for the resolution to be further amended and then referred back to committee for re-examination .
<sp>
<en> ( IT ) Mr President , on the admissibility of Mrs Vălean 's amendment : Mrs Vălean was quite right to go back and correct the text , removing the vague and misleading reference to third and fourth wives , which led to doubts over the legitimacy of polygamy .
<en> We should nevertheless clarify that , unfortunately , the questionnaire sent to the Member States contained this incorrect terminology .
<en> In other words , Member States were asked for their opinion on the right to free movement of second , third and fourth wives .

<sp>

<2en> I voted in favour of the report on Community statistics on the information society as information and communication technologies make an important contribution to productivity in the European Union and to the growth of GDP .
<2en> The purpose of this regulation is to guarantee the continuation of the existing common framework in order to produce systematically Community statistics on the information society which are reliable , harmonised , supplied on time and of high quality , as well as to supply annual statistics on the use of ITC in companies and households .
<2en> I support those provisions aimed at simplifying the administrative procedures incumbent upon the public authorities ( Community or national ) as well as on private individuals .
<2en> I believe that there is a permanent need at European level to supply consistent statistics on the information society every year .
<2en> I support the implementation of the i2010 strategy .
<2en> This promotes an open , competitive digital economy and underlines the key role played by ICT in terms of inclusion and quality of life .
<2en> This strategy is regarded as a fundamental element in the revitalised Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs .
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of Mrs Niebler 's report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 808 / 2004 concerning Community statistics on the information society .
<2en> I believe that the amendments tabled are essential because they are useful for compiling harmonised , reliable , timely and high-quality Community statistics on the information society .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for adoption of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending Annex 11 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products .
<2en> I agree with the remarks of the rapporteur concerning further integration of both markets .
<2en> The Agreement would contribute to an improvement in productivity of both partners ' agricultural sectors and help to bring food prices to a fair and relatively stable level for citizens .
<2en> Nonetheless , I agree with the view that both parties should negotiate with caution towards full liberalisation of trade exchange .
<2en> The volume of bilateral trade is significant and removal of the trade barrier would have a strong impact , especially on the agricultural economy of EU countries neighbouring Switzerland and on Swiss farmers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Glattfelder , on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending Annex 11 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products ;
<sp>
<2en> I have voted in favour of Mr Varvitsiotis 's report on the mutual recognition to decisions on supervision measures .
<2en> I believe , in fact , that supervision measures should be considered an exceptional measure that should be weighed carefully with regard to the right to freedom and to the presumption of innocence .
<2en> Sadly , I have to agree with the rapporteur when he states that so far it has not been possible to recognise measures other than supervision measures across borders , because no specific instrument of mutual recognition exists .
<2en> This is an obstacle to the legal protection of individual rights , and an aspect that we must discuss again .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my sincere thanks go to Mr Schnellhardt for his excellent work and cooperation .
<en> It is good that we have had a first-rate expert in the field as our rapporteur on this issue .
<en> The main objective of the regulation before us is the guarantee of hygiene and human health and safety .
<en> I would now , however , like to mention another detail , which is important for protecting biodiversity and small-scale entrepreneurship in nature tourism in my country .
<en> I am pleased that political consensus was found within Parliament and also with the Council of Ministers to resolve this issue .
<en> This is about small-scale operations which take the carcasses of dead animals on farms with livestock , in pigsties for example , directly to feeding sites in the country for wild animals to feed on .
<en> This is important , for example , in Spain , to maintain the wild bird of prey population .
<en> In Finland such practices saved the white-tailed eagle from extinction back in the times when its natural food supply was too contaminated owing to chemical toxins , and when white-tailed eagles would not have been able to breed just by surviving on natural food sources .
<en> In the northern , very sparsely populated parts of Finland , nature photographers use this method to attract wild animals to places where they can be photographed , and small travel companies also organise bear watching safaris , for example .
<en> I am very glad that this legislation would provide a solution which would safeguard human health and safety but also preserve small-scale tourism entrepreneurship and the use of the method to protect biodiversity .
<sp>
<en> Madam President , I agree with all contributors that public health , food safety and hygiene have to be at the top of all our agendas .
<en> I would put very high on my agenda , too , making maximum use of all natural resources , including animal by-products .
<en> I should like to thank our rapporteur , Horst Schnellhardt , for his excellent work in accommodating all our concerns and also for the excellent outcome of his discussions with the European Council .
<en> Personally , I regret the removal of the reference to the Waste Incineration Directive , but I do not have time to expand on that here .
<en> I had one amendment tabled asking for assurances that there should be a clear distinction made between animal by-products moved in large volumes between Member States and at risk of entering the food or feed chain and specialist animal by-products for pharmaceutical and other diagnostic and research use ; the latter are safe-sourced high-value products which are transported between Member States in very small volumes to and from registered suppliers , processers and users .
<en> I should like confirmation , both from the Commissioner and Horst Schnellhardt again in his winding-up words , that my concerns in this area are taken care of and that this particular use of animal by-products will continue without any disruption .
<sp>
<en> Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today 's debate has shown broad support for the common position on animal by-products , and this enables the Commission to proceed with the next stage .
<en> The Commission will prepare the implementing provisions for the new regulation in the light of your comments today , we will listen attentively to the experiences of operators , we will talk with our partners at international level and we will be fully transparent with Parliament during the whole of the process .
<en> I can thus confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission in relation to comitology and the optional provisions .
<en> Regarding the question raised by Mrs Doyle , I wanted to say that the current regulation already recognises the particular food needs of certain wild species and allows the Member States to use by-products for feeding wild animals , provided that the health risks are appropriately controlled .
<en> However , recently it has been stressed that the Commission should step up efforts to preserve biodiversity .
<en> For this reason , the Commission agrees with the decision by the legislator to extend the terms on the feeding of animal species protected in their natural habitats with by-products of animal origin ; whereas the current rules refer to vultures and eagles , the new regulation will also make it possible to find appropriate solutions for wolves and bears .
<en> On the basis of recent experience , we are also considering the advisability of laying down arrangements which would go beyond the current system of fixed points for the feeding of protected species with animal carcasses , particularly for extensive breeding systems , provided that specific health standards are abided by .
<en> On this point , the Commission is ready to enter into dialogue with all the parties involved .
<sp>
<en> rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Ulmer , I have of course taken note of the concern you expressed about the possible mixing of Category 1 and 2 materials and we also consulted the industry regarding this problem at the end of the negotiations .
<en> I think that one would already need to act extremely illegally in order to be able to mix in this material .
<en> We will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here .
<en> What we wanted to achieve with this new regulation was to enable the by-products of slaughter to be used in many ways and in that regard I can also say to Mrs Doyle that your concern is unfounded .
<en> Everything is the same as before .
<en> By establishing the end point for slaughter by-products , we have also very clearly stipulated that they will then become subject to totally different provisions , in other words we have clearly indicated the transfer to the Waste Framework Directive .
<en> I believe that we are on the right path here .
<en> I would also like to mention that we naturally also want to address the issue of the rotten meat scandals with this new regulation .
<en> We are not completely on the right path yet in this regard , but with the labelling and the guaranteed traceability , I believe that we are heading in the right direction .
<en> Of course , we now need to see what sort of labelling the Commission will propose .
<en> This will not be particularly easy , as we all know the problem of the blue Chappi dog food - no one wants that .
<en> In this respect , we definitely need our researchers to choose an approach .
<en> As regards the issue of organic fertilisers , which was also up for debate and has not yet been properly discussed , the Commission actually intended to provide for more thorough mixing-in of the material so that the animals did not even notice it .
<en> However , that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for .
<en> By and large , then , this is a good regulation .
<en> I am very happy with it and with the cooperation , and I hope that we will not have to amend it again too soon .
<en> The cooperation with the Commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful .
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , with regard to the planning of the sitting , I would like to mention that we had a very long voting session yesterday and that led to a lot of problems with subsequent appointments .
<en> We will be adjourning very shortly today and we will not start the voting until 12 noon .
<en> Perhaps it would be possible to plan the sitting so as to divide the time up more efficiently .
<en> That would help the Members and , in particular , the visitors , who yesterday had to wait for us for a considerable length of time .
<en> These are , of course , citizens , who also have a right to talk to their Members , and in this regard I would be very pleased if , in future , in the planning of the sitting we could schedule such procedures to everyone 's satisfaction .
<sp>
<en> Thank you , Mr Rübig .
<en> We shall note and pass on your comments .
<en> It is a very difficult time as we approach the end of the mandate .
<en> The debate is closed .
<en> The vote will take place today at 12.00 .
<en> ( The sitting was suspended at 10.15 and resumed at 10.50 . )
<chp>
<sp>
<en> Madam President , it would appear that there has been some error in the text published on the internet by Parliament 's services .
<en> It is incorrectly worded and inconsistent with the text which was actually tabled in the joint resolution by my group and others .
<en> I do not know whether you have been informed of this and whether you can take it into account , but the text in paragraph 2 should read ' Respecting the individual wishes of anyone living in Camp Ashraf as regards to their future ; ' .
<en> That is not what is actually published and that is what should be in the text .
<sp>
<en> Mr Tannock , I have been informed and all of the linguistic corrections will be made .
<en> After the vote
<sp>
<en> ( DE ) Madam President , I would like to draw your attention to the fact that behind me , among the far-right radicals , there are people who are not Members , and as far as I can see , they are also using the voting cards .
<en> ( Uproar )
<sp>
<en> Mr Martin , all of that will be verified .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) Although I voted against this resolution , I wanted to make clear that it certainly contains many positive elements , not least with regard to the reinforcement of Frontex and a better , complementary European internal security policy .
<en> The key problem for me , though , remains the fact that Parliament tenaciously clings to the Lisbon Treaty as if it were the great saviour .
<en> Naturally , we will not make any progress in this way .
<en> It remains a fight to the finish , and eventually , only democracy and the credibility of a democratic European project are set to suffer .
<en> Needless to say , I completely disagree with extending the application of the ' blue card ' system .
<en> This is something I feared from the beginning , and this fear has become reality .
<en> As ever , the typical European salami policy , whereby decisions are taken piecemeal and the effects of subsequent decisions are kept secret in the meantime , must be rammed down our throats .
<sp>
<2en> The G20 Summit and the awareness of the need for a coordinated and cooperative response to the current world economic situation are an expression of the positive side to globalisation .
<2en> No longer are there solitary powers , independent economies or dispensable globalised countries .
<2en> On the contrary , those countries experiencing much worse conditions than these ' victims ' of the crisis , but which have not been involved in globalisation , as is the case with most of the African countries , still have their problems and remain outside the solution .
<2en> That is the problem to which no solution is being given .
<2en> The other lesson of these times is that the only alternative to the market economy is a market economy that functions better .
<2en> That is the road to be taken .
<2en> Finally , I must underline that the capacity to respond to the crisis very much depends on whether or not there is the capacity to reform national economies and create conditions of flexibility .
<2en> At the same time as responding to the financial crisis , we need to respond to the paradigm shift in the world economy .
<2en> Otherwise , we will experience a deep but cyclical crisis , without solving the structural problems in our economies .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I agree with the recommendations emerging from this resolution , which comes at an urgent time to address the financial crisis .
<en> It must first be said that we are not through the crisis yet and that the authorities cannot relax in the thought that it will pass .
<en> Several key aspects are important to be acted on .
<en> First , dealing with ' systemic risks ' : the international institutions need to be strengthened to face future threats .
<en> Inside the EU a sole authority such as the ECB must be considered for reasons of coordinating strong actions when urgently required .
<en> Secondly , the revamping of existing legislation and introduction of new legislation which recognises the specific needs of sectors of the financial services industry , in particular Solvency II and CRD , are vital elements which contribute to the management of risk .
<en> Also , credit rating agencies are now going to be regulated .
<en> On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States , it is important to continue with sensible , balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism .
<en> We will face rising unemployment and falling demand .
<en> Social policies , too , have to reflect the concerns of European citizens and need to be of higher concern than seems apparent from the recommendations currently known .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) The Western Balkans region has for years been the scene of the most barbarous massacres in Europe .
<en> The prospect of membership of the EU represents , as things stand , the main guarantee of stability and reform .
<en> Some progress still needs to be made : we should remember that neighbourhood and cooperation policies underpin the region 's progress towards EU membership and that in the Western Balkans region certain bilateral issues between the various states , both Community and non-Community , are still to be resolved .
<en> The influence of the EU , however , and its ability to act as a mediator , supporting the reforms underway in the Balkans , will allow those states to fully meet the Copenhagen criteria and to join the EU as fully-fledged members .
<en> To support ever-increasing integration , chiefly between young people , it is our duty to back the increase in funding and the number of study grants available in the EU for students and researchers from the western Balkans within the framework of the Erasmus Mundus programme .
<en> This will not only represent another educational opportunity for many youngsters , but it will allow many young people to get to know personally other people of their own age within the EU , so that they feel themselves to be full citizens of Europe , each with his own identity , but united in diversity .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( NL ) All in all , this resolution has been drafted in balanced terms .
<en> Nevertheless , I voted against it because a ' yes ' vote would imply that I support the Lisbon Treaty and the accession of all the Western Balkans countries .
<en> Both my party and the absolute majority of Europeans are opposed to the Lisbon Treaty , should they be given the opportunity to vote , and to further accessions .
<en> This Parliament may ignore the wishes and lamentations of the European citizen , but I certainly do not .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> ( FR ) Mr President , pursuant to Article 1 of the code of honour of the European Parliament , on behalf of my group I should like to thank you for the sittings you have chaired .
<en> You were one of the best - thank you .
<en> ( Loud applause )
<sp>
<en> It is true that we are coming to the final vote - may I say a few personal words of thanks to you for your confidence and for the friendship you have shown me for so long .
<en> For the last time in this parliamentary term , and for the last time in my existence , I am therefore going to ask you to vote .
<en> We shall then go our separate ways .
<en> I am convinced that , our political differences and our paths aside , we shall all remain true to Europe 's ideals , but you should know that , from my perspective , to have had the good fortune to chair these debates , in this collegial atmosphere , for 10 years will forever remain a very great honour in my life .
<en> ( Loud applause )
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> EU support , particularly from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund , is fundamental in helping those who have lost their jobs due to the relocations that have occurred in a globalised market .
<2en> In recent years , especially as a result of the world economic crisis , Portugal has been feeling the effects of the problem of how to reabsorb and reintegrate the unemployed into the labour market .
<2en> Countless firms have relocated to take advantage of the lower labour costs found in China and India , for example , with dire consequences for the entire national economy .
<2en> The approval of EGF money to help these workers is vital not only for improving their personal and family situations , but also for the whole national economy , because the aim of these exceptional measures in the longer term is to help these workers to find and keep a new job .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour because I believe this support is important for Portuguese workers .
<2en> I feel , however , that Portugal 's application was not ambitious enough .
<2en> The Portuguese Government asked the EGF for EUR 833 for each worker made redundant in the textile sector , whereas Spain applied for EUR 3 006 per worker in the same sector .
<2en> I also find it somewhat surprising that , in the midst of an economic crisis with rising unemployment , in which the effects of globalisation can be felt , the EGF has received and accepted so few applications from the Member States .
<2en> In fact , the EGF has EUR 500 million available for all the Member States this year , and to date only about EUR 60 million has been utilised .
<sp>
<2en> We voted in favour of this report , since the European Parliament is giving the green light for Portugal to receive EUR 832 800 to help workers made redundant in the textile industry in Portugal 's Norte and Centro regions .
<2en> This is a tiny sum , however , and it is merely a palliative measure , given the severe unemployment experienced in Portugal today , particularly in those regions .
<2en> As we all know , Portugal applied to the European Commission for this money in January this year , and it relates to 1 588 redundancies reported between February and November 2008 in 49 textile companies in the northern and central regions of the country .
<2en> Approval has also been given , however , for EUR 3 306 750 to support 1 720 workers dismissed from 30 textile companies in Cataluña , Spain .
<2en> What was really needed , though , was a policy to support production , particularly in the textile sector , to prevent further company closures and further redundancies .
<sp>
<2en> While I agree with the basic principle , I believe that the seriousness of the crisis calls for provisions on an altogether different scale , not least to allow SMEs access to credit and to have credit that is conducive to employment , territorial development and the development of human capabilities .
<sp>
<2en> The motions submitted by Spain and Portugal to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) once again make clear the consequences of globalisation .
<2en> In the countries of south-east Asia and , in particular , in the special economic zones , where people are exploited and employed without minimum social standards , textiles are being produced at dumping prices and then sold on the European market .
<2en> European companies , which respect the social rights of employees that have been established and acquired over decades , are left at a disadvantage because of the higher costs that they incur as a result .
<2en> We must stop this development from going any further immediately .
<2en> A ban must be imposed as soon as possible on the import of products into the EU which are not produced under specific minimum social standards .
<2en> Until this has been achieved , we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the relevant countries .
<2en> Therefore , I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund .
<chp>
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Fine Gael members of the EPP Group voted in favour of Draft amending budget No 8 / 2009 .
<en> We note that this vote includes the creation of a budget item to provide supplementary funding to the High Flux Reactor ( HFR ) at Petten , Netherlands .
<en> Originally , the facility was set up to evaluate materials used in fusion and fission reactors .
<en> It has become an indispensable facility for the production of radioisotopes for the medical sectors , covering some 60 % of European demand .
<en> The report also provides support for , among other things , a strengthened budget to eradicate the bluetongue disease and assistance with European policing and anti-fraud .
<en> On balance , given the nature of the HFR and the mix of budget items covered , the Fine Gael delegation voted to support Draft amending budget No 8 / 2009 .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of the abovementioned report which includes an increase in loan commitments for programmes aiming at eradicating and tracking animal diseases as well as observing the physical well-being of animals which could present a threat to public health linked to external factors .
<en> At the same time , I would like to emphasise my disagreement with the other issues raised in the report , which should not have been included in this report :
<en> The creation of budget item 10 04 04 02 ( Operation of the high-flux reactor ( HFR ) ) ;
<en> The creation of budget item 18 05 02 03 ( European Police ) ;
<en> A reinforcement of the Community subsidy to EUROJUST ;
<en> Modifications to the establishment plan of OLAF , without additional financial provisions .
<sp>
<2en> The report on Draft amending budget No 8 / 2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009 includes some contradictory points .
<2en> It focuses on the increase in resources to eradicate bluetongue disease in sheep , the pursuit of a research programme on the use of a nuclear reactor installed in the Netherlands , the Europol and Eurojust programmes , and OLAF .
<2en> In voting against this draft report , I obviously did not wish to take a stand against provisions that are vitally important to sheep farmers .
<2en> I wished to take a stand against the ever-persistent use of nuclear power .
<2en> Above all , I wished to reaffirm my commitment to combating the construction of a fortress , security-driven and ineffective Europe to ensure the safety of our fellow citizens , via the Europol and Eurojust budgets .
<2en> There is a need to curb these policies which , in the name of the fight against insecurity and terrorism , are increasingly undermining the fundamental freedoms and rights of our fellow citizens , and to review and redefine the mandates of the various Community agencies and bodies involved in these policies .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> A political agreement in Copenhagen is crucial , but it needs to be global .
<2en> Putting European industry is a situation which is greatly disproportional to that of other developed economies would be a mistake for the economy and of little use in ecological terms .
<2en> European efforts should be directed towards seeking an agreement that places an obligation on all parties .
<2en> Europe must also find effective and reasonable solutions to the issue of funding .
<2en> This precludes the idea of a tax on international financial transactions ( Tobin tax ) to fund adaptation to climate change in developing countries .
<2en> That kind of support , necessary though it is , must not be given at the expense of the economy , trade and wealth creation .
<2en> The cost that such a tax would have for society in general ( increasing the tax burden , with consequences for all taxpayers and consumers ) and its impact on the financial market ( decreasing the necessary liquidity and flow of credit to businesses and households ) cannot be ignored .
<2en> In addition , the implementation of a global tax would lead to technical problems and complex administration .
<2en> In a crisis , the way out cannot involve yet more , new taxes which would be difficult to collect .
<2en> We need to forget this idea of a new tax .
<sp>
<2en> The EU should continue to lead by example in combating climate change .
<2en> It is worth noting that the EU has surpassed the goals drawn up in Kyoto .
<2en> I believe that the Copenhagen agreement to reduce global carbon emissions should be binding .
<2en> In view of this , I have presented an amendment to Parliament 's resolution on this matter , requesting an international set of sanctions to be set out in the final text .
<2en> I believe that the agreement must be global , ambitious and with a clear timeline .
<2en> If we are not ambitious , we will end up with a useless instrument that will be even less effective than the Kyoto Protocol , which already provides for international sanctions .
<2en> We hope that there will be effective regulation and that the agreement will include a review clause so that it can be easily updated .
<2en> We must also send a clear signal to emerging industries in Asia .
<2en> China and India cannot be exempted of all responsibility when they produce a large percentage of global emissions while our industries are going to great lengths to reduce their emissions .
<2en> The US has a great responsibility for ensuring the success of this summit .
<2en> I hope that the President of the United States , Barack Obama , will show that he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize , because combating climate change will contribute to peace and happiness for all nations !
<sp>
<2en> The climate is changing .
<2en> This has happened many times in the past .
<2en> There are over 6 billion of us , and what was once an extreme phenomenon and went unnoticed is , today , evident .
<2en> What is more - elaborately built infrastructures , of power generation and supply for example , often fail , and the effects of this include blackouts and breakdowns of IT networks .
<2en> There is also the problem of the desertification of vast areas of the Earth .
<2en> This is causing a humanitarian and economic catastrophe .
<2en> The first signs of this are the unrest in Somalia and predictions of future conflicts over water .
<2en> The wave of migration is growing .
<2en> Will these problems be resolved by restrictive limitations on CO2 emissions ?
<2en> No .
<2en> Firstly , no one has proved that it is CO2 emissions which are the cause of climate change .
<2en> Secondly , the effects of these limitations of CO2 emissions can be expected only at the end of the century .
<2en> Thirdly , restrictions in the area of CO2 emissions will only weaken humanity economically , and so will make the catastrophe worse .
<2en> As for emissions trading , it is an anti-social proposal , and its costs will be borne by ordinary people .
<2en> The profits , however , will be swept up by the financial world , including the world of speculation .
<2en> Therefore , for humanitarian and social reasons , the most important matter is not to combat the highly unlikely causes of climate change , but to combat the results of climate change .
<2en> It is not a matter of adapting to climate change , but of proactive action .
<2en> For example , in my country , security of water supply is already an important matter .
<sp>
<2en> Global warming currently poses two major problems to humankind : on the one hand , the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically and , on the other hand , the need to adapt to the effects of climate change .
<2en> Bearing in mind that we are dealing with a global phenomenon and that the EU is responsible for only 10 % of the emissions produced by greenhouse gases worldwide , it is important that we reach a mandatory , global legal agreement in Copenhagen in two weeks ' time .
<2en> I welcome President Obama 's attendance in Copenhagen with a mandate including clear targets for reducing emissions , which the US is going to commit to .
<2en> In order to adapt to the effects of climate change , we need a funding mechanism , providing exact figures for the sums which need to be invested in green technologies which create new jobs , something which is so necessary during this crisis period .
<sp>
<2en> The aim of the international climate change conference which begins in Copenhagen on 7 December is to establish a post-Kyoto agreement which will make the countries of the world reduce polluting emissions .
<2en> The EU has unilaterally committed to cut polluting emission levels by 20 % compared to 2005 levels , as well as to ensure that 20 % of the energy consumed comes from renewable sources .
<2en> However , these efforts must be coordinated with the efforts of all developed or developing countries .
<2en> Energy consumption and polluting emissions can be reduced quickly and cheaply by boosting energy efficiency on a global scale .
<2en> This is why the EU and Member States must increase energy efficiency , particularly in the buildings and transport sectors .
<2en> For the EU to be able to cut the polluting emissions produced by energy-intensive industries in line with the commitments made , the financial resources need to be provided for modernising European companies .
<2en> This is the only way we are going to maintain production and , by extension , jobs in the European Union .
<2en> During the EU 's budgetary review , we must ensure that sufficient financial resources are available for adopting measures to protect against climate change and adapt to its effects .
<2en> The development of an eco-efficient global economy will generate new investments , create new jobs and raise living standards .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of the European Parliament 's own-initiative report on evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan ( the Paulsen report ) , because I fully support the objective of strengthening animal welfare in the EU .
<2en> However , it is not clear in the report whether the EU is to establish maximum harmonisation in this area .
<2en> I would not under any circumstances be able to support a future proposal that prevented Member States from producing better mandatory standards for animal welfare than the standards that we are able to agree on at EU level .
<2en> On the contrary , I believe that it is vital for the continued pursuit of better animal welfare that it is possible for Member States to lead the way in this area .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( SV ) I voted in favour of Mrs Paulsen 's report on animal welfare legislation .
<en> However , I should like to point out that it is important for this legislation to represent minimum standards .
<en> The Member States and the regions must have the opportunity to implement more far-reaching animal welfare legislation .
<sp>
<2en> The report on which we voted today assesses , objectively and critically , the results of the Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010 and sets realistic and necessary targets for the growth - in the sense of progress - of food production and consumption in the European Union .
<2en> One point that I would highlight is the recognition that better quality products means increased costs for producers , especially primary producers , which does not normally mean increased commercial demand , since only a minority of consumers will choose more expensive products .
<2en> The report therefore emphasises the need to compensate these same producers for their efforts .
<2en> The intention to impose the regulations applicable to EU products on the products of third countries should also be noted , as it ensures fair and balanced competition in trade .
<2en> Finally , it seems important to me to make the argument for creating a European coordinating body and adopting general and common legislation , in order to harmonise best practices and establish supervision mechanisms .
<sp>
<2en> Whilst the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) supports animal welfare , this is a matter for the Member States and not for the EU .
<sp>
<2en> Today , we have adopted an important resolution which assesses the European Commission 's Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010 .
<2en> High standards of animal health are required not only by arguments of an ethical nature , but also by concern for the safety and quality of animal products , and this undoubtedly engenders a positive , reliable European agricultural brand .
<chp>

<2en> It is envisaged that every household within the EU should have a broadband Internet connection at a competitive price by 2013 .
<2en> In addition , the intention is for Europe to be the most mobile continent in the world in terms of Internet access by 2015 .
<2en> I support the measures to that effect and have therefore voted in favour of this report .
<sp>
<2en> The new Digital Agenda for Europe is an ambitious programme to disseminate new technologies and fast links in the Member States , which is why I voted for it .
<2en> However , apart from the pronouncements in principle which it makes , such as increasing mobile connection speeds and familiarising citizens with the new technologies , it would appear that some objectives will be extremely difficult to attain .
<2en> For example , it would appear that , although highly desirable , the objective requiring all schools in the European Union to have high-speed Internet by 2015 will be difficult to achieve for objective reasons ( for example in remote mountain and island countries , it is difficult to achieve high speeds immediately ) .
<2en> Consequently , the new Digital Agenda for Europe should be supported by a series of coordinated actions and initiatives , such as more generous EU funding to safeguard better access to the Internet , even for pupils at a geographical disadvantage .
<sp>
<2en> Europe continues to be a global leader in the field of advanced information and communication technologies ( ICT ) .
<2en> The World Wide Web , the GSM standard for mobile telephones , the MPEG standard for digital content and ADSL technology are European inventions .
<2en> Retaining this leadership and transforming it into a competitive advantage is a vital political objective .
<2en> Over the last four years , ICT policies have confirmed these technologies ' role as a driving force in the economic and social modernisation of Europe , and have strengthened Europe 's resilience in times of crisis .
<2en> All of the Union 's Member States have developed ICT policies and consider these technologies to be an essential contribution to domestic growth and employment in the context of the renewed Lisbon Strategy .
<2en> Despite this , in the first decade of the 21st century , the EU is lagging behind in terms of ICT research and innovation .
<2en> This is why the Union has launched ambitious research programmes intended to close the gap and to support far-sighted research and development activities .
<2en> I would therefore repeat , clearly , my full support for these actions , in the firm belief that Europe can once again become a leader and prime mover in this extremely important sector .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this Parliament own-initiative report given the importance of the Digital Agenda in strengthening European technological leadership .
<2en> Information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) are a key factor for growth at this time of economic recovery , but they are also essential to sustainable growth and the fight against social exclusion .
<2en> The report supports the main points identified by the Ministerial Declaration on the Digital Agenda approved at the Informal Meeting of Telecommunications Ministers in Granada on 18 and 19 April .
<2en> Parliament reiterates the need for the EU to have sound , swift and efficient infrastructures and encourages the adoption of measures that enable the achievement of full broadband coverage for all citizens .
<2en> All citizens need to partake in the digital revolution for it to become a success .
<2en> However , in order for this success to become a reality , aspects such as Internet security cannot be left to one side .
<2en> The adopted report , therefore , is not only committed to providing all citizens with computer skills , but at the same time highlights the need to reinforce Internet security and respect for citizens ' rights .
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> Divorce is always a difficult process .
<2en> However , when the two people involved come from different countries , the matter becomes even more complex .
<2en> It is important , on the one hand , that the national regulations are unaffected and , on the other , that we can achieve more clarity and legal certainty .
<2en> However , this proposal will not result in a sufficiently clear situation , which is why I have voted against the report .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I decided to vote in favour of this recommendation and fully support this historic occasion to activate - for the first time - the enhanced cooperation procedure .
<en> Whereas 140 000 divorces with an international element were pronounced in the Union in 2007 , European citizens are still confronted with legal problems when engaging in cross-border separation procedures .
<en> It is our task to remove these inextricable judicial impediments and simplify as much as possible these intrinsically painful episodes in people 's lives .
<en> Although my country , Lithuania , does not participate in this enhanced cooperation at the moment , I fully support this initiative since it represents a good example of how many EU citizens can profit in practical terms from being Union citizens .
<en> The European Union , its citizens and the internal market will directly benefit from this historic enhanced cooperation insomuch as it contributes to eliminating further discriminations and possible obstacles to the free movement of persons .
<en> It will increase the EU 's visibility and its legitimacy .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This was not at all a controversial report for our group , which is the reason why we supported it with no major debates .
<sp>
<2en> As Joseph Daul , President of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , stressed , Estonia 's adoption of the euro on 1 January 2011 is a double sign of confidence : Estonia 's confidence in the euro , a truly positive signal for the markets , but also the EU 's confidence in Estonia , which will become the first Baltic State to take that step .
<2en> This confidence is completely justified , as the Estonian Government debt ratio is the lowest in Europe .
<2en> I therefore voted firmly in favour of this report recommending Estonia 's entry into the euro area .
<sp>
<2en> I am pleased that , despite being in a difficult economic situation , Estonia , one of the Baltic States , has managed to join the euro area .
<2en> The Estonian example demonstrates that , thanks to balanced and focused policies , it is possible to achieve compliance with all the requirements for convergence .
<2en> The fact that countries still want to join the euro area during the crisis shows great confidence in this currency .
<2en> I am convinced that in Lithuania , too , political will and efforts to introduce the euro have not weakened .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> We are at the final stage in making the decisions which will enable the European External Action Service to be launched .
<2en> I support a compromise on the Staff Regulations and Financial Regulation which will allow the High Representative to have a service up and running this December .
<2en> However , this support does not equate to giving carte blanche .
<2en> The High Representative must meet her commitment , already reiterated on a number of occasions , to ensure that Member States such as Romania , currently under-represented in the Commission 's and Council 's foreign affairs structures that will be transferred to the EEAS , are fairly represented in the European External Action Service .
<2en> This is not a matter of exerting national control over the EEAS , but of an interest in having geographical balance included as a criterion for recruiting staff to the service .
<2en> This criterion and competence are not mutually exclusive .
<sp>
<2en> Mass protests and strikes in reaction to harsh austerity measures are currently crippling France .
<2en> If the excessive administration is also increased at the same time , as has happened in Greece , with the government expanding despite the need for rescue packages , then the people in Europe will quite rightly be annoyed .
<2en> The EU has hitherto always boasted that it has a lean administration - which , of course , is not true if we take into account the separate agencies .
<2en> Fifty directors-general with a princely EUR 17 000 per month for an initial 30 employees , 73 promotions to the position of director - we could easily get the impression that this is a self-service shop .
<2en> Of course , it is important for an EEAS employee to have the right qualifications .
<2en> In this regard , gender quotas , for example , do not serve any useful purpose .
<2en> However , as the saying goes , ' he who pays the piper calls the tune ' , so it makes sense not to offend the net contributors .
<2en> The refusal to increase the use of German as a working language in the EEAS has already created some diplomatic rifts .
<2en> It is not a good idea to widen them .
<2en> The EEAS will have to ensure that the EU is no longer merely an extension of the United States , because up to now , we have allowed the Americans to interfere in sensitive EU matters , such as the forced enlargement to include Turkey , and , as a result , have neglected important partners like Russia .
<2en> The world order no longer consists of these two powers alone ; there are also emerging powers like China .
<2en> We must not overlook that fact .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I am glad to welcome the formation of the European External Action Service after thorough and intricate debates .
<en> It is a long-awaited measure towards consolidating the position of the European Union as a proficient global actor .
<en> However , I am somewhat disappointed that although appointments to the EEAS will be made using a thorough selection procedure based on merit and having regard to gender and geographical balance , it still does not guarantee proportional representation of nationals of all Member States .
<en> It should be noted that while pooling human resources from the Commission , the Council and the Member States , one third from each , some Member States are still under-represented in the Commission and the Council , which might result in an implicit imbalance in the service .
<en> I fully agree that the service ought to be made up of competent professionals , but I am also more than sure that there are suitable candidates equally from both genders and from all the Member States .
<en> The fact that the European Union is an egalitarian organisation of 27 Member States should be clearly reflected in the composition of the European External Action Service in order to put our values into practice .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The final steps in creating the EEAS have been discussed today and will be voted tomorrow .
<en> There were tough negotiations between the three pillars of the Union : the Council , the Commission and the Parliament , so each , even if not completely satisfied , saw its main interests safeguarded .
<en> During the entire process , emphasis was placed inevitably on the national representation of the Member States in the staffing process .
<en> Things were not helped when , in spite of the ongoing negotiations to set its rules , the process continued unabated and , as a consequence , only some countries have seen their representatives getting the positions they were seeking .
<en> However , I think that the main challenge to the new service lies less in composition than in substance : if we want the members of the EEAS to be truly European , then we will have to provide them with a truly European foreign policy to implement .
<en> In that respect , both the multi-polar structure of the international system and the current crisis are important obstacles to be dealt with vigorously .
<en> Otherwise , the EEAS will only pursue the national objectives of the individual members .
<sp>
<2en> The European Parliament has proven to date that it clearly supports both the establishment and the swift commissioning of the European External Action Service .
<2en> I think that the compromise reached with the Council on Parliament 's rights is a satisfactory compromise for all concerned .
<2en> It makes sense and we need to have activity reports from the heads of the delegations during hearings before the competent parliamentary committee during the procedure of exchange with the Council .
<2en> The EEAS also needs the same internal auditor and authorising officer as the European Commission for the purposes of financial control .
<2en> Finally , it is important that the Member States have committed to fully supporting the EU in the enforcement of any budgetary liability of temporary servants and in agreeing to create separate lines for CFSP expenditure , at least for major missions .
<2en> We feel that the compromise achieved will help enormously in achieving more transparent , sound and effective administration of spending by the EEAS under the Community budget .

<2en> I voted against the Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation , not because I am against scientific cooperation between the Union and the Faroe Islands , but because I believe that pressure should start to be put on the Faroe Islands so that the repeated slaughter of pilot whales - almost 1 000 of them are killed each year - stops once and for all .
<2en> As long as these massacres are perpetrated , I shall , in future , vote against any agreement or financial aid arrangement between the European Union and the Faroe Islands .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Commission negotiated on behalf of the Union an agreement with the government of the Faroes on scientific and technological cooperation in June 2010 .
<en> I voted for this report which approves the proposal .
<sp>
<2en> The Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation , in force since July 2009 , has been a success and has played an important role for both parties .
<2en> Its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future .
<sp>
<2en> The entry into force of the Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation will enable the Faroe Islands to participate fully in the European Union 's Seventh Framework Programme for Research , Technological Development and Demonstration Activities .
<2en> Although the Faroes have a small research community , their researchers have already successfully participated in EU-funded projects .
<2en> They have expertise in research areas linked to the geographical location of the Faroe Islands , in particular , marine resources and the environment .
<2en> The agreement will enable these researchers to work in other areas , such as energy , food , agriculture , fisheries and biotechnologies .
<2en> Regular meetings will help to identify common priorities in terms of research , as well as the fields in which joint efforts may be of benefit to both parties .
<2en> Furthermore , the agreement will promote the mobility of students and researchers from higher education .
<sp>
<2en> The European Union has set itself ambitious targets in the field of technology and not only in the context of the Lisbon Strategy .
<2en> These objectives have now been reinforced in the plan for the near future , the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> This makes cooperation in science and technology even more important .
<2en> Against this background , we should welcome the fact that a series of agreements have been reached with other countries to promote this cooperation by means of workshops , meetings and seminars , for example .
<2en> This issue is of such great importance to the EU that a subsidy option has been made available within the Seventh Framework Programme for Research , Technological Development and Demonstration Activities .
<2en> Now we are about to renew our agreement with a group of islands in the North Atlantic , the Faroe Islands .
<2en> Unlike Denmark , the Faroes are not a member of the European Union and do not form part of the customs union .
<2en> Instead , they have created a single economic area with Iceland .
<2en> In order to encourage technological progress , I have voted in favour of renewing the agreement on scientific and technical cooperation with the Faroe Islands .

<2en> Article 228 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union empowers the Ombudsman to receive complaints from any citizen of the Union concerning instances of maladministration in the activities of the Union 's institutions or bodies .
<2en> These complaints submitted by EU citizens constitute an important source of information on possible infringements of EU law .
<2en> According to Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , ' every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially , fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions , bodies , offices and agencies of the Union ' .
<2en> In the context of the consultations provided for in Article 4 ( 4 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 , the Commission must establish a deadline for the third-party author of a document to reply , and it should exercise this power in a way that enables it to abide by its own deadlines .
<2en> Furthermore , the Commission cannot delay or obstruct the Ombudsman 's inquiries in cases involving issues of access to documents , and should respond to the Ombudsman without delay , so as to comply with its duty of sincere cooperation , as envisaged in the treaty .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Ombudsman offers an important service to Irish citizens .
<en> If they feel that the EU or government does not seem to be working for them , they always have the office of the Ombudsman to turn to , to seek redress .
<en> From my dealings with the office , I have found that they aid the Irish citizens thoroughly and professionally and by voting in favour for the passing of this report , it shows the faith I have in the office .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this report .
<en> I take the view that the Commission 's uncooperative attitude in this and other cases risks eroding citizens ' trust in the Commission and undermining the ability of the European Ombudsman and the European Parliament to adequately and effectively supervise the Commission , and that as such , it runs counter to the very principle of the rule of law upon which the European Union is founded .
<en> I support demands that the Commission give an undertaking to Parliament that it will fulfil its duty of sincere cooperation with the European Ombudsman in future .
<sp>
<2en> The role of the European Ombudsman is clearly defined as being to investigate complaints against the EU institutions and bodies .
<2en> Such powers mean greater transparency in the relations between the European institutions and the citizens , companies , associations and other bodies with a registered office in the EU .
<2en> The complaint submitted by the non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) in question in this report concerns access to documents in the Commission 's possession .
<2en> The Ombudsman gave the Commission a deadline of three months to submit a detailed opinion , but this occurred only after 15 months .
<2en> This behaviour means that the Commission breached its obligation to cooperate with the Ombudsman sincerely and in good faith during his inquiry , and was detrimental not only to interinstitutional dialogue , but also to the EU 's public image .
<2en> I believe that it is Parliament 's responsibility , as the only elected body of the EU , to safeguard and protect the independence of the Ombudsman in fulfilling his duties towards the European public .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this resolution because I agree with its criticism of the Commission for having prioritised the interests of the multinational company Porsche over the public 's right to access Parliament , Council and Commission documents .
<2en> This resolution criticises the Commission 's uncooperative attitude , which is detrimental to both interinstitutional dialogue and the EU 's public image .
<2en> My support for this resolution is based on the fact that I agree with its criticism of the daily lack of transparency by the Commission , which constantly infringes the principle of loyal cooperation between the European institutions through ' the general practice of delay and obstruction by the Commission in respect of the Ombudsman 's inquiries in cases involving access to documents ' .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report goes against the already adopted Stockholm Action Plan , a European Union initiative to maintain and develop an area of freedom , security and justice .
<2en> Despite the problems regarding the legal basis of these amendments , I decided to vote in favour of the report , as I believe that protection measures for the victims or potential victims of crime are a positive thing .
<2en> The possibility of enlarging the scope of a legal protection order from one Member State ( ' the issuing state ' ) to another Member State to which the protected person wishes to move ( ' the executing state ' ) is a significant advance towards the creation in practice of an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union , and this is an ideal which I share .
<sp>
<2en> Domestic violence is a violation of fundamental human rights and can affect anyone , irrespective of religion , colour or social status .
<2en> Romania saw a 35 % rise in domestic violence in 2009 compared with 2008 .
<2en> Indeed , in 2010 , it is reported that the number of cases of domestic violence is increasing .
<2en> Domestic violence incidents are estimated to affect 1 200 000 people every year , yet only 1 % of the victims of violence are brave enough to report it to the authorities .
<2en> The European Protection Order must be a strong instrument capable of providing a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States ' borders .
<2en> This will also include protection against acts of violence committed by groups of people and will apply to all victims of crime , such as victims of human trafficking , female genital mutilation , forced marriages , honour crimes , incest , gender-based violence , as well as witnesses and victims of terrorism and organised crime .
<2en> Member States must continue to ensure legal protection , limit the reasons for refusing to recognise or for rejecting a European Protection Order , set a 20-day deadline for the execution of an order and clarify the position with regard to victims who move from one Member State to another .
<sp>
<2en> I believe that the Council directive is very positive as it aims to create a true area of freedom , security and justice .
<2en> However , I share the concerns expressed by the rapporteurs , particularly regarding the technical omissions as well as the differences that they highlight between the Member States ' legal systems .
<sp>
<2en> I would like to congratulate Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio and Mrs Romero López on their excellent work .
<2en> Victims of crime who have the right to protection in one Member State will be guaranteed the same level of protection throughout the Union , thanks to the new European Protection Order ( EPO ) approved today , which extends the scope of legislation to include all victims of crime , not just victims of gender violence as originally proposed .
<2en> Protection measures exist within all EU Member States , but they become ineffective when victims cross borders .
<2en> The European Protection Order should ensure that any protection granted to a person in one Member State will apply in all the other Member States to which he or she travels or has travelled .
<2en> The European Protection Order may be issued at the request of persons under protection if they decide to move to another Member State , or if they simply wish to spend time there .
<2en> The Member State that issued the protection measure will be responsible for issuing an EPO and sending it to the Member State to which the person intends to travel .
<2en> The text still needs to be confirmed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council , and they will have three years to transpose it into national law .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The proposal for a directive on the European Protection Order , submitted by 12 Member States , is an initiative aimed at preventing crime .
<en> Even when Member States have provided for protection orders for victims , the resulting enforcement measures stop at the border of the issuing state .
<en> Victims , however , may move from one Member State to another for many reasons , not least to escape crime .
<en> Because they move in this way , they are defenceless when judicial and law enforcement cooperation fails to protect them by implementing a rapid , effective , Europe-wide early warning and prevention mechanism .
<en> Setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim behind this initiative .
<en> The action taken by Member States shows that crime can be prevented at European level when the aggressor or aggressors are identified .

<2en> It was a very special moment , last month , when all the political groups stepped up to the plate to achieve a political agreement , beyond the 2011 budget , on the future financing of the EU .
<2en> So , after all the hullabaloo they caused during the negotiations , the three main political groups gave in on the final straight .
<2en> The European Parliament , despite drawing on its new powers , has just passed up on the chance to impose itself in its role as a decision-maker on budgetary matters .
<2en> The Belgian Prime Minister 's letter shown to us by the Belgian Presidency and which guarantees that the Treaty will be respected ( sic ) and that Parliament will be involved with future discussions does not offer any guarantee for a good political outcome .
<2en> Our vote against reflects this missed opportunity and the rendezvous clause that will follow .
<2en> The best instrument for achieving this is , using the same method as the Convention , to bring together European and national parliaments , national governments and the European Commission .
<2en> As for the ITER mega project , which requires and will continue to require extortionate levels of funds , we are not sorry that it has been deferred .
<2en> We will again try and demonstrate the financial waste that it represents as soon as it is back on the table of the EP Committee on Budgets .
<sp>
<2en> We are about to approve the European Union budget for 2011 , which is being done , for the first time , in accordance with the new regime of the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> I am pleased with the affirmation of the role of the European Parliament in this matter , and support the main priorities highlighted in the document that we are voting on today .
<2en> In 2011 , special attention needs to be paid to the theme of Youth , Education and Mobility , a priority that has been taken into account in all sections of the budget .
<2en> We need to invest in our young people and in training for all European citizens , namely through the Lifelong Learning , Erasmus Mundus and Eures programmes .
<2en> It is also essential to promote investment in research and innovation , and the role of SMEs as an engine for making our economy more dynamic .
<2en> Considering the importance of the policy of cohesion as an overarching element of all European policies , I welcome its planned inclusion in the document that is key to the successful implementation of this policy .
<2en> Because of the reasons set out and because I believe that the European Union is going through a period that requires more effort in terms of making Europe stronger and more competitive , while retaining the need to strengthen inter-institutional dialogue , I am voting in favour of this draft presented by Parliament .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I have voted in favour of the report .
<en> In its negotiations with the Council , Parliament has shown its teeth .
<en> Last year , in the context of the Treaty of Lisbon , the Council made significant concessions to Parliament .
<en> In this decision on the budget , Parliament has moved towards the Council 's position .
<en> This compromise seems to be workable .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The 2011 budget has been decided in challenging and unstable times .
<en> At a time when we are seeing severe cuts being made to budgets in member states , it is now more important than ever to make sure Europe is providing the resources to deal with the effects of the crisis .
<en> The benefits of EU funding can be seen across my constituency , and provide help for those who will suffer because of the current ' slash and burn ' policy being implemented in the UK .
<en> However , there are parts of this budget I cannot agree with .
<en> For example I do not think it is appropriate to vote in favour of wasteful agricultural subsidies and an increase in entertainment expenses .
<en> I believe it is important in these uncertain economic times to show restraint in spending .
<en> It is for this reason I chose to abstain on budget 2011 .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Labour MEPs have voted against the budget package because , at a time when such severe cuts are being made to domestic public spending , we do not believe it is appropriate for the EU budget to increase .
<en> We certainly don 't support the way that many governments are risking their economies by slashing public spending .
<en> But that does not mean we should automatically support an increase in overall spending by the European Union .
<en> The EU will be doing a lot of important work next year , in many cases providing support to those areas that will be hardest hit by domestic cuts .
<en> However , where new expenditure is required , we believe it would have been possible to find savings to free up money for important projects .
<en> Given the current pressure on domestic economies , these budget negotiations could have been an opportunity to persuade EU leaders to tackle wasteful EU expenditure in areas such as agricultural subsidies , which often undermine the economies of the very countries that the EU 's international aid budget sets out to help .
<en> However , this budget package leaves those subsidies virtually untouched .
<en> Against this background , Labour MEPs could not support an increase in the EU budget .

<en> in writing . - ( HU ) The Europe 2020 Strategy not only pointed beyond the Lisbon Strategy at the time of its formulation , but had to be expressly adjusted to the new period of crisis ; what is more , it now also has to reflect upon the period of economic governance and the rescue of the euro .
<en> The new Member States must also make sure that they maintain sufficient freedom of movement and competitiveness in order to resolve the deepening structural and employment problems they have retained after the Eastern European changes of regime .
<en> Wrong decisions and serious governmental negligence in the past also require us to pay attention to the situation of families : the labour market does not only consist of employers and employees , but also of multi-generation families maintaining more or less close relations .
<en> These not only represent the foundation of society but also the key to its future .
<en> Closer cooperation between generations could in itself give a considerable boost to employment ( e.g. employment of young mothers , support to people with disabilities in finding work , maintaining the activity of the elderly , even in the civil sector ) , and common planning ( e.g. housing situation ) could also help avoid individual and family debt crises and bankruptcies , which are sufficient to force families into the grey economy due to high repayment instalments .
<en> This previous way is no longer feasible .
<en> New approaches will also be required , as the old formulas are no longer sufficient , and the European Union , too , must come to realise this .
<en> The EU must also support solutions which may seem unconventional at the moment .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Europe 2020 Strategy is one of the most important projects we 've created , yet , there is no guarantee of its success .
<en> We should include gender equality in all targets , flagship initiatives and national reforms - and women should be considered in all policy areas .
<en> The open method of coordination is a weak means to carry out common goals , therefore results will only come if there is real commitment !
<en> The Europe 2020 Strategy 's employment targets call for an increase in women 's employment .
<en> This , the reconciliation of work and family life and the elimination of gender stereotypes in the labour market are a must .
<en> We need to involve more women in vocational training , the sciences and educational fields that have been until now considered as ' masculine ' .
<en> We have to end the gender-based segregation of the labour market , especially when it comes to the new green jobs .
<en> Fully including women to the labour market is a way to put an end to the demographic crisis .
<en> If we provide secure and decent work , the means to reconcile work and family life and if we manage to include men more intensively in household duties , then all studies show that women would be more willing to bear children .

<en> If this will be the case , we will be able to produce more for the same or less energy consumption and create thousands of jobs which can not be outsourced .
<en> We have to make sure that smart energy does not remain a dream .
<en> We are building today a whole new energy infrastructure in Europe .
<en> We have to ensure this lessens the divide between Western and Central Europe in terms of sustainable jobs .
<en> A two-speed Europe on energy will not solve energy poverty or inefficiency .
<en> We should give a helping hand to those regions which are behind , even if it is not easy in today 's economic realities .
<en> We need a smart energy system for all European citizens at the same time .
<en> We must prevent a piecemeal system where some citizens only see the future 50 years after the others .
<en> Simply put , we need smart energy jobs for all Europeans , not just for those who would have received them even without Europe .

<en> in writing . - Straight away after the entry of Latvia to the EU , the Latvian government decided that for the allocation of resources from EU funds it was enough to declare Latvia to be one region .
<en> ( Poland is divided into 16 regions ) .
<en> As a result , one of the 4 regions of Latvia - Latgale - remains one of the most unprotected .
<en> Application of funds in Latgale is many times less efficient than in Latvia as a whole .
<en> This situation is reflected on the labour market of Latgale .
<en> While the unemployment rate in the capital city of Latvia ( Riga ) is 8-9 % , in Latgale it is 20-25 % .
<en> European employment programs are inaccessible to the population of such towns as Livani , Preili , Kraslava , Ludza , Aglona and Dagda .
<en> Instead of solving the issue of organisation and stimulation of production in Latgale , the Latvian government is continuously increasing taxes , which leads to widespread bankruptcy of small and medium-sized companies .
<en> To avoid social tension the inhabitants of Latgale are given LVL 100 per month as a sop .
<en> The common policy of the Latvian government has resulted in the emigration of more than 150 000 workers .

<2en> At last , the European Union has recognised the fundamental role of industry , calling for simplification of access to credit and a reduction in red tape .
<2en> In recent years , we have witnessed the adoption of measures which cause heavy burdens for European industry and which favour the unfair competition of products imported from third countries .
<2en> I would note the costs resulting from combating climate change and the measures aimed at reducing or eliminating duties .
<2en> The report highlights the importance of research as an instrument to fend off competition and notes the professional training of workers and the information that must be given to consumers .
<2en> Let us not forget , however , that aside from all the fine words , the EU is at risk of a rupture between Member States , which results in a minimal desire to create an industrial future together .
<2en> I am referring to what has happened with the European patent , which has seen the Union exclude Italy and Spain , and the use of enhanced cooperation amongst other Member States .
<2en> I voted in favour of this report since the principles it brings up are worthy of support .
<sp>
<2en> Industry in Europe is facing not only the effects of the economic crisis , but also the new challenges of the globalised era .
<2en> Businesses must react appropriately to ever faster changes in economic trends .
<2en> The economies of rising countries are altering the balance of forces in international markets .
<2en> With the development of a knowledge-based society , the role of scientific research and innovation is also being enhanced , these leading to economic growth and competitiveness .
<2en> The problems which the EU economy is having to face up to include demographic change and the downturn in productivity .
<2en> The main objectives for EU industry are a growth in competitiveness and innovativeness .
<2en> To achieve them , it is necessary to take a number of measures at the same time .
<2en> It is essential to continue work on the single market and harmonisation of customs and tax legislation .
<2en> The bureaucratic burden on businesses should be reduced and the legal framework simplified .
<2en> Cooperation between businesses should be strengthened through business clusters , networks and centres of excellence , and efforts should be made to promote synergies between universities and business .
<2en> It may also prove helpful to use alternative mechanisms such as public-private partnerships that share the risks between private and public investors , and to use leverage and the knock-on effect .
<2en> It will be crucial to support small and medium-sized enterprises , which form the basis of European industry , by financial assistance in the area of innovation and technology transfer and by involving innovative and sustainable criteria in tenders for public procurement .
<2en> It should not be forgotten to ensure a rise in spending on research based on cooperation between the public and private sector .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour of this report which highlights ways in which the EU 's industrial base may be strengthened .
<en> Industry provides roughly a third of employment in the EU , which is why it is so vital that we ensure its ongoing viability .
<sp>
<2en> European industry and its multiplier effect account for approximately a third of the EU 's gross value added , and it provides a livelihood for 57 million people .
<2en> It is necessary to create an industrial policy which fosters coordination between the Member States and their competitive potential , as expressed in the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> The relevance of this report at a time of economic recession shows that , despite its importance , this sector is relegated to the background .
<2en> This evidence requires a closer look at the challenges which European industry will have to face , particularly the restructuring and reorientation of its makeup , based on a global knowledge society through innovation and research , in order to address the competitiveness of emerging economies .
<2en> Aside from this , new dynamics , climate change , demographic shifts and the process of urbanisation / depopulation are developing .
<2en> Of the 15 points tabled by the rapporteur , I would like to highlight the measures that have an effect on small and medium-sized businesses ( SMEs ) , which are the real driving force of the EU growth .
<2en> The simplification of European procedures for obtaining funding , more and better information given to the SMEs about operational programmes , the creation of innovation clusters and networks , as well as greater support on the part of the European Central Bank , are key initiatives for the success of European industrial policy .
<sp>
<2en> In the vote on the Lange report , I am abstaining on paragraph 31 because of the ambiguous wording of the vote , which refers to Eurobonds as well as project bonds .
<2en> However , taking it as a whole , I am voting for the report , as I have nothing against project bonds in themselves .
<2en> Project bonds serve as finance for extensive innovation , infrastructure and reindustrialisation projects .
<2en> This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts , as would be the case with Eurobonds .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I supported this report as it sets out the need for a coherent policy on the future of industry across the EU .
<en> With over 60 million jobs in the EU generated by industrial manufacturing , a robust policy will help the EU overcome some of the challenges faced by manufacturers .
<en> Making up part of the EU 's 2020 strategy , this report outlines 15 ' cornerstones ' of a strong policy which will ensure that the EU can keep up with competitors from the US , China and Japan , who invest heavily in research and development into cutting-edge technology , and countries that are able to cut costs through cheap labour and have less stringent intellectual property rules .
<en> Some of the most useful recommendations in the report include the need for an innovation chain which links industry-related research to innovation and application of the technology , and an increased emphasis on resource efficiency and sustainability which ties in with the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy .
<sp>
<2en> I decided to vote in favour of the own-initiative report by Mr Lange since it represents Parliament 's contribution to the debate on an issue of utmost importance for the business world : European industrial policy .
<2en> The report has a number of positive aspects , such as the broad appeal to European enterprises to meet environmental standards , but only on a voluntary basis and without rigid impositions .
<2en> The central role of industry - and not just industrial policy - for the growth of the European Union is also correctly reiterated .
<2en> Now , taking our lead from the report that has been voted on today , I think it is important that all the institutions and interested parties strive to realise the objectives defined therein , translating them into real action .
<2en> Particularly important are : the adoption of measures for the protection of intellectual property ; the affirmation of an industrial innovation model that aims for excellence ; the modernisation of industries , particularly with regard to environmental protection and the careful use of energy resources ; and support for the creation of circumstances that assist in the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The free trade agreement between the European Union and the Gulf region is a priority for both parties ' interests and will emphasise the importance of their mutual recognition .
<2en> The presence of the European Union in the region strengthens trade policy , contributing to the development of targeted and effective information on the EU in the Gulf countries .
<2en> Concluding the agreement in question makes it possible to facilitate increased visibility for the Union by following a strategy of opening new European diplomatic missions in the Gulf states which would encourage political dialogue and make Europe 's efforts more effective .
<2en> This also applies in terms of the EU 's energy needs , still largely met by fossil fuels , even though future oil demand will be influenced by a climate policy increasingly focussed on renewable sources .
<2en> The social and political developments that have taken place in recent years in most Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) member states encourage the promotion of human rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination , including those based on gender , sexual orientation or religion .
<2en> A reliable partnership between the EU and the GCC therefore needs to be built , which will favour open markets for goods and the removal of non-tariff barriers .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The UK Conservative delegation and the ECR Group voted in favour of the Baudis Report on EU-GCC relations , including the extensive oral amendments submitted by the rapporteur today in plenary , as it is important to condemn any disproportionate use of force in Bahrain by the authorities , in particular allegations of the shooting of unarmed peaceful protestors .
<en> We accept that the mainly majority Shia community protestors have themselves in some measure also resorted to unacceptable violence and we call on all sides to exercise maximum restraint .
<en> Bahrain is a loyal western ally and home to the US Fleet and we welcome the offer of dialogue by the Crown Prince of Bahrain .
<en> We accept that under the GCC rules the government of Bahrain is entitled to call in Saudi and Kuwaiti assistance in enforcing law and order , but again foreign forces in Bahrain should respect fundamental human rights , including the right to peaceful demonstration .
<en> We hope an EU-FTA can be concluded as soon as possible as economic growth and job creation , particularly amongst the disadvantaged Shia community , will assist in stabilising the island state and reducing social tension .
<sp>
<2en> I supported the motion for a resolution which sends a clear signal to our partners in the Arab peninsula .
<2en> Against the backdrop of extreme economic , social and geopolitical tensions , it was essential that this House reiterate its willingness to review our cooperation agreements in light of the events in the Arab world .
<2en> We are not suggesting abandoning historic links , but rather adjusting our relations to reflect the realities on the ground and the needs of the people , making respect for the values championed by the Union a prerequisite for developing economic and political links .
<2en> Dialogue with civil society will also be a key and indispensable feature of each partnership .
<2en> Whilst progress and reforms must be welcomed , a lot remains to be done in order to set these countries firmly on the road to democracy , respect for human rights and civil liberties .
<2en> Part of Europe 's destiny is being played out in the Near and Middle East .
<2en> Under the association agreements concluded between the Union and these countries , we now need to find a middle way that is fair to all sides , balancing the pursuit of economic and trade relations against promoting core values .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) I voted in favour of the report on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council .
<en> As thoroughly explained in the report , due to the many advantages for both contractual parties and after 20 years of negotiations , it is time that we made a targeted effort to push for the conclusion of a free trade agreement .
<en> Above all , however , I support the main points of focus for the negotiations stated in the report , which take account of developments in the area of climate change and the obligation in terms of human rights .
<sp>
<2en> I am in favour of this appointment because all the legal procedures have been carried out , including a rigorous Curriculum Vitae assessment .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Commission 's original proposal for a consumer rights directive was an unwelcome , unnecessary attempt to enforce maximum harmonisation for no apparent reason other that to satisfy those who believe that cultural and legal diversity runs counter to the EU 's principles .
<en> The proposal would have led to a reduction in consumer rights in various European countries and there was no evidence it would have benefitted the market .
<en> The compromise package agreed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is far from perfect but marks a significant improvement and a base upon which we can build in negotiations with the other institutions .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DA ) I am pleased that , after more than two years of negotiations in Parliament , we have succeeded in agreeing on a position which both strengthens consumer rights in the EU and makes it easier for enterprises to operate on the internal market .
<en> On account of the decision to vote on the amendments in blocks , many of us are unhappy about the fact that we were not able to vote against certain amendments .
<en> Allow me to highlight the following cases .
<en> Chapters 4 and 5 : I would have liked a compromise , with Chapters 4 and 5 being completely removed from the proposal .
<en> I know that the Council in particular , but also the European Consumers ' Organisation ( BEUC ) and the Danish Consumer Council , would have preferred that to the compromise we currently have with regard to these two chapters .
<en> In this connection , we have to smile at the fact that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have chosen to ignore the recommendations of the consumer organisations .
<en> Article 22a : I would also have liked to delete the much-criticised Article 22a .
<en> It does not make things particularly easy for small and medium-sized enterprises .
<en> However , I am more confident than my fellow Liberal Members from Germany that we will probably succeed in amending this provision during the negotiations with the Council .
<en> One idea was to bring this article into line with Article 20 of the Services Directive , which would also reduce the risk of contradictory legislation .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( RO ) According to the EU 2020 Strategy , high-quality and environmentally sustainable production is one of the EU 's competitive advantages .
<en> A high level of consumer protection guarantees high-quality products and improves consumer confidence , thereby making the internal market more effective .
<en> I welcome the proposals tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on a new consumer rights directive as they strive to ensure transparency for companies , with the aim of unlocking the potential of cross-border trade in the EU .
<en> The new consumer rights regulations include almost every type of sales , in stores , via telephone or online .
<en> They reinforce in particular the provisions on international sales , based on the proposals made in the report drafted by my colleague Andreas Schwab .
<en> Unlike the four existing consumer protection directives , I think that the new legislation provides added value because it stipulates what kind of information the purchaser must receive from the seller , the delivery terms and the rules applied when the risk lies with the purchaser , not to mention the latter 's right to cancel or refuse purchases or the right to have an item repaired or replaced .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted to send this report back to committee because the Commission 's response to Parliament 's amendments was woefully inadequate .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) The Commission 's proposal aims to improve the functioning of the internal market by reducing trade barriers across borders , but poses problems for both consumers and manufacturers .
<en> It should support all efforts aimed at making the internal market more effective and encourage cross-border trade , but Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights requires that EU policies ensure a high level of consumer protection .
<en> It is therefore necessary to aim to increase the minimum level of current harmonisation by applying available best practices .
<en> It will be appropriate to develop a European system of liability in the event of non-compliance to improve consumer protection and confidence in the markets .
<en> In line with the Europe 2020 Strategy , their high level of protection ensures quality products and at the same time fosters the performance of the internal market .
<en> Regarding the rights of consumers , the current minimum regulations allow Member States to adapt European regulations to national principles : we should proceed further in this direction .
<en> Unfortunately however , we note that the proposed directive does not take into account new products on the market due to changes taking place in development and innovation , as in the case of digital products .

<sp>
<2en> I would like to express my solidarity with the Japanese people following the earthquake and the tsunami that occurred in March in northeast Japan .
<2en> Serious flaws in the operation of nuclear power plants are raising fears of a nuclear disaster and forcing us to rethink nuclear safety standards in Europe .
<2en> I would like to call for a serious discussion about the need for safe nuclear energy in Europe and about the fact that Europe needs this source of energy .
<sp>
<2en> Japan is overwhelmed today .
<2en> One nuclear accident after another is coming on top of a natural disaster .
<2en> This crisis is the most serious crisis that Japan has experienced since the Second World War .
<2en> The victims number tens of thousands , and the material damage is considerable and still difficult to quantify .
<2en> The European Union must deliver a response equal to the seriousness of the crisis .
<2en> Japan has urgent need of aid .
<2en> We urge the Commission to drive and coordinate the European solidarity effort .
<2en> Europe 's action must be clear , rapid and efficient in the short and long term .
<2en> As regards the Fukushima power station , European unease is legitimate .
<2en> The European executive must respond to this by asking for a series of crash tests to be carried out in an independent and transparent way on all of Europe 's nuclear infrastructure .
<2en> Finally , we cannot pass by without a collective reflection on our energy policy .
<2en> On energy saving , renewable energy sources , the energy efficiency criterion , we expect ambitious and conclusive decisions from Europe , as we do on European research , often well below 3 % of GDP .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this motion for a resolution as I think that the European Parliament and European Union as a whole must show their solidarity in response to the tragic events which have occurred in Japan .
<2en> The EU and its Member States must respond promptly in giving the humanitarian aid needed to help the Japanese population overcome the impact of the earthquake .
<2en> I also believe that it is paramount that the particularly serious nuclear accident caused by this natural disaster is investigated properly so as to avoid the possibility of such incidents occurring in the future .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution , which shows solidarity with the victims of the earthquake , the tsunami and the nuclear accident that have devastated Japan , and which calls upon the EU and its Member States to extend all possible aid and support needed at a humanitarian , technical and financial level to the regions affected , as a matter of urgency .
<sp>
<2en> On 11 March , Japan was hit by a massive earthquake , followed by a tsunami that has caused the greatest nuclear crisis in the country 's history , with the Fukushima nuclear plant suffering serious structural damage , and since then having been in imminent danger of triggering a nuclear disaster of major proportions .
<2en> This disaster has caused thousands of deaths and is the greatest tragedy to take place in Japan since World War II .
<2en> At this time I would like to join with this House in passing a vote of complete solidarity with the Japanese people , and I would like to express my condolences to the families of the victims and all those who were affected by this disaster of unimaginable proportions .

<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Violence against women is an evil in our society that we must fight at all costs .
<en> However , I cannot support this note given what is in my opinion the excessive attention it pays to female immigrants .
<en> Particularly at this time , such attention on the part of the EU and its governments should be highly visible , , and should not be confined to fine words in support of European projects .
<sp>
<2en> My group is divided on the matter .
<2en> I voted in favour of Amendment 19 and recital J on the word ' prostitution ' because I am of the opinion that prostitution is indeed an act of violence against women .
<sp>
<2en> Violence against women is a reality all too often overlooked : it is thought that between 20 and 25 % of European women will have already been subjected to physical violence at least once in their adult life .
<2en> Last week , the European Parliament adopted a report on this issue and on the need to establish a political framework in this area and I , for one , welcome it .
<2en> Our report seeks to encourage all EU Member States to consider violence against women a crime and hence to establish an instrument under criminal law to combat this violence .
<2en> Moreover , and importantly , I voted for the introduction of a mechanism to facilitate access to free legal aid , and for urgent psychological aid services to be provided free of charge for victims .
<2en> I also supported the amendments recognising the ' serious problem of prostitution ' and which consider that ' violence against women ' encompasses prostitution .
<2en> Lastly , I voted in favour of rape and sexual violence being considered a crime , even within marriage or any other type of intimate relationship .
<sp>
<en> in writing . -- ( IT ) A European regulatory framework in the fight against violence against women represents one crucial step forward within a comprehensive strategy .
<en> Only a combination of legal , social , economic and preventive actions will manage to resolve this problem which is rather close to home , given that over a quarter of women in the European Union have experienced violence during their lifetime .
<en> Violence against women makes no distinction by age or ethnic or cultural background , and it remains an invisible problem that has nonetheless very high human , social and economic costs .
<en> The European Union must affirm its active role in fighting discrimination against women and that is why the Svensson report supports the European Commission in its attempts to create a clear and homogenous regulatory framework in the context of the Stockholm Programme .
<en> I am therefore in favour of the request for an instrument of criminal law which would define violence against women as a crime in itself , through the development of a directive against gender-based violence , to be brought in line with the multiple training , prevention and awareness-raising initiatives in order to fight all forms of abuse against women .
<sp>
<2en> I gave this report my vote , because in the 21st century it is vital that we ensure that rape is considered a crime everywhere in Europe and that the perpetrators of these crimes face criminal prosecution and punishment .
<2en> It is not acceptable that at present , depending on which country they live in , not all victims of these hateful crimes enjoy the same opportunities to obtain justice and reparation for the violence done to them .
<2en> The ball is now in the court of the Council and Commission , who surely will not prevent this crucial step towards helping women who are victims of this violence to obtain reparation for their suffering .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Today , the European Parliament adopted an important document on the legal framework for European statistics on tourism .
<2en> The Member States must provide a regular set of data on the capacity and occupancy of accommodation establishments and on tourism demand .
<2en> As European travel habits change ( e.g. the increase in short haul flights ) , and the tourism sector switches over to certain innovations ( e.g. online bookings ) , it is necessary to update the legal framework , regulating the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism .
<2en> However , in my opinion , a particularly important provision , supported by the European Parliament , concerns the collection of data regarding people with limited mobility , and its impact on the ability of such people to obtain fully-fledged tourism services .
<2en> We constantly discuss improving quality of life for disabled people and we must include tourism in this area .
<2en> Only then will we be able to implement tourism policy effectively and protect the rights of consumers .
<sp>
<2en> The report by Mr Simpson on European statistics on tourism is a text that will replace the directive on the matter , which is now 15 years ' old .
<2en> Moving with the times and redrafting its regulations is a prerogative of the European system , particularly in view of the importance and continuous development of the tourism sector in Europe over the last decade .
<2en> That is why I voted in favour of the report .
<2en> New requirements in the sector , which needs increasingly detailed , up-to-date and comparable data , make it essential to update tourism statistics .
<2en> Access to facilities , services for disabled people and costs for essential goods are key data that require an up-to-date database that users can consult .
<sp>
<2en> Tourism is of huge economic importance in the EU , and mechanisms that contribute to promoting it are desirable and should be encouraged .
<2en> Statistics play an important role in developing more effective tourism policy at European , national , regional and local level .
<2en> Indeed , they are a useful instrument for supporting the decision-making process in businesses and the private sector .
<2en> This regulation is aimed at establishing a common legislative framework for the systematic production of European statistics on tourism by means of the collection , compilation , processing and transmission by the Member States of harmonised European statistics on tourism supply and demand .
<2en> This proposal should improve the timeliness , comparability and completeness of the statistics transmitted , as well as the efficiency of the data processing , including improved data evaluation .
<2en> This regulation also adapts the legal framework to reflect the latest changes in the tourism industry through the introduction of new variables , such as tourist movements over the course of a single day .
<2en> I voted in favour of the report for those reasons .
<sp>
<2en> Tourism is an important economic activity in the EU .
<2en> Statistics are helpful for monitoring specific policies for tourism and are useful in the context of regional policies and sustainable development .
<2en> Within the EU , the tourism statistics system is governed by Directive 95 / 57 / EC .
<2en> However , since the entry into force of this directive , the tourism industry and relative demand have changed significantly .
<2en> The Commission has therefore set out a new proposed regulation aimed at establishing a policy framework for tourism by making use of the powers introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
<2en> Its goal is to update and streamline the regulatory framework applicable to the European statistics on tourism in order to take into account the latest trends in the area .
<2en> In this regard , it is necessary to not only strengthen the tourism sector through coordinated action at EU level , but also to create a common framework for the systematic production of statistics through the collection , compilation , processing and reporting by Member States of harmonised European statistics on supply and demand in the sector .
<2en> On the basis of the aforementioned , I hereby give my favourable vote to the proposed regulation .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted in favour .
<en> Tourism is an important economic activity in the EU , with a high potential for contributing to greater employment and economic growth , as well as for playing an important role in socio-economic integration in rural , peripheral and less-developed areas , such as areas rich in industrial heritage .
<en> Statistics in this field are not only used to monitor tourism-specific policies , but also play a role in the wider context of regional policy and sustainable development .
<en> In the EU , Directive 95 / 57 / EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism organises the system of tourism statistics .
<en> Eurostat publishes these statistics , which are collected and compiled by national statistical authorities .
<en> In order to successfully implement the new policy framework , policy makers at all levels of governance need to take well-informed decisions , based on reliable and comparable statistical data .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur that European political parties are basic instruments of parliamentary democracy , even if , at this stage , they are only umbrella organisations of the affiliated national parties .
<2en> I also support the idea that only those parties represented by at least one MEP are eligible for funding .
<2en> I believe that the idea of asking the Commission to propose a draft statute for European political parties , in accordance with the TFEU , is correct .
<2en> I advocate , along with the rapporteur , that we need changes to the financial regulations governing the funding of European parties and political foundations , and that funding must be allocated in full at the start of the year .
<sp>
<2en> It is a sentiment shared by all European citizens and , at this level , whether you are pro-Europe or against the integration of Europe changes nothing .
<2en> There is an urgent need to re-appropriate European issues .
<2en> Political parties at European level have considerable scope for action .
<2en> They must devise fresh perspectives and give fresh impetus to the instruments of a democratic Europe .
<2en> We must therefore relax the conditions under which political parties at European level exist in order to release energies .
<2en> We need to give a clear status to these new spaces for debate and , finally , a genuine perspective to the activity of political parties at European level in the forthcoming elections .
<sp>
<2en> I rejected this report for a number of reasons .
<2en> Many of the proposals on the direct funding and status of European political parties conflict with the national parties .
<2en> MEPs are elected by the various countries via national parties .
<2en> After their election , thanks to their national parties , they can form European groups , but while pursuing their party interests domestically .
<2en> This report does not support this idea .
<sp>
<2en> The development of European political parties is vital for generating public interest in EU affairs .
<2en> Dealing with the issue of regulating European parties is a deeper concern , linked to how to create a transnational civic space composed of free and equal citizens , and what a ' collective founding ' , in the form of a ' civic contract ' among diverse peoples , might entail for the future of integration .
<2en> Devising a reform package for European political parties as a means of mobilising the democratic energies of individual and organised citizens is not an easy task , not least due to the EU 's systemic complexity .
<2en> Strengthening European political parties is a means of enhancing participatory governance in the EU and , ultimately , of strengthening democracy .
<2en> The EU 's future rests on European political parties , complicated as it sounds .
<2en> Creating a safe and transparent environment for the operation and funding of European political parties marks a first step .
<2en> We need a European space where political parties actively put citizens at the heart of the European Union 's concerns and help them in their everyday life , at a time when it is noticeable that European citizens are detached from the Union .
<sp>
<2en> European political parties , which play an important role in shaping democracy in the EU , should be given a common and uniform legal statute .
<2en> European political parties should be bodies with legal personality , in order to be capable of overcoming the difference between European political parties and European authorities , from the perspective of taxation procedures .
<2en> As far as the establishment of European parties is concerned , it is right and proper that the statute of European parties regards European , national and regional elected representatives as being equal , as long as the regional representatives are elected members of regional parliaments .
<2en> In addition to this , every European political party should have at least one representative who is a Member of the European Parliament .
<2en> In the end , that is also a condition for a European political party to qualify for funding from the European Parliament .

<sp>
<en> in writing . - The Kalniete report rightly emphasises the importance of authorities below the Member State government level in implementing rules relating to the Single Market .
<en> I fully support this sentiment and consider that , when Scotland wins back her independence , it will be appropriate for those levels of government below the Scottish national government to be fully involved in implementing Single Market rules .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for this report because it proposes adopting a directive that would involve national governments and regional authorities more in the drawing up of a new directive , through consultation with employers , unions and other associations .
<2en> It calls on the Commission to indicate the implementation timetable for the Single Market Act and to publish regular updates of tangible progress in order to make the EU public more aware of the Act 's implementation and highlight its benefits .
<2en> It is proposed that partnership with local and regional authorities needs to be broadened from cohesion policy to Single Market policies .
<2en> Single market rules are very often implemented and enforced by Member States ' authorities at regional or local levels .
<2en> The experience with the implementation of the Services Directive has clearly shown that involvement of regional and local authorities can be extremely important for ensuring that Single Market legislation is properly implemented and applied .
<2en> The dialogue and partnership element of Single Market governance should be strengthened through stronger involvement by national parliaments .
<2en> The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon offers a window of opportunity for the national parliaments to engage with Single Market rules throughout the legislative cycle and participate in joint activities with the European Parliament .
<2en> This could speed up the adoption of subsequent transposition measures at Member State level .
<2en> A constant exchange of information with national parliaments on the progress of transpositions could also facilitate the transposition process .
<sp>
<2en> All measures aimed at the development and integration of Member States are worthy of attention .
<2en> There is no doubt that the current system of economic cooperation - the European Union Single Market - makes life easier for all citizens , among other things , by lifting trade barriers and enabling the free flow of people .
<2en> However , new proposals need to be introduced successively to prevent stagnation occurring within the system .
<2en> Let us consider whether political leadership would not be a good idea for revitalising the Single Market .
<2en> The President of the Council of the European Union , working together with the President of the European Commission , would be authorised to coordinate and supervise this process of revitalisation while maintaining , however , the involvement of the Member States .
<2en> Partnership as a factor in managing the Single Market should be based on dialogue with the parliaments of Member States , and also on cooperation with local and regional authorities .
<2en> Working together would help in implementing directives properly and would produce the expected results .
<sp>
<2en> I support the final form of the report on governance and partnership in the Single Market , and especially its key priorities .
<2en> In my opinion , regular assessment of the situation on the internal market will improve the way it functions .
<2en> A better functioning internal market is also promised from the more broadly conceived , more interactive and more transparent public consultations of the draft legislation .
<2en> If we can persuade Member States to publish comparison tables for legislation relating to the Single Market , there is a chance that we will be able to reduce the deficit in the implementation of directives relating to the Single Market to 0.5 % in the case of legislation not yet adopted , and to 0.5 % in the case of legislation incorrectly implemented .
<2en> However , the fundamental precondition for success is for the Commission to take a more active approach towards enforcing the transposition of EU law than is currently the case , for example , with the directive on services on the internal market .
<2en> This directive is one of the cornerstones of a functioning internal market .
<2en> Unfortunately , however , many states have implemented it late and often incorrectly , in a bid to apply the principles of economic nationalism , and the Commission turns a blind eye to this .
<2en> I have voted for the adoption of this report .
<sp>
<2en> The report I have supported embodies many of the principles which I personally consider foundational for the European Union .
<2en> I refer , in general terms , to the type of dialogue that must be established as soon as possible between citizens and institutions at different levels .
<2en> This dialogue takes on specific and diverse connotations in relation to the life of all of us Europeans , but it becomes much more relevant when one considers the creation of a Single Market aimed at revitalising the entire European economy and improving communications between legislative bodies and the direct beneficiaries .
<2en> I think the priorities in our pursuit of shared growth should be to proceed in this direction , while looking at new methods of governance and monitoring various kinds of procedures while , at the same time , streamlining our citizens ' access to public administration .

<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I abstained from the vote on this document , although the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union ( FRONTEX ) for the financial year 2009 .
<en> The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> I abstained because the European Parliament is concerned that the Court of Auditors has reported carry-overs which were already reported in its 2006 , 2007 and 2008 annual reports , and regrets , in particular , the high level of carry-overs and cancellations since 2006 .
<en> The Court of Auditors also reported , for the second year running , that the Agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the Agency , while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument .
<en> The Court of Auditors reported the overstatement by 27 % of the costs for pre-financing to border authorities in the 8 cases audited .
<en> For the activities which ended in 2009 , more than 40 recovery orders had to be issued to recover advances made in excess .
<en> The Agency 's budget for the year 2009 was nearly 28 % greater than the previous year .
<en> I believe that the observations made and concern expressed must be taken into account and appropriate action taken .
<sp>
<2en> Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels : internal control , within each institution ; external control , carried out by the European Court of Auditors ; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament .
<2en> I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of Frontex 's budget for the financial year 2009 because the audits carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that the Agency 's transactions were all perfectly legal and regular .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted to give discharge to Frontex , but observe that the Court of Auditors reported , for the second year running , that the agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the agency , while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument .
<en> I note that the amount paid out was more than EUR 28 000 000 in 2009 , and was EUR 17 000 000 in 2008 .
<en> I welcome , nevertheless , the agency 's initiative , made in response to the Court 's observation , of signing a framework Partnership Agreement with Member State border authorities .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - This grants the Executive Director of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency 's budget for the financial year 2009 .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( IT ) Through today 's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency 's budget for the financial year 2009 .
<en> Parliament underlines that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<en> Parliament calls on the Agency to improve its financial management with regard to the reimbursement of costs incurred by Member States by identifying , with those Member States , the roots of the problem so as to adopt shared solutions .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the SESAR Joint Undertaking because that recently formed undertaking has convinced the Court of Auditors of its reliability .
<2en> The effort that the institution is making to complete the implementation of its internal control systems is already well known , but I think further endeavours ought to be made in this area in order to guarantee the transparency and reliability of the accounts .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( PT ) This Joint Undertaking aims to modernise the European air traffic management system , and it should bring together the Union 's efforts towards research and development under the scope of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management ( ATM ) Research ( SESAR ) .
<en> The safety of Europeans , who increasingly use the services of airlines , as well as of airline employees , necessitates a particular level of performance in seeking the best solutions for managing this type of traffic , as well as monitoring and comparing the methodologies already applied in the various Member States , with a view to everyone adopting the best practices and safe , economical and innovative solutions .
<en> As with other companies in their early life , SESAR has not yet completely put its internal controls or its financial information systems in full working order .
<en> It will need to do so as soon as possible .
<sp>
<2en> I endorsed this document , because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009 .
<2en> The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
<2en> The Joint Undertaking final 2009 budget included commitment appropriations of EUR 325 000 000 and payment appropriations of EUR 157 000 000 , and the utilisation rates for commitment and payment appropriations were 97.1 % and 43.2 % respectively .
<2en> The Court of Auditors found that important steps were taken in 2009 to establish control systems , but expresses concern that an integrated tool to manage financial , budget and operational information was not in place at year-end .
<2en> However , in response the Joint Undertaking stated that financial systems were ready and in place by May 2010 .
<2en> Cases where internal controls do not operate correctly must be eliminated .
<sp>
<2en> Notwithstanding a few gaps and irregularities revealed by the Court of Auditors during its analysis and assessment of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking , I voted in favour of granting discharge for the financial year 2009 .
<2en> However , I think that , in order to avoid the same mistakes being made in future procedures , SESAR should complete and implement internal control systems and a financial information system which would allow for the most reliable and accurate assessment possible of the budgetary transactions for each financial year .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009 .
<en> Nevertheless , I am concerned that an integrated management system - allowing costs to be allocated to specific work packages and funding sources for operational costs to be identified - was not in place by December 2009 .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report sends a clear message : the European Union must incorporate a consistent and coordinated cultural strategy into its foreign policy .
<2en> The bonds that unite more specifically Europe and the countries south of the Mediterranean are going through deep changes .
<2en> A wind of freedom is blowing on the Arab world .
<2en> Culture is a significant asset .
<2en> It contributes to a lively and long-lasting democracy .
<2en> Cultural and educational exchanges encourage the emergence of an organised civil society .
<2en> Cultural cooperation is also one of the keys to the Union 's success for the Mediterranean .
<2en> It leads nations to share and interact with one another , respect and better understand each other every day .
<sp>
<2en> It was important for the European Parliament to provide a strong reminder of how much we must promote diversity , heritage and cultural exchanges in all the EU 's external actions .
<2en> As a creator of integration , tolerance and mutual comprehension , culture is an essential component of our societies which we must promote in our diplomatic efforts in favour of human rights and democracy .
<2en> This report emphasises , however , that the cultural dimension of external actions still remains underdeveloped and undercoordinated , and that it is necessary to adopt a common and coherent strategy in this area .
<2en> We have also renewed our support for a free Internet by condemning Internet censorship and the threats that it poses to human rights , as well as to access to and sharing of global cultural heritage .
<2en> While European citizens share a range of common cultural values , we will be best placed to serve European interests if we speak with a common voice .
<sp>
<2en> The European Union is known for its variety of cultural forms .
<2en> In my opinion , European values such as respect for human rights , democracy and fundamental freedoms , are also conveyed by our cultural products .
<2en> Knowledge and international skills , as indicated in the EU 2020 strategy , are critical to the education systems .
<2en> Multilingualism , e-skills and cultural awareness allow us to seize many opportunities offered by today 's global labour market .
<2en> Culture should therefore be integrated across the board in the wide spectrum of actions that make up the EU 's foreign policy .
<2en> A coherent , coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU 's external actions does not currently exist .
<2en> We also see fragmentation and diffusion , not only between Member States , but also between different departments and institutions of the European Union .
<2en> This fragmentation , without a common strategy , prevents the efficient use of resources and budget allocations for the cultural sector .
<2en> I therefore urge the Commission to consider the integration and simplification of culture both in the EU 's external actions and within the European institutions .
<sp>
<2en> I support this report by my group colleague because it underlines the cross-cutting nature and the importance of culture in all aspects of life , and argues that culture needs to be taken into consideration in all EU external policies .
<sp>
<2en> I consider the cultural aspect of European policies which strives for increased European cohesion important .
<2en> I therefore welcome all cultural programmes whose objective is to create a European identity from shared values and mutual understanding .
<2en> As such , I believe in the power that certain cultural initiatives can have on relations within the Union , as well as diplomatic relations with third countries .
<2en> The cultural elements of the various countries can be used as bridges towards peaceful cooperation with a view to stability .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The evolution of our model of development , focused from now on on the knowledge economy , makes culture a strategically important sector .
<2en> I welcome the adoption of this report , which proposes ways of making better use of European cultural resources .
<2en> In my view , unlocking the potential of creative industries must particularly involve a reform of the European system of managing copyright , in order to enable the creative industries to draw a greater benefit from the single market .
<2en> Licensing procedures , as the report emphasises , are far too complicated , and it calls for the introduction of a one-stop shop for the clearance of rights .
<2en> It is also necessary , I believe , to stimulate creation by adopting a specific tax system for innovative products , such as digital cultural content .
<2en> It is not right that these products should be subject to VAT at the full standard rate while other cultural products benefit from tax reliefs .
<2en> With my vote , I wanted to call on the Commission and the Council to respond to the European Parliament 's demand for specific measures to enable us to enjoy the full benefit from the growth potential of this sector .
<2en> Only an ambitious and joint approach can preserve the uniqueness of European culture .
<sp>
<2en> I voted for Mrs Sanchez-Schmid 's report on the potential of the European cultural and creative industries , which has not yet been fully unlocked .
<2en> These industries are an asset for the EU , partly because their exponential growth over the past 25 years has created tens of thousands of jobs .
<2en> It is therefore necessary to build a European strategy for these industries in which they have the opportunity to express their potential and gain recognition for their dual role as bearers of culture and entertainment and as creators of business and jobs .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting for this motion for a resolution , and would express the same conviction as the rapporteur that awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending historical European divisions and showcasing the new Europe .
<sp>
<2en> I endorsed this resolution .
<2en> The European Capitals of Culture project helps to support the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share , as well as to promote greater mutual understanding between European citizens .
<2en> Although the decision on the European Capital of Culture for the years 2007 to 2019 applies only to the EU Member States , I agree with the resolution 's call to award the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014 .
<2en> I believe that this would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions by awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century .
<sp>
<2en> Anyone who followed with horror the events that made victims of the inhabitants of the martyr city of Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia , and which damaged its buildings , cannot fail to welcome the city 's designation as European Capital of Culture 2014 .
<2en> Without forgetting what happened , I hope that this event will enable Europeans to have other , more agreeable memories of Sarajevo , and that it will contribute , above all , to bringing together the various ethnic groups of the country itself .
<2en> I hope that the programme of Sarajevo Capital of Culture will celebrate life , and the human capacity for survival and rebuilding , and that it will prove to all of us the extent to which the human spirit can cultivate and transmit the good and the beautiful , even after experiencing the most profound suffering .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This resolution addresses Bosnia and Herzegovina 's application for its capital , Sarajevo , to be considered European Capital of Culture in 2014 .
<2en> The EU initiative ' European Capital of Culture ' was created to highlight Europe 's cultural richness and diversity , sharing it out and promoting mutual understanding amongst Europeans .
<2en> In 1992-1996 , Sarajevo - the martyr city where , in 1914 , the First World War started - would become the victim of destruction during the time it was besieged .
<2en> It now has images that are known the world over , like the one of ' The Cellist of Sarajevo ' who , dressed in black and in the midst of the destruction of war , wanders the streets seeking to ease the suffering of a martyred people who cannot leave the city .
<2en> Despite adversity , the city maintains its cultural spirit .
<2en> I consider it positive and fair that Sarajevo be European Capital of Culture .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this document because a Community action entitled European Capital of Culture has been established in order to highlight the richness and diversity of European cultures and the features they share , as well as to promote greater mutual understanding between Europeans .
<2en> In addition , it is noted that Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture and will commemorate several important anniversaries in 2014 , and the City Council of Sarajevo and local cultural operators have undertaken extensive preparations in their candidature for this title .
<2en> I therefore believe that the Council should award the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014 .
<2en> This would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions and showcasing the new Europe by awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted for this resolution which calls on the Council to award the title ' European Capital of Culture ' exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014 .
<en> I believe that awarding the title to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions and showcasing the new Europe .
<sp>
<2en> Sarajevo was a magnificent city in which three peoples , three cultures and three religions cohabited .
<2en> The siege of the city and the ethnic and religious war which lasted for four years ( 1992-1996 ) profoundly disrupted this capital , which was ' Islamised ' in religious terms and ' Bosniakised ' in linguistic terms .
<2en> Our challenge now is to rebuild the bridges between the communities .
<2en> Culture can contribute to this .
<2en> By the way , it was culture that helped them to endure four years of war .
<2en> Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies , counteracting every nationalist reaction , racist temptation and exclusion .
<2en> It can help them now to achieve European multiculturalism once again .
<2en> This mosaic-like city was and can once more become the living metaphor for Europe .
<2en> We must work to create a pluralistic world that keeps its capacity for creation intact and that is able to give rise to novelty and diversity .
<sp>
<2en> I am using my vote in favour to express my support for the European Parliament 's call to the Council for Sarajevo to be named European Capital of Culture in 2014 .
<2en> In fact , I agree with what the resolution says about how awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events during the 20th century represents an important step towards overcoming Europe 's past divisions and promoting the new Europe .

<2en> Divergences in European contract law end up discouraging businesses from engaging in cross-border trade and keep them from benefiting from opportunities and gains which the Internal Market offers .
<2en> Consequently , consumers are also disadvantaged by limited product choice , higher prices and lower quality due to weak cross-border competition .
<2en> In this regard , we wish to introduce some innovations , including business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties ' choice , and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments .
<2en> Simplicity and readiness for use should be a key objective .
<2en> Provisions on sale of goods merit priority , as do service contracts .
<2en> Finally , the introduction of a trust mark system would ensure additional consumer protection .
<2en> Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , and consumers .
<sp>
<2en> Although I believe that there is still a lot to be done in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) and of consumer rights , this report is a first step in facilitating cross-border trade between SMEs .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - Labour Euro MPs want to see improvements in the Single Market and to facilitate cross-border transactions for consumers and small businesses .
<en> However , consumer and business groups have come together on this issue to reject Mrs Wallis ' proposal of an optional instrument of contract law .
<en> They maintain that rules of national contract law are not a factor in influencing consumer attitudes to buying from another Member State ; in fact , there are other genuine barriers to cross-border trade , such as administrative and cultural differences and a lack of effective means of redress for consumers .
<en> Mrs Wallis has failed to provide compelling evidence of the need for an optional instrument .
<en> Indeed , such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer rights .
<en> We need to take time and evaluate the seven options in the Green Paper and make an evidence-based decision on the basis of clear impact assessments .
<en> Similarly , we cannot accept the ECR toolbox-based approach without sufficient evidence and impact assessment to demonstrate that this is the best way to protect consumers and help businesses .
<en> We owe it to our consumers and businesses to make the right decision for them and ensure that any change of law affecting their rights is properly thought through .
<sp>
<2en> Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market , so its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious .
<2en> Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market , and to opening up its full potential for businesses , in particular , small and medium-sized enterprises , and consumers .
<2en> It merits attention that the Parliament has , in its various resolutions on this matter , repeatedly acknowledged the benefits an improved contract law framework has on the Internal Market , has further welcomed the idea of a common frame of reference , and has insisted on close involvement of itself and the stakeholders concerned .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - On 1 July 2010 , the Commission presented a Green Paper on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses .
<en> The policy options include soft law options , an opt-in regime called the 28th system , the unlikely approximation of substantive national law ( because of resistance by the Council and the impossibility of overnight merging of national legal traditions ) and the option of creating a fully fledged European civil code .
<en> I totally support the report , especially in the context of human rights violations in the Latvian Republic .
<en> I voted in favour .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> This report refers to extremely important issues regarding the rating sector , including the lack of competition , the oligopolistic structure and a lack of accountability and transparency , especially in the rating of government debt .
<2en> In my opinion , it is therefore essential to take steps to create a European Credit Rating Agency , which could work towards a new model of credit rating and create the conditions for developing genuine competitiveness .
<sp>
<2en> It would be a good thing if credit rating agencies were to be more accountable in future .
<2en> The truth is that the agencies gave the highest possible rating to many complex financial instruments , toxic instruments , as we were later to learn .
<2en> The report recommends that there should be more and better risk analysis by market players so that they do not have to rely too much on the credit rating agencies .
<sp>
<2en> Almost the entire market for credit ratings , which are sometimes made compulsory for regulatory purposes , is controlled by three large US agencies .
<2en> Opening up this industry to competition , or creating a European public agency , will not change the perversity of the system .
<2en> It is now madder than ever .
<2en> No one knows which market or which agency directs the reactions of the other ; whether one country 's poor rating triggers panic over sovereign debt , or whether cynical speculation leads to a poor rating ; whether a good rating has an impact on certain assets being held onto or whether , because they are good and one wants to hold onto them , the assets are rated favourably .
<2en> Monitoring the activity of agencies more closely offers only a minimum service and obviously does not go far enough .
<2en> Despite the repeated criticisms they have received in Europe and the US , the reputation of agencies has not really suffered .
<2en> There is no doubt that holding them legally and even financially accountable for the consequences of their mistakes and their irresponsible evaluations would have an impact .
<2en> Yet again , nothing will be resolved without fundamentally changing the system instead of trying to patch it up to guarantee its survival .
<sp>
<2en> By approving Mr Klinz 's report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies , Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets .
<2en> It is important to overcome the current problems that characterise the sector : the lack of competition , the regulatory over-dependence on ratings , and the low reliability of notes .
<2en> In this vein , Parliament 's request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant .
<2en> Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies ( CRAs ) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers , it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process , which will be completed in the autumn .
<sp>
<2en> I welcomed this document because the credit rating industry has various problems , the most serious of which are oligopolistic structures and the lack of competition , accountability and transparency .
<2en> For the dominant credit rating agencies ( CRAs ) in particular , the payment model is a problem , while the regulatory system 's key problem is over-reliance on external credit ratings .
<2en> As you know , CRAs rate three different sectors - the public sector , companies and structured finance instruments .
<2en> There is an inherent conflict of interest if market participants devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory capital requirements .
<2en> I see the need to increase supervisors ' responsibilities , capacity , powers and resources for monitoring , assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models and for imposing prudential measures .
<2en> I believe that credit ratings must serve the purpose of increasing information to the market in a manner that provides investors with a consistent assessment of credit risk across sectors and countries , and consider it important to enable users to better scrutinise CRAs .
<2en> In this respect , it is necessary to highlight the central role of increased transparency in their activities .
<2en> I firmly believe that we must support the establishment of new CRAs while avoiding any distortions of competition .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> The Europe 2020 strategy should provide for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
<2en> A results-based approach is also essential in relation to learning .
<2en> ' Lifelong learning ' is an absolute priority for our citizens , which is why access to vocational education and training must be a priority for us .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting for this report .
<2en> It assesses the financing instrument for development cooperation ( DCI ) , but I note the importance of the mechanism that should succeed it this year .
<2en> I agree with the rapporteur 's criticisms of the fact that the scrutiny work carried out by Parliament was not acknowledged by the representatives of the Member States or the DCI Committee .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this Regulation ( EC ) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation : lessons learned and perspectives for the future .
<2en> 2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation ( EC ) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation ( DCI ) .
<2en> Further simplification and adaptation to new challenges , such as climate change , as well as determining the external dimension of the EU 's internal policies , are important aspects that must be taken into consideration .
<2en> I agree with the provision set out in the resolution that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms .
<2en> The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0.7 % of its Gross National Income ( GNI ) on Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) by 2015 .
<2en> The current level of European aid will have to increase significantly to achieve this aim .
<2en> Coordination and division of labour must be the guiding principles of programming under the new development instrument .
<2en> The idea of European strategy documents should be pursued as a matter of high priority , and the European Parliament must be actively involved in this process .
<2en> Parliament must have the opportunity to defend the specificity of the EU 's development policy in the post-2013 development cooperation instrument by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council .
<sp>
<2en> The Development Cooperation Instrument ( DCI ) is one of the European Union 's extremely altruistic projects , intended to provide assistance to developing countries without any conditions or ulterior interests .
<2en> The lack of any utilitarian aspect to the EU 's involvement must force its institutions to target these funds much better and focus on eradicating poverty and complying with the Millennium Development Goals ( MDG ) .
<2en> I must stress the need for greater transparency for all funds earmarked for this purpose and , more importantly , for increasing the assessments of the impact which the DCI has among the population in those countries .
<2en> This is because these funds must be backed up by effective social policies implemented in developing countries .
<2en> These funds must be , in the medium and long term , the ' rod ' which the relevant peoples will use to learn to ' fish ' and successfully become self-sufficient .
<2en> We must not forget that 2010 was the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
<2en> This is precisely why the Development Cooperation Instrument must continue this fight in developing countries as well , by making a significant contribution to guaranteeing a decent living for as many citizens as possible .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - The purpose of this report on the establishment of a financial instrument for development cooperation is to set at an early stage a Parliament position on this topic .
<en> This position should be based on the lessons drawn from its scrutiny of the implementation of our development cooperation .
<en> I appreciated the method followed by the rapporteur in evaluating the outcome and modalities of the EU cooperation for development .
<en> The rapporteur clearly states that , in spite of the constructiveness of the dialogue with the Commission , the Commission itself did not change its behaviour in development matters as Parliament recommended .
<en> Parliament 's position was only sporadically reflected in the draft implementing measures submitted by the Commission to the DCI management committee .
<en> This is partially understandable .
<en> The main partner of the rapporteur was DG RELEX , whose main mandate is the promotion of EU interests in the rest of the world .
<en> But development cooperation is the one policy area of external action ( besides humanitarian aid ) which is not designed to serve EU interests , but to defend the interests of the most vulnerable populations of this planet .
<en> Since the position expressed in this report fully reflects this global inspiration , I was glad to vote in favour of it .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău 's report as Canada should be seen as a priority partner for agreements of this kind , given that both Europe and Canada have world-leading aircraft manufacturers .
<2en> This Agreement will enable duplication of procedures to be kept to a minimum and mutual certification to be accepted : consequently , the financial savings and simplification of bureaucratic procedures will be of significance and have very positive repercussions for our businesses .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this report , because I believe that a bilateral Agreement on civil aviation safety between the EU and Canada , which is its aim , will bring benefits for Europeans by facilitating trade between both parties .
<en> The objective of the Agreement is to minimise the duplication of assessments , tests and controls and to enable both the EU and Canada to rely on each other 's aeronautical product certification systems .
<en> By approximating the two sets of requirements and regulatory processes , the importing authority will be able to issue its own certificate on the aeronautical product , part or appliance without duplicating all the assessments done by the exporting authority .
<en> European and Canadian companies will save millions of euros a year thanks to shorter , simpler , and hence less costly , product-approval procedures .
<en> Airlines will also benefit , and the Canadian and European aviation markets will become even safer .
<sp>
<2en> The mutual acceptance of certification findings will ensure shorter and simpler , hence less costly , product-approval procedures , while it will also bring huge economic benefits for both European and Canadian companies .
<2en> I am voting for this Agreement as I believe that , besides the economic benefits it brings , it will also establish mutual acceptance of certification findings in all areas of airworthiness for all Member States .
<2en> It is therefore based on mutual trust of the systems in force , whether in the EU or in Canada , and provides for obligations and methods of cooperation so that the importing authority can issue its own certificate on the aeronautical product , part or appliance without duplicating all the assessments done by the exporting authority .
<2en> Airlines will also benefit from the Agreement , since it provides for the use of each other 's approved repair and maintenance facilities .
<2en> It thus represents a massive step forward for markets that are more competitive but also safer , since greater rapprochement and cooperation in matters of certification , inspections and enforcement should enable the parties to ensure a higher level of security for passengers and cargo flights .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău 's report , which gives the European Parliament 's green light for applying an Agreement between the European Community and Canada on civil aviation safety .
<2en> This Agreement will bring the mutual recognition of certification systems for an aeronautical product , part or appliance in terms of airworthiness and maintenance .
<2en> This should save companies whose products have been certified in one country having to go through the whole certification process in another .
<2en> This simplification is good news for a market that is worth close to EUR 50 billion in trade between the two regions .
<sp>
<2en> I voted in favour of this recommendation because I approve of the conclusion of an agreement which , on the one hand , will benefit European and Canadian companies and airlines by saving millions of euro , thanks to shorter and simpler certification procedures , and , on the other hand , will ensure a higher level of security for passengers .
<chp>
<sp>
<2en> Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes that the EU ' shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic , social and territorial cohesion ' , and it has therefore set Union funds for the 2007-2013 period at EUR 347 billion , which corresponds to 35.7 % of the overall EU budget .
<2en> I am voting in favour of this report as it sets out an accurate analysis of the current state of Union funds by demonstrating the areas in which , up until now , EUR 93.4 million has been spent , suggests recommendations and areas for improvement , contributes to resolving the economic and financial crisis , and promotes best practices and mutual learning at regional level .
<2en> I would like to highlight the fact that the implementation of EU funds varies between the different Member States , and it is important for the EU to understand the difficulties that some countries have had in taking corrective action in order to actively contribute to the wider uptake of EU funds , in line with the Europe 2020 strategy .
<2en> Finally , I would also like to congratulate the Member States on their efforts in putting together the first national strategy report , actively contributing to greater transparency , flexibility , effectiveness and accountability for cohesion policy funds .

<en> in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for the report on the implementation of the cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 as cohesion policy is vital to achieving the Europe 2020 objectives , especially in the areas of employment and social matters .
<en> I deplore the delays that there have been in the selection process for projects in strategic areas such as transport , certain energy and environmental investments , the digital economy , social inclusion , governance and reinforcement of administrative capacities .
<en> Effective selection and implementation of projects in some areas are hampered by missing relevant preconditions such as simpler application procedures at national level , clear national priorities for certain areas of intervention , prompt transposition of EU laws , consolidated institutional and administrative capacities and excessive domestic red tape .
<en> I think that establishing a European intermodal transport system , based on the TEN-T network and interconnecting it with national road , rail and inland waterway projects , is vital to ensuring territorial , economic and social cohesion .
<en> I regret the inadequate investment in projects promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy resources for housing and for housing projects aimed at marginalised communities .
<en> In future , Europe must make considerable investment in innovation , education and new technologies .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( DE ) The strategic report on the implementation of the operational programmes cofinanced under the auspices of cohesion policy is a new instrument that will be essential for transparency and that will help the public understand this complex issue in the future .
<en> Every year the Court of Auditors uncovers enormous irregularities in the distribution of subsidies .
<en> If used correctly , this instrument could play a significant role in helping to stop this .
<en> For this reason , I am in favour of the improvements suggested by the rapporteur , particularly those that relate to the quality of the reports produced by the Member States , ensuring effective controls in the future .
<sp>
<2en> I am voting for this report , as it examines the needs of urban areas , focusing mainly on two aspects : basic infrastructure , and smart investment in infrastructures and services based on technological advances .
<2en> I also agree with the call for attention to be given to strategic planning principles , and with the need for cross-financing that is more flexible between the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) and the European Social Fund ( ESF ) .
<sp>
<2en> European urban diversity must be supported primarily by a flexible mechanism for implementing cohesion policy and by coordinating and adapting urban development projects according to the development needs and strategic guidelines of each city individually .
<2en> There is talk about smart urban development and about the need for cities to improve and modernise their infrastructure and the services they offer .
<2en> To ensure that this is not an idle notion , I think that we must put our trust in the local authorities and elected representatives of those cities .
<2en> We should listen to what communities want , initiate any construction based on their list of priorities and have the belief that mayors know best what are or should be the priorities for their cities .
<2en> This is precisely why I firmly believe , along with the rapporteur , that the offer of EU funding must meet local demand and the integrated strategic planning principles at EU level .
<2en> Therefore , the European Urban Agenda must help reduce disparities in the strategic areas which every modern European city needs , namely , infrastructure , research and innovation , transport , environment , education , health and culture .
<2en> This is because adopting an integrated approach to cohesion policy is the only way in which we will help today 's cities develop in an organic , sustainable and environmentally responsible manner .

<en> in writing . - ( SK ) The global economic and financial crisis sharply reversed the favourable economic and financial conditions prevailing up to 2007 , and again emphasised the fact that proper use was not made of the unforeseen profits that were accumulated in the favourable period to create an opportunity for effective procedures in the unfavourable period .
<en> The availability of fiscal data is essential to the proper functioning of EU budgetary surveillance .
<en> Timely and reliable fiscal data are essential for proper and well-timed monitoring , making it possible to adopt prompt measures in case of an unfavourable budgetary situation .
<en> Transparency is a fundamental element in ensuring the quality of fiscal data , and must include the regular availability of such data .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( EL ) The New Democracy group of MEPs voted today in favour of the six proposals in the new economic governance package .
<en> The European Parliament 's proposals pave the way for an environment of economic stability , while at the same time allowing for the development of innovative action mechanisms , such as Eurobonds and European project bonds .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - ( LT ) I welcomed this document , because the economic governance package is aimed at responding to the need for greater coordination and closer surveillance of economic policies in the economic and monetary union .
<en> Furthermore , requirements are proposed for the budgetary frameworks of the Member States to encourage fiscal responsibility by setting minimum requirements for national fiscal frameworks and ensuring that they are in line with Treaty obligations .
<en> To back up the changes in the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact , the Commission also proposed strengthening the enforcement mechanisms for the euro area Member States .
<en> In general , I welcome the proposals put forward to ensure improvements in national fiscal frameworks and to encourage Member States to make better fiscal decisions in the future .
<en> In particular , proposals for improved statistical reporting of fiscal data are required in order to avoid a repeat of recent experiences in some Member States .
<en> Likewise , proposals for independent budgetary offices , national fiscal rules , and mandatory multi-year budgeting should also help provide greater fiscal stability .
<sp>
<en> in writing . - I voted against this report as I strongly oppose the programme of crippling austerity measures which is being driven through the European Union by the centre-right .
<en> This package of economic governance reforms will stifle growth in the EU at the very time we need investment for growth , for research and development and for jobs , to secure the economic future of Europe .
<en> This financial reform package will hit the poorest in Europe the hardest , while leaving the cause of the crisis - the financial sector - untouched .
<en> I welcome improved coordination of economic and fiscal policy in Europe , but strongly oppose the short-term vision under which this is being imposed .
<en> Long-term investment in the green economy , in scientific research and in infrastructure is absolutely crucial to economic stability , job creation and growth , and I cannot support this package of reforms which seeks crippling austerity across Europe .
<sp>
<2en> The Commission proposes to reinforce Member States ' compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact , deepen fiscal policy coordination , set minimum requirements for fiscal frameworks and specify the mechanisms for enforcing the current rules .
<2en> We welcome the proposal put forward to ensure improvements in national fiscal frameworks and to encourage Member States to make better fiscal decisions in the future .
<2en> Likewise , we support the establishment of independent budgetary offices , national fiscal rules and mandatory multi-year budgeting to provide greater economic and monetary stability .
<2en> We believe that the requirements for national budgetary frameworks should not only ensure that fiscal planning of Member States is based on realistic forecasts , but should also ensure that appropriate attention is given to the sustainability of their respective social protection systems , including pension and health care systems .
<2en> Lastly , we believe that the requirements for national budgetary frameworks should be designed in such a way as to encourage Member States and leave them room for manoeuvre for development-oriented public investments , such as in education and training , contributing to the achievement of the EU 's growth and employment objectives .
