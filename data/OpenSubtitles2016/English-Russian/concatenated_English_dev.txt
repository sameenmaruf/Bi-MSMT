<en> Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary bioIogicaI ... or shall we say " chemical , " process .
<en> A Iot of nonsense is talked and written about it .
<sp>
<2en> I see .
<2en> What do you use instead ?
<sp>
<en> I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all .
<sp>
<2en> What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you ?
<sp>
<en> You don 't have to do a thing .
<en> chemically , we are already quite sympathetic .
<d>
<sp>
<en> What kind of insurance could he have ?
<sp>
<2en> Enough to cover doctors and hospital bills .
<2en> Say $ 125 a week cash benefit . And he 'd rate around $ 50,000 capital sum .
<sp>
<en> - Capital sum ?
<en> What 's that ? - In case he gets killed .
<sp>
<2en> Maybe I shouldn 't have said that .
<sp>
<en> I suppose you have to think of everything in your business .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Who do you suspect ?
<sp>
<2en> Maybe I like to make things easy for myself .
<2en> But I always tend to suspect the beneficiary . - You mean the wife ?
<2en> - Yeah .
<2en> That wide-eyed dame that just didn 't know anything about anything .
<sp>
<en> You 're crazy , Keyes .
<en> She wasn 't even on the train .
<sp>
<2en> I know she wasn 't , Walter .
<2en> I don 't claim to know how it was worked , or who worked it ... but all I know is that it was worked .
<2en> I 've got to get to a drugstore . This thing feels like a hunk of concrete inside me .
<2en> - Good night , Walter .
<2en> - See you at the office in the morning .
<2en> I 'd like to move in on her right now , tonight .
<2en> If it wasn 't for Norton and his striped-pants ideas about company policy ...
<2en> I 'd have the police after her so fast it 'd make her head spin .
<2en> They 'd put her through the wringer ... and , brother , the things they would squeeze out .
<sp>
<en> Only you haven 't got a single thing to go on , Keyes .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , not too much .
<2en> Just 26 years experience ... all the percentage there is , and this hunk of concrete in my stomach .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - You afraid , baby ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes , I 'm afraid .
<2en> But not of Keyes .
<2en> I 'm afraid of us .
<2en> We 're not the same anymore .
<2en> We did it so we could be together , but instead of that it 's pulling us apart .
<2en> - Isn 't it , Walter ?
<sp>
<en> - What are you talking about ?
<sp>
<2en> And you don 't really care whether we see each other or not .
<sp>
<en> Shut up , baby .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Come here .
<sp>
<2en> I 'd like to see your friend 's face when we tell him .
<2en> He doesn 't sound like much of a detective .
<sp>
<en> Oh , don 't be too hard on him .
<en> He 's a steady worker .
<en> I sure wish he 'd show up .
<sp>
<2en> Don 't rush him .
<2en> We have all night .

<en> We have all what ?
<sp>
<2en> Night .

<en> Hold on , Mark .
<en> I 've got a question for you .
<en> Which magazine sells the most copies ?
<sp>
<2en> Those with girls on the front covers ... and no front covers on the girls .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I 'd rather you don 't have the chance .
<en> I mean it , Mark .
<en> And if you don 't listen to me , one of us will move from this house .
<en> It would be a pity , because we 'll never find a cheaper place .
<sp>
<2en> You 'll never have to move because of me .
<2en> l ... I promise .
<sp>
<en> Good boy .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Where could he have gone ?
<sp>
<2en> Maybe he got some definite lead .
<2en> - Maybe he went right on . - Without calling me ? - In a hurry .
<sp>
<en> - Sam , he called ... when he had nothing but a dissatisfied feeling .
<en> Don 't you think he 'd have called if he had anything at all ?
<sp>
<2en> Yes , I think he would 've .
<2en> - Let 's go see Al Chambers .
<sp>
<en> - Who 's he ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Mrs Bates poisoned this guy she was ... involved with ... when she found out he was married ... then took a helpin ' of the same stuff herself . Strychnine .
<en> Ugly way to die .
<sp>
<2en> Norman found them dead together .
<2en> In bed .
<sp>
<en> You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn 't Bates ' mother ? Now , wait a minute , Sam .
<sp>
<2en> Are you sure you saw an old woman ?
<sp>
<en> Yes ! In the house behind the motel !
<en> I called and pounded but she just ignored me !
<sp>
<2en> You saw Norman Bates ' mother ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> I saw one of them .
<sp>
<2en> What 's she talking about now ?
<sp>
<en> - Well , I only saw a print . Print ?
<sp>
<2en> What sort of print paws , hooves , what ?
<sp>
<en> To tell you the truth , I thought it was made by a fur boot , No , Ian , I 'm sure it wasn 't human .
<sp>
<2en> And if it were , that means there 's shelter nearby .
<2en> Look .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I have never thought of that .
<sp>
<2en> John ?
<sp>
<en> But he will DIE !
<sp>
<2en> The noise !
<2en> I beg of you !
<sp>

<d>
<sp>
<en> What about him ?
<sp>
<2en> He can come with us .
<2en> That way , we can keep an eye on him .
<sp>
<en> Come on then .
<sp>
<2en> Oh dear .
<sp>
<en> What are you waiting for ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , are you going to let me into the TARDIS or not ?
<sp>
<en> I couldn 't , even if I wanted to .
<en> The Doctor 's the only one with a key .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Come now , Doctor .
<en> Surely you don 't think that I was going to help the Daleks ?
<sp>
<2en> I did .
<sp>
<en> Now Doctor , look , let 's talk this over like civilised time-travellers .
<en> It 's the Taranium core they want , not you .
<en> Why don 't you give it to them .
<en> Then we can be all on our way .
<sp>
<2en> If you believe that , my friend , you will believe anything !
<sp>
<en> Doctor , don 't do anything you might regret .
<en> Doctor ?
<en> DOCTOR !
<sp>
<2en> Give your report .
<sp>
<en> The time-traveller has not made contact .
<sp>
<2en> He has betrayed us .
<2en> Prepare a task force to attack .
<2en> All the humans will be exterminated .
<sp>
<en> I obey .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Now if this was an atomic-laser , it might be more use !
<sp>
<2en> An atomic-laser ?
<2en> Is that better than an axe ?
<sp>
<en> Look at the damage you 've done - completely senseless !
<sp>
<2en> Look what they did to our friends Father !
<sp>
<en> Destroying the machines won 't avenge Abu ... or help Vana , will it ?
<sp>
<2en> But we can 't get in there !
<2en> If we attack their machines ...
<sp>
<en> The Krotons will come out !
<sp>
<2en> I think something 's coming out now !
<sp>
<en> Doctor , what is it ?
<sp>
<2en> I don 't know Zoe , but keep well clear of it !
<sp>
<en> Look out !
<sp>
<2en> What 's it doing ?
<sp>
<en> It seems to be looking at us .
<sp>
<2en> Well how can it , it 's not alive ... is it ?
<sp>
<en> Doctor it 's after you !
<d>
<sp>
<en> Zip me up , will ya , Tex ?
<en> Morey 's always complaining about his ulcers .
<sp>
<2en> I don 't know what line Morey 's in ... but myself , now , I 'm kind of a hustler .
<2en> Pardon me , ma 'am .
<sp>
<en> I said , ' A person 's gotta make a living .
<sp>
<2en> Are you sure you heard what I said ? Sorry , Tex .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Excuse me , sir .
<en> The medics are on their way over .
<sp>
<2en> They 'd better not touch the body for a while .
<2en> - It 's radiating a good deal of heat .
<sp>
<en> - Right , sir .
<en> - The man 's dead , Doctor .
<sp>
<2en> - Heat , Brigadier .
<2en> Like the wrench that killed that technician .
<2en> Like that switch over there .
<2en> - What about these two ?
<2en> - There don 't seem to be any major injuries .
<2en> Shock ?
<2en> Possibly .
<2en> I don 't know .
<2en> Wyatt ?
<2en> Private Wyatt ?
<2en> Doctor , I need some answers .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You 're taking a great deal of interest in this prisoner , Director .
<sp>
<2en> - For security ...
<2en> - Security is my responsibility .
<2en> Since you allowed the man to enter the complex and roam about ...
<2en> The man was caught !
<2en> He is no longer a danger to us .
<2en> The people who sent him , how and why he came here , this information is vital .
<2en> Then you 'd better get him to talk and do it quick .
<2en> Before the day is over , I want him liquidated .
<sp>
<en> If it decreases , let me know at once .
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> Dr Williams , I think we should have checked the whole system from top to bottom while we had the drill at minimum revs .
<sp>
<en> Director Stahlman knows what he 's doing .
<sp>
<2en> You all make a little tin god of that Stahlman .
<2en> - Well , I think he 's a nut .
<sp>
<en> - That sort of remark 's dangerous .
<sp>
<2en> I tell you , Stahlman 's a nut .
<2en> Well , aren 't you going to report me ?
<2en> Get me a week in the punishment cells ?
<2en> Things are looking up .
<2en> A couple of days ago , you 'd have reported me without a second thought .
<sp>
<en> Please , don 't push .
<en> I 'll have you know that your counterpart in the other world is a nice sociable sort of chap , Sergeant .
<en> - My rank is Platoon Under Leader .
<en> - That 's a bit of a mouthful .
<en> Your trouble is you talk too much .
<en> Ah , I see I 've got company .
<en> - And what did he do ?
<en> Park in a restricted zone ?
<en> - Stop asking stupid questions .
<en> At least he seems to be sleeping peacefully .
<en> He 's had a tranquilliser dart .
<en> They don 't give us any trouble after that .
<en> We should have done the same to you .
<en> Now get in .
<en> What about some food ?
<en> A cup of tea ?
<en> Some cocoa ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> - We 've got to stop him at once .
<en> - Not so easy .
<en> He 's arrested all my men and moved in his own troops .
<en> - We 've got to get in there somehow .
<sp>
<2en> - Why don 't you use them ?
<sp>
<en> You know , I think he 's right .
<sp>
<2en> You won 't forget I thought of it ?
<2en> Get him out of here .
<sp>
<en> We 're going to return you to your own people .
<en> But first we need your help to prevent a catastrophe .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Jo !
<en> Jo !
<sp>
<2en> Please !
<2en> Turn that machine off - or they 'll kill all of us !
<2en> Please !
<sp>
<en> Sir ?
<sp>
<2en> Yes ?
<sp>
<en> We 've picked up that time transmitter again .
<sp>
<2en> You 're sure ?
<sp>
<en> Yes , sir .
<en> Same frequency , same time ... time zone .
<en> Much stronger now .
<sp>
<2en> Right .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Krasis , the high priest will assist me .
<en> Prepare , Krasis .
<sp>
<2en> And what happened to the rest of the council ?
<sp>
<en> Yes , where are they ?
<sp>
<2en> Are they alive ?
<sp>
<en> The point is academic , Doctor .
<en> In a few moments , it 'll be of no further interest to you .
<sp>
<2en> Then satisfy my curiosity now .
<2en> Are they indeed alive , or are they dead like King Dalios ?
<sp>
<en> The King is unharmed !
<sp>
<2en> The King is dead , Madam !
<sp>
<en> It 's true .
<en> We were there when he died this morning .
<sp>
<2en> You were there ?
<2en> You saw him ?
<2en> Is this true ?
<2en> Is this true ?
<2en> Is the lord Dalios , your King , no longer alive ?
<2en> Answer me !
<sp>
<en> He died this morning .
<en> He was an old man .
<sp>
<2en> And you were responsible for his death !
<sp>
<en> Quiet !
<sp>
<2en> You promised .
<sp>
<en> I promised you power .
<en> And you shall have it .
<en> Power to realise your most ambitious dreams !
<sp>
<2en> You promised he should not be harmed !
<sp>
<en> He was an old man - and he was stubborn !
<sp>
<2en> Oh , you !
<2en> Seize him !
<2en> Seize him !
<sp>
<en> Krasis , the switch !
<sp>
<2en> No , stop him !
<2en> Stop him !
<sp>
<en> Kronos !
<en> I , the Master , welcome you !
<en> I , the Master , bid you do my will !
<en> I command you - destroy these men !
<en> Obey me !
<en> I command you !
<en> I order you to obey !
<sp>
<2en> He 'll never obey you !
<2en> Don 't you understand yet what you 've done !
<2en> He 's out of control !
<2en> Jo !
<2en> Jo , come back !
<2en> Jo !
<2en> Jo !
<2en> Come back , Jo !
<2en> Come back !
<2en> Jo !
<sp>
<en> There , Miss Grant .
<en> I think we 've seen the last of the Doctor .
<en> Buried for all time under the ruins of Atlantis .
<en> You know , I 'm going to miss him .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Come on , let 's get started !
<sp>
<2en> - No . We wait for Codal .
<sp>
<en> Tell me , what 's the name of this planet ?
<sp>
<2en> Spiridon , one of the nastiest pieces of space garbage in the ninth system .
<sp>
<en> - Is it inhabited ?
<sp>
<2en> - Oh , yes !
<2en> Vegetation that 's more like animal life than plant , creatures hostile to everything , including themselves , and a climate that changes from tropical in the day
<2en> - to sub-freezing in the night .
<sp>
<en> - Any intelligent life form ?
<sp>
<2en> Oh , yes , the Spiridons .
<2en> They 're invisible .
<sp>
<en> Mmm , I 'd very much like to see one of them !
<en> I 'd very much like to come into contact with one of them .
<sp>
<2en> Don 't worry , you will .
<sp>
<en> You said just now that you were on some sort of mission ?
<en> May one ask what it is ?
<sp>
<2en> No , I can 't tell you that , that 's top secret .
<sp>
<en> As you wish .
<en> I 'm on something of a special mission myself .
<sp>
<2en> - Taron , why can 't you face it ?
<sp>
<en> - Now listen ...
<sp>
<2en> None of us is ever going to get away from here !
<2en> - The radio 's gone , the ship 's damaged , we can 't takeoff , we 're on a suicide mission !
<sp>
<en> It was your choice , nobody made you come .
<sp>
<2en> Well , whatever it was you came here to do , it must be pretty important .
<sp>
<en> - We think so .
<sp>
<2en> - How many are there of you ?
<sp>
<en> There were seven .
<en> But our commander was killed on touchdown .
<en> And we 've lost three others since .
<sp>
<2en> - Oh , only three left .
<sp>
<en> - Yeah .
<sp>
<2en> Well , you could make that four if you 'd let me help you .
<2en> - Five with Jo Grant .
<sp>
<en> - Thanks .
<en> I 'll think about it .
<sp>
<2en> - You still don 't trust me ?
<sp>
<en> - Why should I ?
<en> You come here out of nowhere and then claim to be something out of a legend .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , I see your point .
<2en> But I am on your side , you know ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> - I spent 20 years down there .
<en> - Think it scares me now ?
<sp>
<2en> - Why bother ?
<sp>
<en> I 'm going down .
<sp>
<2en> Therefore I think it imperative that nobody should go down the mine .
<2en> - It must be sealed off completely .
<2en> - I disagree , sir .
<2en> I intend to make the investigation of that mine my first priority as soon as the Doctor arrives .
<2en> If he ever does arrive .
<d>
<sp>
<en> We 've done them no harm .
<sp>
<2en> - What other reason ?
<sp>
<en> One problem at a time .
<en> Our problem is to find our way out .
<en> This looks quite promising .
<en> Let 's try it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Don 't touch it .
<en> It 's crawling with germs .
<sp>
<2en> He 's right .
<2en> The thing must be destroyed .
<sp>
<en> Eradicator detachment , one charge , maximum intensity ...
<sp>
<2en> - Wait !
<sp>
<en> - Stand aside , Kalik .
<sp>
<2en> - This procedure is not in order .
<sp>
<en> - Not in order ?
<sp>
<2en> The eradicator cannot be used without authority .
<sp>
<en> - In an emergency ...
<sp>
<2en> - One alien is hardly an emergency .
<sp>
<en> The function of this tribunal is to keep this planet clean .
<en> This creature comes from outside our solar system and is a carrier of contagion .
<en> The creature may be hostile .
<sp>
<2en> Will you stop referring to me as the creature ?
<2en> Or I may become exceedingly hostile .
<sp>
<en> Silence !
<en> The tribunal is deliberating .
<sp>
<2en> The tribunal is not deliberating .
<2en> The tribunal is arguing .
<2en> Quite nonsensically , if I may say so .
<sp>
<en> The tribunal will not tolerate insolence from unauthorised life forms !
<sp>
<2en> Will one of you kindly explain to me where I am ?
<2en> Which planet , I mean .
<sp>
<en> You are on Inter Minor .
<sp>
<2en> Inter Minor ?
<2en> Not Metebelis 3, the blue planet of the Acteon Galaxy ?
<sp>
<en> Oh , no .
<sp>
<2en> I see .
<2en> Thank heavens the Tardis is safe anyway .
<sp>
<en> - This container is yours ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes , it is indeed .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Hold them !
<sp>
<2en> I can 't hold it .
<sp>
<en> You must !
<en> Pull !
<en> Come on .
<en> Put your leg here .
<sp>
<2en> Look !
<sp>
<en> Out of here !
<en> Quick !
<d>
<sp>
<en> You leave me no choice .
<en> You have very powerful friends , Mr Stevens .
<sp>
<2en> I think I can see something .
<sp>
<en> Good . Go on .
<en> Right .
<en> Let me pass .
<en> - A pipe .
<en> I was right .
<sp>
<2en> - Of course .
<sp>
<en> After you , Miss Grant .
<en> Up you go .
<sp>
<2en> - What 's that smell ?
<sp>
<en> - It 's crude oil .
<en> Or rather , crude oil waste .
<en> You can see it on the sides of the pipe .
<sp>
<2en> - You mean it leads to Global Chemicals ?
<sp>
<en> - Where else ?
<en> Come on .
<en> Up you go .
<sp>
<2en> I don 't know what 's happened to you , but you 've got to fight it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Sorry , sir , you faded out there for a little while .
<sp>
<2en> Sorry .
<sp>
<en> What was that you were saying about the bomb ?
<sp>
<2en> Ah ... it seems to me ...
<2en> Sorry , I 've , I 've gone blank .
<2en> Hold it . I 'll have it again in just a minute .
<2en> I forget so many things in here , ... so many things .
<2en> Hold on , just a minute , let me think ...
<sp>
<en> But you can 't explode in the bomb bay .
<en> It 's foolish .
<en> You 'll kill us all .
<en> There 's no reason for it .
<sp>
<2en> I am programmed to detonate in 9 minutes .
<2en> Detonation will occur at the programmed time .
<sp>
<en> Would you consider another course of action ?
<en> For example , just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<sp>
<en> I can tell , that damn thing Just doesn 't understand .
<d>
<sp>
<en> The Tardis isn 't here .
<sp>
<2en> Well , it probably hasn 't arrived yet . We 're a little early .
<sp>
<en> Hasn 't arrived yet ?
<sp>
<2en> No , you see , the Tardis is drifting back through time , Harry .
<2en> We 'll just have to wait for it to turn up . ( CHUCKLES )
<sp>
<en> I say , Doctor , did you want this ring thing ? - What , that ?
<en> - Yes .
<sp>
<2en> - No .
<sp>
<en> - Oh , well , I 'd rather like to have it .
<sp>
<2en> - Well , you take good care of it , Harry .
<sp>
<en> - Of course I will .
<en> You knew that was gonna happen , didn 't you ?
<en> - He 's dead .
<en> Been dead some time . - How long ?
<en> A week or two , I 'd say .
<en> There 's very little sign of putrefaction though .
<sp>
<2en> Sterile atmosphere .
<sp>
<en> Yes , exactly , and no sign of injury .
<en> Nothing to indicate the cause of death .
<sp>
<2en> Well , he was just sitting against the door as though he 'd collapsed .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - That was a very impressive speech , Doctor .
<sp>
<2en> - Yes , it was meant to be .
<sp>
<en> Let 's hope it 's convinced them .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , let 's hope so , Harry .
<2en> Sometimes words aren 't enough .
<sp>
<en> Well , they seem to have reached a decision .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm afraid , Doctor , the councillors could not agree to halt all experimentation at the bunker .
<sp>
<en> - The councillors are fools .
<sp>
<2en> - Let me finish , please .
<2en> It has been agreed that an independent tribunal will investigate all work that is being done at the bunker .
<sp>
<en> But that could take months .
<en> Davros already has several prototype Daleks ready for action .
<sp>
<2en> It has also been agreed that , pending the investigation , Davros ' experiments will be suspended .
<sp>
<en> It is less than I 'd hoped for .
<sp>
<2en> And I promise you , Doctor , if your allegations are borne out ,
<2en> - all work at the bunker will be closed down .
<sp>
<en> - Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> And now I must go with my committee and inform Davros of our decision .
<sp>
<en> I think it 's high time we looked for Sarah , don 't you ?
<sp>
<2en> - The one you left behind in the wastelands ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Just leave now .
<en> Don 't worry about me .
<en> Just go .
<sp>
<2en> Look , sir !
<sp>
<en> No !
<en> No !
<en> Why ?
<en> Why ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Silence !

<en> Yesterday , you were found with the body of one of our scientists .
<en> Last night , one of our guards died and you were seen kneeling over him .
<en> Can you explain this ?
<sp>
<2en> we had nothing to do with those deaths .
<2en> They were brought about by your intrusion .
<2en> Listen , now listen to me , please !

<en> I 'm sorry I can 't remember the exact dates but I hope this card will take care of them all .
<en> I 'm sorry , again , I cannot send you my address like I promised to last year .

<en> I am healthy and well and making lots of money .
<en> I 've been dating a girl for a few months and I know you 'd be proud if you could see her .
<en> Her name is Betsy , but I can tell you no more than that .
<sp>
<2en> Hey , cabbie , you can 't park here .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Well , then tread softly , gentlemen , or I 'll turn you into toads .
<en> That gesture you did .
<en> Yes , that 's the one .
<en> It 's presumably to ward off evil .
<en> It 's interesting because it 's also the sequence for checking the seals on a Starfall Seven spacesuit .
<en> And what makes that particularly interesting is that you don 't know what a Starfall Seven spacesuit is , do you ?
<en> Now , drop your weapons or I 'll kill him with this deadly jelly baby .

<sp>
<en> Obviously a container .
<en> See the lock ?
<sp>
<2en> He is trying to open the Tardis .
<sp>
<en> Pity K9 can 't bark .
<sp>
<2en> Quick ! Quick !
<sp>
<en> - What is it ?
<sp>
<2en> - We must get away .
<sp>
<en> For someone who wanted to commit suicide a few minutes ago , you seem very anxious not to be caught .

<2en> Death is easy .
<2en> Perhaps you 've never been in the Correction Centre , Citizen .
<sp>
<en> Come on , Leela .
<d>
<sp>
<en> We can identify him by his number .
<sp>
<2en> Doctor , those are the clothes the man we saw was wearing !
<sp>
<en> - What do you think of these ?
<sp>
<2en> - Some sort of hair .
<sp>
<en> - Yes , I think they 're rat hairs .
<sp>
<2en> - Rat hairs ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> That would explain the dark side of man 's nature .
<en> But it 's just a theory .
<sp>
<2en> - A pretty wild one .

<sp>
<2en> Now , Jack , as soon as you see it , fire , and we shall run .
<sp>
<en> Look !

<sp>
<2en> Almost there .
<2en> Ah , if you want an alternative explanation , the Fendahl fed into the RNA of certain individuals the instincts and compulsions necessary to recreate .
<2en> These were fed through the generations till they reached Fendelman and people like him .
<sp>
<en> Well , that 's possibly more plausible .
<sp>
<2en> Or on the other hand , it could all be just a coincidence .

<sp>
<en> Let 's hope that we can profit from the misfortunes of those travellers .

<2en> I don 't understand .
<sp>
<en> I mean the planetary survey teams .
<en> That 's where your tribe got its name from .
<en> Sevateem , survey team .
<en> The question is , were you here before them ?

<2en> Are we their captors or their children ?
<sp>
<en> You catch on quickly .
<en> Certainly they never returned to base .
<sp>
<2en> Is the weapon ready ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Gentlemen , gentlemen , gentlemen .
<en> Democracy at work , I see .
<sp>
<2en> What did he say , Doctor ?
<sp>
<en> He said he 's extremely sorry about all the trouble that he 's caused , that he has great power and knowledge and he puts it all at your disposal .
<sp>
<2en> Should we trust him ?
<sp>
<en> He offers you this as a token of his good faith .
<en> Press it , and he 'll cease to exist .
<sp>
<2en> - Another of your miracles ?
<sp>
<en> - Well , there 's one way to find out .
<en> No ?
<en> Little Gentek ?
<en> Good .
<en> You 've got to trust someone sometime .
<sp>
<2en> But we must still choose a leader .
<sp>
<en> But that 's not my problem .
<sp>
<2en> There is no choice to be made . I am the leader of the Sevateem .
<sp>
<en> My people would never accept the leadership of a mindless savage .

<sp>
<en> We have calculated the methane production .

<2en> Tell me , where were your men when they were killed ?
<sp>
<en> - Why do you ask ? - What ?
<sp>
<2en> Oh , I don 't know .
<2en> Just curious .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - It 'll be light in one hour .
<en> So we 'll take a swamp glider and go in force .
<sp>
<2en> - There 's no need for you to be involved .
<sp>
<en> - You heard Mensch .
<en> If they 're sacrificing , they 're preparing for war , and that means that Rohm-Dutt has got through with the guns .
<en> We 've got gas mortars , so we could knock out that settlement in a couple of minutes .
<en> Now that we know they 're armed , we can prove that we were acting in self-defence .
<en> Let 's go .
<en> Not you !
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Hello , Leela .
<sp>
<2en> - Oh , Doctor .
<sp>
<en> Put it away .
<en> Borusa , what are you doing here ?

<2en> Your Excellence .

<en> My induction ?
<sp>
<2en> The Vardans ?
<sp>
<en> - Vardans .
<sp>
<2en> - The Sontarans ?
<2en> Doctor , you saved Gallifrey .
<sp>
<en> I have ?
<en> - Oh , what do you think of that , Leela ?
<sp>
<2en> - I think you 've gone mad .
<sp>
<en> He remembers nothing of it .
<en> It is the wisdom of Rassilon .
<d>
<sp>
<en> That be what we call scringe stone , sir .
<sp>
<2en> Scringe stone .
<2en> Oh , how interesting .
<sp>
<en> You hangs a bit of that around your neck and you won 't never suffer from the scringes no matter how cold it be .

<en> - And that be a proven fact .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Oh , sorry .
<sp>
<2en> No , that 's all right .
<2en> I mean , apart from space warping , which he couldn 't possibly understand , there is a theoretical way of avoiding the time distort .
<sp>
<en> - Is there really ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<2en> Just pass me that screwdriver , will you ?
<2en> Yes , you operate in a different dimension , you see , in another kind of space .
<sp>
<en> - Otherwise , hyperspace . - Yes .
<en> But I still don 't know where Romana and Vivien are .
<sp>
<2en> Listen , they 're still in the circle , or whatever occupies that space in the other dimension .
<sp>
<en> - Oh , I see .
<sp>
<2en> - Good .
<2en> Perhaps you 'll explain it to me sometime when you 've got a few minutes to spare .
<sp>
<en> - Doctor ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes ?
<sp>
<en> May I ask you a personal question ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , I don 't see how I can stop you asking .
<sp>
<en> Are you from outer space ?
<sp>
<2en> - No .
<sp>
<en> - Oh .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm more from what you 'd call " inner time " .
<sp>
<en> - Ah .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Romana ?
<en> Romana ?
<en> All change at Venus for the Brighton line .
<sp>
<2en> Very funny .
<2en> Where have you been ?
<2en> What 's happening ? Where am I ?
<sp>
<en> Well , in strict order of asking , busy , nothing , hyperspace .
<en> Your friend doesn 't look too well .
<en> What happened to you ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , I don 't know exactly .
<2en> All I remember is Vivien Fay coming up behind me and then waking up here .
<2en> What do you mean , hyperspace ?
<2en> - It can 't be .
<sp>
<en> - Why not ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , hyperspace is a theoretical absurdity .
<2en> Everybody knows that .
<sp>
<en> Yes , except , apparently , the people who built this ship 4,000 years ago .
<en> It 's a hyperspace vessel .
<sp>
<2en> - That 's ridiculous .
<sp>
<en> - Come on .
<sp>
<2en> Even granting the hyperspace hypothesis , Doctor , what about deceleration ?
<2en> How do you decelerate an infinite mass ?
<2en> Anyway , where is this ship ?
<2en> Why can 't it be seen from Earth ?
<sp>
<en> There 's your answer .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - What 's your name ?
<sp>
<2en> - Idas .
<sp>
<en> Idas ?

<sp>
<2en> - Hello .
<sp>
<en> Are you frightened ?
<sp>
<2en> These tunnels could stretch for miles .
<2en> P7E must be at the end of one of them , but which one ?
<sp>
<en> - Split up , sir ?
<en> - Two pairs ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<2en> - Herrick ?

<en> You 're early .
<sp>
<2en> - Doctor ?
<sp>
<en> - Yes .
<en> Madame Lamia , is it ?
<sp>
<2en> - We agreed to meet at midnight .
<sp>
<en> Yes , but I had nothing better to do , so I thought I 'd come early .
<en> - What 's your reason ?
<sp>
<2en> - Do I need one ?
<sp>
<en> No , but it would 've been fun to hear it .
<en> - Where 's Romana ?
<sp>
<2en> - You agree to my terms ?
<sp>
<en> I do indeed . Safe conduct for Count Grendel in return for Romana , also safe and sound .
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<sp>
<en> - Where is Romana ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Are you locking us into a laboratory ?
<sp>
<2en> - In here .
<sp>
<en> Oh , I 'd much rather stay out here .
<en> This looks so interesting .
<sp>
<2en> In here I said .
<2en> You may light it if you wish .
<sp>
<en> - How long 's this thing going to last us ?
<sp>
<2en> - Two hours , maybe three .
<sp>
<en> What happens after that ?
<sp>
<2en> After that , you won 't need any light .
<sp>
<en> - What do you think you 're play ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Well done , K9 .
<sp>
<2en> - I 'm sorry , Romana !
<sp>
<en> Now your quest is over .
<en> You have something of , shall we say , interest to me in this machine of yours ?
<sp>
<2en> Oh , you mean the TARDIS .
<2en> Yes , yes , I expected to find that here .
<2en> Correct me if I 'm wrong .
<2en> This is Zeos , isn 't it ?
<sp>
<en> Don 't waste my time .
<sp>
<2en> And we came up in the transmat shaft and then , as they say , everything went black .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Merak !
<en> I 'm here !
<sp>
<2en> You fool !
<2en> Do you think I would leave you on Zeos ?

<2en> You 're not within a million miles of your precious Merak .
<sp>
<en> Not on Zeos ?
<en> Then what is this place ?
<sp>
<2en> This , Princess , is my domain .
<sp>
<en> Shapp !
<en> Where 's Shapp ?

<d>
<sp>
<en> Of course !
<en> Drax .
<sp>
<2en> Yeah .
<2en> I was all right at practical , remember ?
<sp>
<en> - Yeah .
<sp>
<2en> - Temporal theory did me .
<2en> Still , you did well , mind , getting your doctorate and all that .
<sp>
<en> - What happened to you ?
<sp>
<2en> - I failed , didn 't I ?
<2en> Still , not to worry , I was doing all right till this lot .
<2en> I went into repair and maintenance .
<2en> Do anything , anytime , anywhere .
<2en> Been all over the galaxy .
<2en> Buy a bit , do it up , sell it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Yes , of course I 'm listening ... - Because if you 're not listening , I can make you listen , because I can do anything .
<sp>
<2en> As from this moment , there 's no such thing as free will in the entire universe .
<2en> There 's only my will , because I possess the Key to Time !
<sp>
<en> Doctor , are you all right ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , of course I 'm all right .
<2en> But supposing I wasn 't all right ?
<2en> This thing makes me feel in such a way I 'd be very worried if I felt like that about somebody else feeling like this about that .
<2en> Do you understand ? - Yes .
<2en> - What do you understand ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> You saw all this with your own eyes ?
<sp>
<2en> Yes , my lady .
<2en> The Guardmaster is awaiting your orders .
<sp>
<en> Guard , the prisoner must not communicate with the tin animal .
<en> What were you up to ?
<sp>
<2en> I told the guard .
<2en> Checking K9 's circuitry .

<sp>
<2en> The fleet 's beginning to break up .
<2en> Go back and stand by the manual release ... for the landing claw .
<sp>
<en> I really don 't see how that 's going to help .
<en> Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances .
<en> The Empire may be gracious enough ...
<sp>
<2en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> What 's your next move ?
<sp>
<2en> If they follow standard imperial procedure ... they 'll dump their garbage ... before they go to light speed ... and then we just float away .
<sp>
<en> With the rest of the garbage .
<en> Then what ?
<sp>
<2en> Then we got to find a safe port somewhere around here .
<2en> Any ideas ?
<sp>
<en> Where are we ?
<sp>
<2en> The Anoat system .
<sp>
<en> There 's not much there .
<sp>
<2en> No .
<2en> Well , wait .
<2en> This is interesting .
<2en> Lando .
<sp>
<en> Lando system ?
<sp>
<2en> Lando 's not a system .
<2en> He 's a man . Lando Calrissian .
<2en> He 's a cardplayer , gambler , scoundrel . You 'd like him .
<sp>
<en> Thanks .
<sp>
<2en> Bespin .
<2en> It 's pretty far , but I think we can make it .
<sp>
<en> A mining colony ?
<sp>
<2en> Yeah , a tibanna gas mine .
<2en> Lando conned somebody out of it .
<2en> We go back a long way , Lando and me .
<sp>
<en> Can you trust him ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - You went to the marsh ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<sp>
<en> The mists .
<en> How could you breathe ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , an odd smell , I agree .
<2en> But definitely non-toxic .
<sp>
<en> Clearly the witness is lying .
<en> The manuals say the mists are fatal .
<sp>
<2en> - Not necessarily .
<sp>
<en> - Not necessarily ?
<sp>
<2en> As First Decider , I am now keeper of the system files .
<sp>
<en> The truth is known to Nefred .
<en> We must simply accept the inconsistencies .
<sp>
<2en> It is fitting that the citizens believe the mists are dangerous .
<2en> It stops them from straying when Mistfall comes .
<sp>
<en> But if that is so ...
<sp>
<2en> - It is for the good of the community .
<d>
<sp>
<en> We could destroy them now , while they 're sleeping .
<sp>
<2en> They can only be destroyed with a wooden stake .
<sp>
<en> There 's this .
<sp>
<2en> It 's not a wooden stake , Tarak .
<2en> We 're supposed to be looking for Adric , remember ?
<sp>
<en> Your friend ?

<2en> I 'm just wondering if we found him in time .
<sp>
<en> The Record of Rassilon .
<en> Oh , good .
<en> The Record of Rassilon .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I thought there was something funny about that steering , but you wouldn 't listen to me .
<sp>
<2en> Well , the exterior of a Tardis still exists as a real space-time event .
<sp>
<en> But mapped onto one of the interior continua .
<sp>
<2en> Precisely .
<2en> That 's very good .
<sp>
<en> - So you can change it into anything you like .
<sp>
<2en> - Ah , well , that 's a sore point .
<2en> According to the handbook , yeah , because the outer plasmic shell of a Tardis is driven by the chameleon circuit , or so theory runs .
<2en> In practice , however , I always meant to ask Romana to help me to fix it one day .
<2en> Ah . I suppose we 're going to miss Romana .
<sp>
<en> - And K9 , too .
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<2en> Still , the future lies this way .
<d>
<sp>
<en> They 're retiring people .
<en> They like a quiet life .
<en> There 's no telling what a creature like that would do on Logopolis .
<sp>
<2en> So how do we flush him out ?
<sp>
<en> And there 's no saying what that might do to the Tardis systems .
<en> Can you swim ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<sp>
<en> - Good .
<en> Materialise the Tardis underwater and open the door .
<en> That 's the River Thames .
<en> We 'll put down there .
<sp>
<2en> And water sluices in and floods out the whole Tardis .
<sp>
<en> Yes .
<en> Adric , shut down everything .
<en> Fold back the Omega configuration .
<sp>

<sp>
<en> - Okay , don 't listen to him .

<sp>
<2en> That 's Brad .
<2en> I found him at Nordstrom 's .

<2en> I thought a little background music would add a nice touch .
<2en> He knows every song ever written .
<sp>
<en> Free Bird !
<en> Hi Brad .
<sp>
<2en> Lorelai , please .
<d>
<sp>

<en> Come on – speak .
<sp>
<2en> Louise , I got two over here !
<sp>
<en> - So , we 're done , right ?
<sp>
<2en> - You had a good time yesterday .
<sp>
<en> What was yesterday ?
<sp>
<2en> Yesterday was the day that you were all freaked out about the seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin and today 's the day you 're not .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Like what ?
<sp>
<2en> - Like why was he there ?
<sp>
<en> He was just trying to talk to him .
<en> We both know Whitney can be a little overzealous but his heart 's in the right place .
<sp>
<2en> I just don 't think Kyle would do that .
<2en> He doesn 't seem violent .
<sp>
<en> You can tell from knowing him for two days ?
<en> He 's lived in the woods alone for 10 years .
<sp>
<2en> But that makes him odd , not dangerous .
<sp>
<en> Whitney wouldn 't attack anybody .
<sp>
<2en> He strung me up in a field .
<sp>
<en> So that 's what this is about ?
<en> You haven 't forgiven him .
<sp>
<2en> Lana , I just think there 's something else going on here .
<sp>
<en> Yeah , there is .
<en> You 're looking for an excuse to knock Whitney .
<en> You know what he 's going through right now with his dad .
<en> If you don 't like him , just say it .
<en> Don 't pretend to be his friend .
<sp>
<2en> You know , a barn 's no place for shoes like that .
<sp>
<en> Didn 't like them that much anyway .
<en> Bob Rickman , Rickman Industries .
<sp>
<2en> I know who you are .
<sp>
<en> You probably know why I 'm here .
<sp>
<2en> I hear you 're interested in this farm , and you 're a very persuasive fellow .
<2en> I gotta tell you , there 's not a snowball 's chance in hell I 'd consider selling especially not to Rickman Industries .
<sp>
<en> You got a problem with progress ?
<sp>
<2en> I 'm skeptical about anybody who thinks they can solve my problems with money .
<sp>
<en> Why is that ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , because if I was interested in money , I wouldn 't be a farmer , would I ?
<2en> If you 'll excuse me , I got some real work to do .
<2en> - What happened ?
<2en> You all right ?
<sp>
<en> - Oh , I think I twisted my ankle .
<en> I guess you were right about these shoes .
<en> Could you give me a hand ?
<en> Now , are you sure I can 't convince you to change your mind ?
<sp>
<2en> How could you do this without telling me ?
<2en> What happened to " This land is our legacy " ?
<sp>
<en> - What 's going on , guys ?
<sp>
<2en> - Your father sold the farm to Bob Rickman .
<sp>
<en> What ?
<en> How ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> I really messed up .
<en> I need your help .
<sp>
<2en> Your father spoke with Principal Kwan .
<2en> We know what happened .
<sp>
<en> No , Mom , it was an accident .
<en> - Mom , don 't be afraid of me !
<sp>
<2en> - Stay away from her , Eric .
<sp>
<en> What are you doing , Dad ?
<sp>
<2en> I told you that some day , you 'd have to take responsibility for your actions .
<2en> Well , that day has come .
<sp>
<en> - What did you do ?
<sp>
<2en> - Eric , you need help .
<sp>
<en> So you called the police ?
<en> You 're my dad .
<en> You 're supposed to protect me .
<sp>
<2en> I stopped by to see Eric 's parents this morning .
<sp>
<en> - How are they ?
<sp>
<2en> - They 're scared , Clark .
<sp>
<en> Were you ever scared of me ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Yes !
<sp>
<2en> - You all right , Dad ?
<sp>
<en> - Never better .
<sp>
<2en> That 's a really nice thing you 've done for the Fordmans .
<sp>
<en> Thanks , Mr. Kent .
<en> That means a lot coming from you .
<en> I just want you to know , I closed the book on that day at the bridge .
<sp>
<2en> Why 'd you investigate it in the first place ?
<sp>
<en> That day was a miracle .
<en> Haven 't you ever wanted to find out why things like that happen ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<2en> I just accept the fact that they do .
<2en> You don 't need an explanation for everything , Lex .
<sp>
<en> How did he get the Metropolis Sharks to do it ?
<sp>
<2en> When your father owns the team , it 's easier to pull some strings .
<sp>
<en> It 's strange , all this time I never thought Lex even liked Whitney .
<en> And then he goes and arranges all this .
<sp>
<2en> I think Lex feels he 's become part of our lives .
<sp>
<en> I 'd like to believe that .
<en> You asked him , didn 't you ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Naked ?
<sp>
<2en> You 'd be invisible .
<sp>
<en> So , what 's our next move ?
<en> Should we call the police ?
<sp>
<2en> And report an invisible person ?
<2en> We need a viable suspect .
<sp>
<en> Well , who 's got a problem with Lex 's British fling ?
<sp>
<2en> Amy Palmer .
<sp>
<en> Her parents are on the mansion 's house staff .
<sp>
<2en> Amy said she saw Victoria snooping in Lex 's bedroom .
<2en> - She said Victoria didn 't see her .
<sp>
<en> - No wonder .
<en> - Wait .
<en> Didn 't Amy give blood ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Our people don 't have a written language .
<en> I 've seen a symbol here or there on artifacts , but never in a pattern before .
<sp>
<2en> - So you don 't know what they mean ?
<sp>
<en> - He studied ancient languages .
<en> I 'm sure with some time he can decipher the symbols .
<sp>
<2en> If Luthor doesn 't get at them before we do .
<sp>
<en> Mom , maybe you can talk to Mr. Luthor .
<sp>
<2en> - You know Lionel Luthor ?
<sp>
<en> - Know him ? Mom is his executive assistant .
<sp>
<2en> Well , Clark , I 'll do what I can , but it isn 't that easy .
<2en> The situation isn 't that black-and-white .
<2en> That complex will create 1000 desperately needed jobs .
<sp>
<en> And you think that 's more important than these caves ?
<sp>
<2en> So does anyone want coffee with their pie ?
<sp>
<en> You wanna have a look ?
<sp>
<2en> I kind of like seeing them with my own eyes .
<sp>
<en> So these legends , you don 't think that they 're like Venus and Apollo and all the other myths ?
<sp>
<2en> Just because something 's a myth doesn 't make it not true .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You engineered an employee buyout of the Smallville plant .
<en> Now look at you , you 're building an empire of your own without my help .
<en> But your success shouldn 't prevent us from joining forces when a lucrative venture comes along .
<sp>
<2en> Come on , Dad .
<2en> You don 't need me as an investor in some random office park .
<sp>
<en> No , not as an investor , Lex .
<en> I want you as my partner .
<en> Blame it on a brief bout of sentimentality .
<sp>
<2en> Sentimentality is synonymous with vulnerability .
<2en> You taught me that .
<2en> You 're on your own .
<sp>
<en> The pictographs are a lot more detailed up here .
<sp>
<2en> What do they say ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> How 's the lucky fin ?
<sp>
<2en> - Lucky .
<sp>
<en> - Let 's see .
<en> Are you sure you want to go to school this year ? There 's no problem if you don 't .
<en> You can wait 5 or 6 years .
<sp>
<2en> Come on , Dad , it 's time for school .
<sp>
<en> - Forgot to brush .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Dory ! - Come on !
<sp>
<2en> Help ! Help !
<2en> Get us out ! Aah !
<sp>
<en> - Dad , I know what to do !
<sp>
<2en> - Nemo !
<2en> No ! We have to tell all the fish to swim down together !
<2en> - Get out of there now !
<sp>
<en> - I know this will work ! No , I am not gonna lose you again !
<en> There 's no time !
<en> It 's the only way to save Dory !
<en> I can do this .
<sp>
<2en> You 're right .
<2en> I know you can .
<sp>
<en> - Lucky fin !
<sp>
<2en> - Now , go !
<2en> Hurry !
<sp>
<en> Tell all the fish to swim down !
<d>
<sp>
<en> If someone asks , say you have the flu or something .
<sp>
<2en> Thanks .
<sp>
<en> Yeah , well , don 't thank me .

<sp>
<2en> So , Evelyn what is it a beautiful woman like yourself does for fun ?

<d>

<sp>
<2en> Well , what would we be doing ?
<sp>
<en> I 'd take you out for a romantic night .
<en> Some champagne , fancy dinner , feel you up on the carriage ride home .

<sp>
<en> In a carriage .
<d>
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> - Good evening .

<sp>
<en> - Oh , sure , thanks .

<sp>
<2en> So last chance to run , huh ?
<sp>
<en> Excuse me ?
<sp>
<2en> Just ignore her .
<sp>
<en> Of course I said it .
<en> I can 't imagine who would take jackbooted as a compliment .
<en> I will not apologize .
<en> Every time she went to the pantry , I thought she was marching on Poland .
<en> Oh , I see , because I want things a certain way , I 'm unreasonable ?
<en> Why , that is the most absurd ...
<en> I want to see this document .
<en> Fax it to me immediately .
<sp>
<2en> Fax it to me immediately ?
<sp>
<en> She 's part of the electronic age .
<sp>
<2en> Tomorrow morning is completely unacceptable .
<2en> It 's unacceptable because I 'm paying you three hundred dollars an hour .
<2en> So turn that little near-luxury car around , go back to your office , and fax me that libelous scrap of paper .
<sp>
<en> Ask him if he can pick up some ice cream , too .
<d>
<sp>

<sp>
<en> That 's what 's been happening to me .
<en> One second I 'm helpless , and the next , I 'm in overdrive .
<sp>
<2en> Well , we always have wondered about the source of your abilities .
<sp>
<en> Maybe my strength and my speed , all the things I can do , they come from the sun .
<sp>
<2en> It 's like you 're some sort of walking solar battery .
<sp>
<en> According to this , the effects of the solar flare ought to be done by tomorrow night .
<en> Maybe your accidents are gonna stop .
<sp>
<2en> As long as I don 't use my abilities till then , we should be okay ?
<sp>
<en> Hey , Clark .

<en> - Our resident ghostbuster is still on the job .
<sp>
<2en> - Perry White ?
<2en> - I thought he went back to Metropolis .
<sp>
<en> - Evidently , he had a change of heart .

<en> I have Bugsy Malone running through my head , especially the scene where Scott Baio buys Florrie Dugger a hot dog and he offers her mustard with onions or ketchup without .
<en> So I started thinking , what would I like ? Mustard with onions or ketchup without ?
<en> And then suddenly they both started to sound really good .
<en> But I usually get my hot dogs with ketchup and relish and you don 't just walk out on something that has served you so well for so long .
<en> So , three hot dogs it is .
<en> So what do you think happened to Florrie Dugger anyway ?
<sp>

<sp>
<en> This dream just got 10 times brighter .
<sp>
<2en> What do you mean " dream " ? Lois , I 'm sorry to be the one to tell you this , but you 're not dreaming .
<sp>
<en> Clark , if this isn 't a dream , then it 's the worst nightmare I could ever imagine .
<en> Since when did the Kent family farm become a prison ? And why would you give away the one thing of your dad 's that meant so much to you ?
<en> Okay , hold on .
<en> Explain about the wicked witch and the flying freaks .
<en> Have we been invaded by " The Wizard of Oz " ?

<sp>
<en> Clark , before I fought Tess , she went on and on about some Orb ... called it alien technology , said there was life inside of it .
<en> This invasion ...

<2en> Yeah , well , Tess may have helped .
<2en> These aliens have their own leader .

<en> Tess Mercer , the ultimate ecoterrorist .
<sp>
<2en> And what are you ?
<2en> I understand you were seen talking to Clark Kent .
<2en> It was only a matter of time before the resistance got to him .
<sp>
<en> The only thing I 'm resisting is the urge to kick both your asses .
<en> And if Clark were here right now , he would back me up .
<sp>
<2en> The only reason Clark is still alive is because I 'd hoped he 'd join us to bridge the gap between our people .
<sp>
<en> Trust me , Zod . No one has worked as hard as I have to get Clark to see the good that we 're doing .
<en> But I think we 've fooled ourselves long enough .
<en> He won 't come around .
<sp>
<2en> Which is why neither of you is any good to me alive .

<d>
<sp>
<en> I 'm ... looking , believe me .
<en> I just don 't understand how Crowley could 've tricked me .
<sp>
<2en> Well , he 's a tricky son of a bitch , that 's how .
<2en> Doesn 't matter .
<2en> But if he is up and kicking , then what does matter is finding him , ripping his head off , and shoving it up his ass .
<sp>
<en> What about you ?
<en> Have you found anything ?
<sp>
<2en> No , nothing yet .
<sp>
<en> Where 's Sam ?
<sp>
<2en> He 's keeping busy .
<2en> He 's tracking a Djinn in Omaha as we speak .
<2en> In fact , I 'm heading out there right now to meet up with him .

<2en> Yeah , no , I-I get it .
<2en> No worries .
<2en> But , Cass , you 'll call , right ?
<2en> If you get into real trouble ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Just a few things you may need tonight .
<en> Baby oil , condoms and , uh ... a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology .
<en> They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green MM.
<sp>
<2en> I am not going to have sex with her .
<sp>
<en> Maybe this will overcome your reluctance .
<en> I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming .
<en> Check out those saddle shoes .
<sp>
<2en> Are you insane ?
<2en> I 'm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment .
<sp>
<en> Oh , come on !
<en> Why not ?
<sp>
<2en> Good night ,
<2en> Sheldon . Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse , you might consider , just this once , using your genitalia to actually accomplish something !
<sp>
<en> He still won 't shag the old lady , huh ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<2en> But thank you for asking .
<sp>
<en> Hey .
<en> Hi .
<sp>
<2en> Hello , Leonard .
<2en> I hope you 're hungry .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I don 't think my character should be in a place like this .
<en> Everyone 's undressing her with their eyes .
<en> Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up .
<sp>
<2en> Okay , what exactly are we looking for ?
<2en> Redheaded troll , goes by the name of Glumly .
<2en> According to the message boards , if you want to move stolen goods and it 's after school hours , he 's your guy .
<sp>
<en> Leonard , is this going to take much longer ?
<en> I thought we were going to spend some time together .
<sp>
<2en> Uh , we are .
<2en> In the meantime , you 're welcome to whip up a quick character and join us .
<sp>
<en> Seriously ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , you have to put in a credit card number , but it 's fun .
<sp>
<en> Maybe I should just go home .
<en> Our troll just walked in !
<en> I got him !
<sp>
<2en> We got him .
<2en> We 're almost done .
<d>
<sp>
<en> A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory .
<sp>
<2en> Is it ?
<2en> If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair , could he barge in while you were showering ?
<sp>
<en> Irrelevant .
<en> Leonard doesn 't trim his nose hair .
<en> He thinks because he 's short nobody can see up there .
<sp>
<2en> My point is , Sheldon , the legal principle is , ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it , in this case , Leonard .
<2en> - So much for count one . - But ...
<2en> There 's no buts , Sheldon , that 's how the law works .
<sp>
<en> Schooled !
<sp>
<2en> As for the shower capacity issue , I cite addendum J.
<2en> When Sheldon showers second , any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water .
<2en> I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Must you ?
<sp>
<2en> Sorry , I 'm just trying to cheer my buddy up .
<2en> Rotting Zombie .
<2en> Sheldon 's new Facebook photo .

<en> You did find Klaus , didn 't you ?
<en> He knows where I am now .
<en> Are you taking me to him ?
<en> What is this ?
<sp>
<2en> My parents , your grandparents , they put it here when it became clear that the police weren 't gonna find my body .
<2en> They visit every week , and they bring flowers , even though there 's no one buried here .
<2en> The Isobel they knew is dead .
<d>
<sp>
<en> What 's that ?
<sp>
<2en> That 's the alternator from the truck .
<2en> I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there .
<2en> Yeah , what the hell . Maybe I 'll hook it up to your old Exercycle .
<2en> You gonna leave me ?
<sp>
<en> You flinched when I touched your hand this morning .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm sorry .
<sp>
<en> I was in one of your dreams ?
<sp>
<2en> Yeah .

<sp>
<en> - You have to tell Francis why .
<sp>
<2en> - I can 't .

<sp>
<2en> We cannot fight him .
<2en> All we can do is do what we 've done .

<2en> Now , I can do that as well as anyone .
<2en> You take her far away from here .
<2en> I 'll follow you .
<sp>
<en> No , Elijah .
<en> You can 't .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Then where do we buy matches ?
<en> Look around , Marcel .
<en> We have nothing .
<sp>
<2en> I started with nothing .
<2en> Hell , things didn 't get rolling until I turned you .
<2en> You and your music and the whole city for the taking .
<2en> Those were the days , T.
<2en> Let 's go get them back .
<sp>
<en> And who put you in charge ?
<sp>
<2en> I communed with the ancestors .
<2en> They said it 's time for you to sacrifice yourself .
<sp>
<en> Of course .
<en> It will be an honor to fulfill my duty to our coven .
<en> But it 's not quite my time yet .
<sp>
<2en> The ancestors were very clear .
<2en> We need for you to die so our community can have the full power of the harvest .
<sp>
<en> Careful , Monique .
<en> Not so long ago , I was one of those ancestors .
<en> A spirit forced to watch as little by little , witches surrendered everything to vampires .
<en> We may no longer live under Marcel 's thumb , but I for one don 't particularly enjoy answering to Elijah , either .
<en> Before I take my leave , I 'd like to ensure that you have the power to control your own fate .
<en> The Mikaelsons ' mother Esther was a powerful witch .
<en> Her spellbook contains enchantments that we can use to our own ends .
<en> I can steal it for our coven and we 'll never be held in subjugation again .
<en> You 'll have your sacrifice ...
<en> But I have things to do before I die .
<sp>
<2en> You want us to go to a witch event on bended knee and give them a gift ?
<2en> I 'm sorry , but I just remembered .
<2en> We 're busy doing just about anything else that night .
<sp>
<en> Diego , this isn 't a request .
<en> Your name is on that treaty .
<en> Now , if you have any difficulty whatsoever with your newfound position , I 'd be more than willing to remove you .
<sp>
<2en> I never thought I 'd see the day .
<2en> Vampires bowing down to witches .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Are you wearing a hat ?
<sp>
<2en> It 's hair .
<sp>
<en> No , I think it 's a hat , would you like me to check ?
<sp>
<2en> It 's not real , of course . What is it , then ?
<2en> The government .
<sp>
<en> The government ?
<sp>
<2en> Yeah , up to their usual tricks .
<sp>
<en> It 's a dinosaur , Alf .
<en> A real dinosaur .
<sp>
<2en> I wouldn 't put it past them .
<sp>
<en> You don 't half talk a lot of rubbish , Alfie .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I need to see the prisoner .
<sp>
<2en> And what is this that you 're bringing ?
<2en> A Bible .
<2en> So she can make peace with her maker before her execution .
<2en> If you 're looking for a weapon , some say there 's none greater than the Scriptures themselves .
<2en> Oh , good .
<2en> More sanctimonious talk from my self-appointed redeemer .
<2en> King Henry 's actions may not have been fair , but it doesn 't change the results .
<2en> You must seek absolution for your sins .
<sp>
<en> You think that is gonna save me ?
<en> If you really cared about my well-being , you 'd have brought some poison like I asked !
<en> Then , at least , I could die with dignity , alone , at my own hand .
<en> You mustn 't say such things .
<en> Suicide is a mortal sin !
<en> You 'd be condemned to the fires of Hell .
<en> Henry intends to make a spectacle of my death , as a final insult to me , and to bring some semblance of validity to his actions .
<en> I won 't grant him the satisfaction , if I have to tear my throat out with my own hands !
<en> And unless you 're prepared to help me in that goal , get out .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Belle !
<sp>
<2en> - Are you okay ?
<2en> When you and Neal disappeared , we feared the worst .
<sp>
<en> We went off to see if we could revive The Dark One .
<sp>
<2en> What happened ?
<sp>
<en> Neal was able to resurrect him at the cost of his own life .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - How 's it going ? - Good .
<sp>
<2en> Sheldon 's out of town , so we can do whatever we want .
<2en> We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn 't like .
<sp>
<en> How is it ?
<sp>
<2en> Disgusting .
<2en> Do not tell him .
<sp>
<en> What do you guys want to do tonight ?
<sp>
<2en> I don 't know . I told Howie if I wasn 't busy , I 'd spend the night at his mom 's .
<sp>
<en> So for God 's sake , think of something .
<d>
<sp>
<en> An eternity of torment , agony , and grief .
<en> And you feel it all .
<sp>
<2en> Stop it , Damon .
<2en> Stop it , stop it .
<2en> You 're getting in my head .
<2en> Don 't do this . Please .
<sp>
<en> You 'll feel it forever .
<sp>
<2en> No !
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Thank you , man .
<sp>
<2en> - Thank you . Have fun tonight .
<2en> - I will try .
<sp>

<2en> Are you kidding ?
<2en> That 's what you always do .
<2en> Think harder .
<sp>
<en> You 're right .
<en> You 're right .
<d>
<sp>
<en> This isn 't funny anymore .
<en> Just say no so we 're done with this .
<en> Will you marry me or not ?
<sp>
<2en> Ooh , interesting .
<2en> Did you just propose to me again ?
<sp>
<en> No .
<sp>
<2en> Really ?
<2en> Because I just heard , " Will you marry me ? "
<2en> That 's two proposals , one day .
<2en> Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter .
<sp>
<en> You know what ?
<en> Fine .
<en> Do whatever you want .
<sp>
<2en> Penny , don 't get upset .
<2en> Here .
<2en> I love you , but , no , I will not marry you .
<sp>
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> Now , about that second proposal .
<d>

<2en> The good kind .
<2en> We 've got a new one .
<2en> Five minutes , tops .
<2en> Best to wait for the good coffee .
<sp>
<en> ~ Where am I ?
<sp>
<2en> ~ Sometimes it 's just the instant , oh ...
<sp>
<en> Where am I ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , big question .
<2en> Try to take that one slowly .
<2en> We have been trying to contact family members , but really there is so much admin ...
<sp>
<en> I wasn 't here , I was ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> ~ Condolences ?

<sp>
<en> Yes .
<en> Yes , there is .
<sp>
<2en> This way then .
<sp>
<en> ~ Are you OK ?
<sp>
<2en> ~ No .
<sp>
<en> Good .
<en> There would be something very wrong if you were .
<sp>
<2en> Bit of fresh air .
<2en> Do you good .
<sp>
<en> ~ Why 's it so cold here ?

<sp>
<en> It was my birthday .
<sp>
<2en> Damon and I spent the entire summer looking for Stefan , and I was trying to put on a good face because Caroline was throwing this party for me , but I was so sad .
<2en> I was two seconds from deciding that I wasn 't gonna go .
<2en> I wasn 't gonna leave the room until Damon walked in to give me my birthday gift .
<sp>
<en> It was a necklace that Stefan had given me .
<sp>
<2en> I 'd lost it , and Damon knew what the necklace meant to me .
<sp>
<en> My necklace .
<en> What it meant about my feelings for Stefan .
<sp>
<2en> Even though he loved me , he gave me the one thing that represented hope for me and his brother .
<2en> I knew how much it hurt him , but he did it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Wow .
<en> Because when she wasn 't talking , she was listening .
<en> She listened for hours and hours and hours , so when the opportunity presented itself for me to come back , she made sure I took it .
<sp>
<2en> What did you talk about ?
<sp>
<en> What do you think ?
<sp>
<2en> I broke up with Liam .
<sp>
<en> Dr. future humanitarian award wasn 't good enough ?
<en> What went wrong ?
<sp>
<2en> What do you think ?
<2en> Look . I 'm at a crossroads right now , where I could go live my life the way I think
<d>
<sp>
<en> She doesn 't know it yet , but she 's gonna help me break his spell .
<en> Your job ...
<en> Keep Kol alive , at least until we learn Rebekah 's whereabouts .
<sp>
<2en> Are you listening to me ?
<sp>
<en> Yeah .
<en> That all sounds fine and good , but listen .
<en> When I was getting the werewolves out , I got bit .
<sp>
<2en> I will get you my blood .
<2en> I will get you out of that house , Marcellus , whatever it takes .
<2en> You are not leaving this bloody house , Marcel .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Save your strength .
<en> In here , I am untouchable .
<en> My magic , my rules .
<en> So make yourselves at home .
<en> We 're gonna be here for a while .
<sp>
<2en> Well , that 's the last of them .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I want to tell you a story about a beautiful baby girl .
<sp>
<2en> Elijah will remain here with you .
<2en> He 's been experiencing some side effects since his ordeal as our mother 's captive .
<sp>
<en> I curse you to this body , a meaningless , lonely death .
<sp>
<2en> - You know who I am .
<sp>
<en> - Freya .
<sp>
<2en> Tell our brothers I 'll be coming to see them soon .
<sp>
<en> How does it feel , hunger so intense , like shards of glass creeping through your veins ?
<en> How , exactly , did baby die ?
<en> She 's still alive .
<en> You and your vampires are gonna help me find her .
<en> Who are you ?
<sp>
<2en> I was wondering if you 'd recognize me .
<2en> Then again , you look a bit different yourself .
<sp>
<en> I 'm gonna ask you again before I ask much less nicely .
<en> Who are you ?
<sp>
<2en> Fitting I find you up here .
<d>
<sp>
<en> She will kill anyone who would defy her .
<sp>
<2en> And yet you would defy her .
<sp>
<en> I don 't have a choice .
<en> She will never let me be free .
<en> My one chance is to align with you and kill her .
<sp>
<2en> Well , now that we 're all suitably motivated , let 's talk specifics .
<sp>
<en> For you to understand , I need to start from the beginning .
<en> After taking me from my family ,
<en> Dahlia used me to forge a new brand of connective magic , one that augmented my power , even as it allowed her to draw from me .
<d>
<sp>
<en> The chief of a nearby village threatened to run us off , accusing Dahlia of witchcraft .
<en> She decided to make an example out of the entire encampment ...
<en> Men , women , children .
<en> She killed them all with a wave of her hand .
<en> That was my first inkling of the power that Dahlia had .
<en> Over the course of a thousand years , she 's only grown stronger , and she will bring all her power to bear against you when she comes for your child .
<en> Excuse me .
<sp>
<2en> Rebekah , how are you feeling ?
<sp>
<en> As if I walked straight into a brick wall .
<en> Any luck with Freya ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> That doesn 't count .
<en> I was distracted .
<sp>
<2en> You wearing my shirt ?
<2en> Magic camp .
<2en> How may I help you ?
<sp>
<en> Damon , Kai has me at the high school .
<en> I need your help .
<sp>
<2en> Whoa .
<2en> Elena ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Why is your nose bleeding ?
<sp>
<2en> I have a guess .
<2en> Magic 's hard .
<2en> Isn 't it , Jo ?
<sp>
<en> I 'm so sorry .
<sp>
<2en> Don 't sweat it .
<2en> I want him to see me while I kick his ass .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Jo 's not strong enough , Ric .
<sp>
<2en> She wouldn 't lie about it .
<sp>
<en> No , no , no , I don 't think she 's lying about it .
<en> He absorbed a spell the size of
<en> Mystic Falls , Ric .
<en> He changed the game .
<sp>
<2en> Look , we got Kai on ice .
<2en> We 'll just wait for his stolen magic to drain away and then she 'll beat him . - Well , she can 't . - Well , she has to .
<2en> She will .
<sp>
<en> Well , all right , then . Here 's to women who make crazy , screwed-up decisions and ... Loving them more for it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> He 's back , and so is his power .
<sp>
<2en> Even when I didn 't think he could deceive me anymore ...
<2en> He found a way .
<sp>
<en> Banishment was too good for that demon .
<en> We should have driven that dagger through his heart when we had the chance .
<sp>
<2en> Then your name would be written across it .
<sp>
<en> It 's a small price to pay to ensure the crocodile wouldn 't come back again .
<sp>
<2en> I know you 're angry , but we defeated him before and we 'll do it again .
<sp>
<en> Yeah , but the question is , how ?
<en> We don 't even know what he 's planning .
<sp>
<2en> First , we save August . Yeah . You do that .
<sp>
<en> I 'll find out the Dark One 's secret .
<sp>
<2en> How are you gonna do that ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> I had somewhere to go .
<en> Or should I say some time ?
<sp>
<2en> You followed Emma through the time portal .
<sp>
<en> That I did .
<en> And when I realized what Emma had planned for Marian , well , I knew I had to get in while the getting was good .
<en> So I bided my time watching Emma and her one-handed lover scurrying about trying to right their mistakes , and ... When I saw they planned on bringing Robin 's wife back ,
