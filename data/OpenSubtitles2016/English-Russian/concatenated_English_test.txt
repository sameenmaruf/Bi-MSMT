<sp>
<en> It 's better to go hungry than starve for beauty .
<sp>
<2en> Mmm , all the perfume of the gods .
<2en> I find this place delightful .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Now he can take what he came here for .
<en> He opens the case , lifts the key , the alarm bell sounds .
<en> Now , he only has a few seconds , so he conceals the key , runs to the door , opens it , gets out and then closes it .
<en> But he can 't go any further because already the security guards and officials are on their way .
<en> So he decides to pretend that he is first on the scene .
<sp>
<2en> - The relief guard .
<sp>
<en> - Yes , of course .
<en> That 's why the guard inside let him in in the first place .
<en> - He knew him , he even expected him .
<d>
<sp>

<2en> What was that ?
<2en> What was that ?

<2en> Appreciate it ?
<2en> Appreciate it ?
<2en> But you commit mass destruction and murder on a scale that 's almost inconceivable , and you ask me to appreciate it ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> No , I haven 't . - It 's on such a big scale .
<sp>
<2en> I doubt our mystery friend could manage anything that size on his own .
<sp>
<en> If he is on his own .
<sp>
<2en> Of course , when we picked him up he was talking about looking for some friend .
<sp>
<en> Well , maybe there 's more than one .
<en> We don 't even know how he got here .
<sp>
<2en> Or how long he 's been here .
<sp>
<en> Well , the only track of anything we picked up , apart from your own ship , was of whatever followed you down .
<sp>
<2en> I think it 's too much of a coincidence .
<2en> You know we assumed it was Rohm-Dutt 's ship that had landed .
<2en> We haven 't found it , though , have we ?
<sp>
<en> It could 've belonged to this fellow , I suppose .
<en> He 's been here with us , so he couldn 't have done much by himself .
<en> But if he 's got friends out there , well , we 're in trouble .
<sp>
<2en> - So what are they up to ?
<sp>
<en> - Obvious , isn 't it ?
<en> They 're trying to sabotage the plant .
<sp>
<2en> Well , any activity on the lake bed could disturb the methane source .
<sp>
<en> Of course .
<en> Now I don 't know where this fellow comes from , but he 's obviously got considerable scientific knowledge .
<sp>
<2en> Look at the way he knew all about this plant .
<sp>
<en> Unless , of course , he was very well-briefed .
<en> It could 've been an act .
<sp>
<2en> No , no , no .
<2en> Not when he was talking about inserting the plasmin catalyst .
<sp>
<en> That 's true .
<en> But whatever he is , I think that he 's helping the Swampies .
<en> - You say one of the boats is missing ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yeah .
<sp>
<en> Well , if he took a boat rather than a swamp glider , it means that he doesn 't want the noise of an engine .
<sp>
<2en> That also means he 's trying to cross the swamps on foot .
<sp>
<en> Why would he take that risk ?
<sp>
<2en> Because he 's a Swampie-lover !
<d>
<sp>
<en> Look , all I do is take a little from those who have too much and then I spread it around a bit .
<en> I help to keep the economy in balance .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , but if this piece of jethrik 's so valuable , why don 't you just sell it ?
<2en> And then you 'd have plenty to spread amongst those who need it .
<sp>
<en> - I don 't think it 's worth all that much .
<sp>
<2en> - Tell me something , Garron .
<2en> Why do you think the Graff was interested in buying this planet even before you conned him into believing there was a jethrik mine here ?
<sp>
<en> He 's crazy !
<en> You don 't know about the Graff ?
<sp>
<2en> I 'm asking you , Garron .
<sp>
<en> He was Emperor of Levithia once , and a bad one , a tyrant .
<en> Raised an expedition force to go off to the Frontier Wars , leaving his half-brother on the throne .
<en> When the wars was ended , his people refused to let him return .
<sp>
<2en> And now he 's got nowhere to go , is that it ?
<sp>
<en> Says he 's looking for a new world .
<sp>
<2en> - What ?
<2en> A new world .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - What was that ?
<sp>
<2en> - The Shrievenzale , I think .
<2en> A colony of the creatures lives down here .
<sp>
<en> You mean the same as that thing that guards the Relic Room ?
<sp>
<2en> That was a small one .
<sp>
<en> Look , Binro , I think we 'd better think about this .
<sp>
<2en> The fact that they can exist down here proves there must be another way up to the surface .
<2en> See , they hunt for smaller animals out on the tundra , and then return here to their lair to sleep .
<sp>
<en> That 's all very well , Binro , but can we tiptoe past them ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Space travel rots the muscles , Binro .
<sp>
<2en> Space travel !
<2en> How is it done , my friend ?
<2en> How do you fly between the stars ?
<sp>
<en> If we were to stay here the rest of our lives , Binro , I couldn 't begin to explain that one .
<sp>
<2en> I understand , there 's so much still to learn .
<sp>
<en> - Have they gone ?
<sp>
<2en> - No .
<sp>
<en> You nearly got us killed .
<sp>
<2en> If you call that being nearly killed , you haven 't lived yet .
<2en> Stay with me and you 'll get a lot nearer .
<2en> - In fact , you 're a lot nearer right now .
<sp>
<en> - You 've got an unconscious death wish .
<sp>
<2en> Don 't bicker !
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Into your hand , yes .
<en> Let 's go , shall we ?
<sp>
<2en> Soldier , I 'm gonna blow up these caves behind us .
<sp>
<en> What are you doing , alien ?
<en> - The Ice Gods ...
<sp>
<2en> - Silence !
<2en> These caves will not shelter your scum from my missiles .
<2en> Now , you made a prophesy , old woman , what was it ?
<sp>
<en> All but one doomed to die .
<d>
<sp>
<en> That 's it . - Okay .
<en> Like that .
<en> Good .
<en> - Ready ?
<sp>
<2en> - Go ahead .
<2en> Guard !
<2en> Guard !
<2en> Guard , quickly , the Prince !
<d>
<sp>
<en> Welcome .
<sp>
<2en> What is so urgent that I must leave my duties and hurry here like this ?
<sp>
<en> I 'm sorry , Archimandrite , but there is a ceremony you must perform .
<sp>
<2en> - Here ?
<2en> What ceremony ?
<sp>
<en> - A marriage .
<sp>
<2en> - Your own chaplain could have done that .
<sp>
<en> - Not this marriage .
<sp>
<2en> Why ?
<2en> Who is to be married and to whom ?
<sp>
<en> The King to the Princess Strella .
<sp>
<2en> The King ?
<2en> Here ?
<sp>
<en> He has placed himself under my protection , Your Eminence .
<en> Sadly , I have to tell you he is sick .
<en> In fact , he 's very near to death .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , dear , dear , dear .
<2en> He did not look well at the coronation .
<2en> Not himself at all .
<sp>
<en> - No .
<en> I did note that , Archimandrite .
<sp>
<2en> - But near to death , you say ?
<sp>
<en> Indeed he is .
<en> It would be as well if you stayed here .
<en> I fear he will be in need of the funeral rites very soon after the wedding .
<sp>
<2en> - Oh , how sad .
<d>
<sp>
<en> No , I would not disturb the work .
<en> Besides , I don 't think our professor would be very amused .
<en> - Are we ready ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes , Excellency .
<sp>
<en> Then , let us begin .
<sp>
<2en> - What are you talking about ?
<sp>
<en> - You 're tinkering with time .
<en> Always a bad idea unless you know what you 're doing .
<sp>
<2en> I know what I 'm doing .
<2en> I am the foremost authority on temporal theory in the whole world .
<sp>
<en> - The whole world ?
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<sp>
<en> Well , that 's a very small place when you consider the size of the universe .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Your idea for the helicopter took a bit longer to catch on , but as I say , these things take time .
<sp>
<2en> - You .
<sp>
<en> - Me ?
<sp>
<2en> Who are you ?
<2en> What are you doing here ?
<sp>
<en> Well , I just dropped by to see Leonardo , actually .
<en> Is he about ?
<sp>
<2en> - Nobody 's allowed to see Leonardo .
<sp>
<en> - Really ?
<sp>
<2en> He 's engaged on important work for Captain Tancredi .
<sp>
<en> Captain Tancredi ?
<sp>
<2en> - You know him ?
<sp>
<en> - No .
<sp>
<2en> He 'll want to question you .
<sp>
<en> Well , I 'll want to question him , so we can both have a little chat , can 't we ?
<sp>
<2en> He 'll be here instantly .
<sp>
<en> You .
<en> What are you doing here ?
<sp>
<2en> I think that is exactly the question I ought to be asking you , Doctor .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Yes , Florence , 1 6th century .
<en> That 's where I , we met him .
<sp>
<2en> Can anyone join in this conversation or do you need a certificate ?
<sp>
<en> - If he interrupts again , Hermann , kill him .
<sp>
<2en> - Sir .
<sp>
<en> Perhaps you 'd care to come downstairs and examine the equipment in more detail ?
<sp>
<2en> And if I refuse ?
<sp>
<en> Must we go into vulgar threats ?
<en> Let us just say that I shall destroy Paris , if that 'll help you make up your mind .
<sp>
<2en> And am I supposed to believe you can do that ?
<sp>
<en> Well , you won 't know until you 've seen the equipment , will you ?
<en> - Bring him .
<sp>
<2en> - Yes .
<sp>
<en> - Can he ?
<sp>
<2en> - What ?
<sp>
<en> Destroy Paris ?
<sp>
<2en> - What , with this lot ?
<sp>
<en> - Yeah .
<sp>
<2en> No trouble .
<2en> Blast the whole city through an unstabilised time field .
<sp>
<en> You don 't seriously believe all this time travel nonsense , do you ?
<sp>
<2en> Do you believe wood comes from trees ?
<sp>
<en> What do you mean ?
<sp>
<2en> It 's just a fact of life one 's brought up in .
<sp>
<en> You 're beginning to appreciate the truth of my words , then , are you ?
<sp>
<2en> - That you can destroy Paris ? Yes .
<sp>
<en> - Why all this talk of destruction ?
<en> - What are you doing with my work ?
<sp>
<2en> - Professor , I shall show you .
<2en> Would you care to examine the field generator ?
<2en> You will now see , my dear , how I deal with fools .
<d>
<sp>
<en> The spaceship sustained considerable damage .
<en> I was in the warp control cabin and when the explosion occurred I was flung into the time vortex and split into 12 different parts which lead , or have led , independent but connected lives in times in this planet 's history .
<en> Not a very satisfactory mode of existence .
<sp>
<2en> So you want to reunite yourself , yes ?
<sp>
<en> More than that .
<en> I want to go back to where my spaceship is .
<en> Was .
<en> And stop my original self from pressing the button .
<sp>
<2en> And you were hoping to do that with this lot ?
<sp>
<en> You underestimate the problems with which I was faced .
<en> My 12 various selves have been working throughout history to push forward this miserably primitive race .
<en> So that even this low level of technology could be available to me now .
<sp>
<2en> But this won 't work .
<2en> Put yourself in that bubble and you will either regress back to being a baby again or go forward to old age .
<sp>
<en> I had worked out a way but it would have taken rather too long .
<en> Now with your help , I shall be able to return with ease .
<en> Now , build me a field interface stabiliser .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You must tell me of all the victories the Daleks have won whilst I have slept , and all the defeats .
<en> I shall learn from your mistakes .
<en> The Daleks shall be made into perfect creatures .
<en> They will be invincible .
<en> The Daleks will rule the universe !
<sp>
<2en> Oh , yes , the Doctor knows more about the Daleks than anyone .
<sp>
<en> - He is an expert in robotics ?
<sp>
<2en> - An absolute genius .
<sp>
<en> You 'll be safer here .
<en> You will stay .
<sp>
<2en> But you 're dead .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Very mysterious .
<en> We 've got to get the ships separated .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , but how to get through to the power unit ?
<sp>
<en> Yes .
<en> You know , there might be a way we can do it , using my ship .
<sp>
<2en> - Your ship ? - Yes .
<2en> Yes , where is your ship by the way ?
<sp>
<en> Oh , around .
<sp>
<2en> Well , there you go again .
<2en> How do I know I can trust you ?
<sp>
<en> Yes . Or I you Captain .
<sp>
<2en> - That 's hardly the point .
<sp>
<en> - Yes , but who 's helping whom ?
<sp>
<2en> All right , what do you want me to do ?
<sp>
<en> Right , when I give the word I want Dymond to put his ship on full power .
<en> Trust me , Captain .
<sp>
<2en> Romana !
<2en> Are you all right ?
<sp>
<en> I don 't know .
<en> I think so .
<sp>
<2en> What happened ?
<sp>
<en> I must have fainted .
<sp>
<2en> Was it anything to do with the machine ?
<sp>
<en> Yes . I was watching the projection and then I ...
<en> It isn 't on any more .
<en> I just felt hot . I must have fainted .
<sp>
<2en> I asked you not to put that particular image on .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Get Tryst .
<sp>
<2en> How did you know we could get into the projection ?
<sp>
<en> Same way I know I can get into the TARDIS .
<en> Tryst doesn 't realise what he 's stumbled on with that ramshackle machine of his at least . I don 't think he does .
<sp>
<2en> Relative stumbled dimensional field ?
<sp>
<en> Yes .
<en> All this is recorded on laser crystal .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Yes , I thought you 'd say that .
<sp>
<2en> - I think we should move . - Yes .
<sp>
<en> Nothing lasts forever .
<sp>
<2en> The Doctor has been forced to use the Key to Time .
<2en> It is no longer in a place of safety .
<2en> You will lure the Doctor here and help me gain access to the TARDIS .
<2en> - You understand ?
<sp>
<en> - I understand .
<sp>
<2en> Go with her .
<sp>
<en> Come on , quickly .
<en> Remember , that time loop is stretching .
<sp>
<2en> Doctor , come on !
<2en> The time loop is stretching !
<d>
<sp>
<en> Let 's see where this crack leads , shall we ?
<sp>
<2en> It 's better than getting the boot .
<sp>
<en> The Doctor has eluded me , but he has made his last mistake .
<en> See , the door is open !
<en> The Key to Time is mine !
<en> Enough !
<sp>
<2en> He thinks we 're just going to stand by and let him walk away with everything we 've worked for .
<2en> Come on , let 's get out of here .
<sp>
<en> - In this place .
<sp>
<2en> - What ?
<sp>
<en> My destiny is here , in this place .
<en> Not on Atrios , not on Zeos .
<en> - Here .
<sp>
<2en> - Astra , listen .
<2en> You 're not under the Shadow 's influence any more .
<2en> Now , let 's get out of here before he comes back !
<sp>
<en> No , I must stay .
<en> I am the sixth princess of the sixth dynasty of the sixth royal house of Atrios .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , yes , but we must get out of here before the Shadow comes back .
<sp>
<en> This is the time of my becoming , my transcendence .
<sp>
<2en> - What are you talking about ?
<sp>
<en> - Metamorphosis .
<sp>
<2en> Yeah , here we are .
<2en> Right , now , there 's the T-junction .
<d>
<sp>
<en> But if we get K9 up there , we won 't need a pick and shovel , will we ?
<en> We can still give the Shadow a surprise .
<sp>
<2en> - Well , let 's normalise then , shall we ?
<sp>
<en> - No , no , Drax , no !
<en> - Small is lovely .
<sp>
<2en> - Big is better , though , innit ?
<sp>
<en> Now the moment I have waited for !
<en> Open the door .
<en> Light !
<en> Too much light !
<en> You , fetch me the Key . Hurry .
<en> When the Key is mine , I shall dispel the light and darkness and night shall reign !
<en> Ah .
<sp>
<2en> Destiny .
<2en> My destiny is near .
<sp>
<en> Astra , remember you 're the sixth princess of the sixth royal house of the sixth dynasty ...
<en> And we 're looking for the sixth segment of the Key to Time !
<en> Oh , you 're in greater danger even than we imagined .
<sp>
<2en> - Have you found it ?
<sp>
<en> - I think so , yes .
<sp>
<2en> What is it ?
<sp>
<en> A molecular anomaly buried in the genetic structure of the royal house of Atrios .
<en> Passed from one generation to the next , until , finally , Astra .
<sp>
<2en> What 's it mean ?
<sp>
<en> I imagine it means that her every living cell is part of this Key of Time .
<en> And that , to save us , Astra must be destroyed .
<en> You see ?
<sp>
<2en> Hey , where are you going ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> - I 'm staying here to look for Astra .
<sp>
<2en> - But what about the Shadow ?
<sp>
<en> - Astra !
<sp>
<2en> No , Romana , come on !
<2en> Set the coordinates for Zeos .
<sp>
<en> We 're murderers .
<en> First Astra and now Merak .
<sp>
<2en> Romana , it wasn 't our idea to use the royal house of Atrios as carriers , was it ?
<sp>
<en> No , but what happened to Astra was our fault .
<en> We 're just pawns here to do the Guardian 's dirty work .
<sp>
<2en> I don 't like it any more than you do , but it 's done .
<2en> Have you set those coordinates , yet ?
<sp>
<en> Is that all you can say ?
<en> She was a living being .
<en> And now what is she ?
<en> A component .
<en> And Merak thinks she 's still alive .
<en> No power should have that right , not even the Guardians .
<en> - We must do something !
<sp>
<2en> - Well , you could start by setting the coordinates for Zeos .
<sp>
<en> - Why ?
<sp>
<2en> - Romana , you get carried away .
<2en> If you don 't set those coordinates , millions of people will die and this time it really will be our fault .
<2en> Have you forgotten the time loop ?
<sp>
<en> No , I hadn 't forgotten the time loop .
<en> Can 't you put the new segment in ?
<sp>
<2en> In less than a second ?
<2en> Quick , cutters !
<2en> Cutters !
<sp>
<en> Here , what a mess in here !
<d>
<sp>
<en> - What ?
<sp>
<2en> - Seeing into the future ?
<sp>
<en> Oh , well ...
<sp>
<2en> Crystal ball man , are you ?
<2en> Or do you favour goat entrails ?
<sp>
<en> No , I tend to use a police box affair .
<sp>
<2en> - A police box affair . Yes .
<sp>
<en> - What about your prophecy ?
<en> Did it by any chance concern the Lady Adrasta ?
<sp>
<2en> - Oh , you 've met her ?
<sp>
<en> - Yes .
<sp>
<2en> A difficult woman .
<2en> Very literal mind .
<2en> I told her that she would have visitors from beyond the stars .
<sp>
<en> That was a bit rash , wasn 't it ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , it seemed a safe enough bet at the time .
<2en> It 's a great attention-getter , you know .
<2en> I do it very well .
<2en> I see a creature coming to you from beyond the stars .
<2en> I 've done it in all the courts on the planet .
<2en> It usually goes down very well .
<sp>
<en> Yes , I can see it might .
<en> But the Lady Adrasta ...
<sp>
<2en> Oh , she grew very nasty .
<2en> What sort of a creature , she wanted to know ?
<2en> Well , I stalled a bit , you know , a little professional ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> Wait a minute ...
<en> Let 's get out of here !
<sp>
<2en> The Empire is still out there !
<2en> I don 't think ...
<sp>
<en> No time to discuss this in committee !
<sp>
<2en> I 'm not a committee !
<2en> You can 't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field .
<sp>
<en> Sit down , sweetheart !
<en> We 're taking off !
<sp>
<2en> Look !
<sp>
<en> I see it . I see it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Noisy brute .
<en> Why don 't we just go into light speed ?
<en> We can 't ?
<en> How would you know ... the hyperdrive is deactivated ?
<en> The city 's central computer told you ?
<en> R2-D2 , you know better than to trust a strange computer .
<en> Pay attention to what you 're doing !
<sp>
<2en> Luke .
<sp>
<en> Father .
<sp>
<2en> Son , come with me .
<sp>
<en> Ben .
<en> Why didn 't you tell me ?
<sp>
<2en> Chewie !

<sp>
<2en> Luke , it is your destiny .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Why didn 't you tell me ?
<sp>
<2en> Alert all commands .
<2en> Ready for the tractor beam .
<sp>
<en> R2 , come back at once !
<en> You haven 't finished with me yet .
<en> You don 't know how to fix the hyperdrive .
<en> Chewbacca can do it .
<en> I 'm standing here in pieces ... and you 're having delusions of grandeur !
<en> You did it !
<sp>
<2en> Luke , we 're ready for takeoff .
<d>
<sp>
<en> She 's in some sort of trance .
<sp>
<2en> - She must have come from the grove .
<sp>
<en> - Yes , from the Melkur thing .
<en> You know , Tremas , your Source manipulator is really quite beautiful .
<sp>
<2en> Yes , its functions have expanded steadily over the years .
<sp>
<en> Its limitless organising capacity refined to a single frame and obedient to the will of your Keeper .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Come on .
<en> Off you go .
<sp>
<2en> - The signs are unmistakable , Katura .
<sp>

<en> Fosters , find Consul Kassia .

<sp>
<2en> Order of Proctor Neman .
<2en> We 're summoned to the Keeper .

<d>
<sp>
<en> Another zero .
<en> That 's a bad sign .
<en> Down , Tremas !

<2en> Did you key the whole number in ?

<2en> - Did you key the whole number in ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> I am now nearing the end of my twelfth regeneration .

<sp>
<2en> What 's in them ?
<sp>
<en> It is an ancient mixture soft , unborn grains ... ... flavored with rose petals .
<en> The rest is secret .
<sp>
<2en> Looking at the cake is like looking at the future .
<2en> Until you have tasted it , what do you really know ?
<2en> And then , of course , it 's too late .
<2en> Too late .
<sp>
<en> We have won battles against armies .
<en> And now one man defeats all my knights .
<d>
<sp>
<en> This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant .
<sp>
<2en> What about the height of the staff , though ?
<2en> Did Belloq get it off of here ?
<sp>
<en> Yes .
<en> It is here .
<en> This were the old way , this mean six kadam high .
<sp>
<2en> - About 72 inches . - Wait !
<d>
<sp>
<en> Forgive my curiosity as to how your craft came aboard .
<sp>
<2en> An error .
<2en> My assistant miscalculated the coordinates .
<sp>
<en> Too right , he did .
<sp>
<2en> Or it could have been your dense magnetic field causing a fluctuation of my artron energy .
<sp>
<en> What energy is that ?
<en> You possess an energy you do not understand ?
<sp>
<2en> Yes .
<2en> Silly , isn 't it ?
<2en> Only my professor at the academy seemed to understand it .
<2en> Just goes to show how academic everything is .
<d>
<sp>

<sp>
<en> Thank you .
<sp>
<2en> You are all Earthlings .
<2en> What are you doing on this ship ?

<d>
<sp>
<en> - It 's the only way to stop them .
<sp>
<2en> - Who ?
<sp>
<en> I don 't know , but I have the feeling that they want considerably more than control of this ship .
<sp>
<2en> - Personal guard fully activated .
<sp>
<en> - Excellent .
<sp>
<2en> The captain will see that his power lines have been tapped .
<sp>
<en> Why did you not jam their instruments ?
<sp>
<2en> Our demand on their electrical supply was too great .
<2en> - The ship 's computer was alerted .
<sp>
<en> - We will take the bridge at once .
<en> Continue the reactivation .
<d>
<sp>
<en> An amazing illusion .
<en> I must learn how it 's done .
<sp>
<2en> - What 's that smell ?
<sp>
<en> - Soliton gas .
<sp>
<2en> I thought I recognised it .
<sp>
<en> Who 'd want this sort of atmosphere ?
<en> It 's stifling .
<sp>
<2en> Someone who needs it to breathe properly .
<2en> Let 's find them .
<2en> I said let 's find them .
<sp>
<en> Should you find the wine cellar , sir . A bottle of Sacaby would be most appreciated .
<sp>
<2en> That 's stealing .

<sp>
<en> Look .
<sp>
<2en> So many of them .
<2en> Normally , they only associate in groups of three and four .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Go on .

<2en> I can 't . It hurts me .

<sp>
<2en> How do you mean , " exploited " ?
<sp>
<en> Well , like to get this job .
<en> I mean did you do , or were you asked to do anything that 's lewd or unsavory , or ... ... otherwise repulsive to your person ?
<sp>
<2en> Are you for real ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> There are no goodbyes for us , Charlie .
<en> Wherever you are , you will always be in my heart .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm going to clear the courtroom .
<sp>
<en> I 'm not sure we 'd be able to .
<en> It is a first hearing .
<en> It 's supposed to be public .
<en> And he 's a lawyer .
<sp>
<2en> I don 't know where they found the nerve .
<sp>
<en> I don 't either , but the troops won 't be here till tomorrow .
<sp>
<2en> How did the press get here before the military ?
<sp>
<en> That English clergyman sent a number of telegrams yesterday .
<en> I understand one of them even went to the viceroy .
<sp>
<2en> You have been ordered out of the province on the grounds of disturbing the peace .
<sp>
<en> With respect , I refuse to go . Do you want to go to jail ?
<en> As you wish .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Have I ever led you astray ?
<sp>
<2en> - There 's always a first time .
<2en> - Who owns this place ?
<sp>
<en> - The state .
<en> It 's a kind of forgotten national treasure .
<en> No one ever comes here except the odd gardener during the day .
<d>
<sp>
<en> She won 't go any further .
<en> She 's too frightened .
<sp>
<2en> Well , you 'll have to stay with her .
<2en> I 'll go into the cave alone .
<sp>
<en> I 'm afraid Dojjen came to believe so many things .
<en> He became very erratic towards the end .
<en> The real work here was sadly neglected .
<sp>
<2en> - The real work ?
<sp>
<en> - Yes , my lord .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , you mean poking about in the ruins and digging for trinkets .
<sp>
<en> Classified , my lord .
<en> I have tried to re-establish our studies here on a strictly scientific basis .
<sp>
<2en> And I 'm sure we 're all truly grateful .
<2en> Shall we proceed to the chamber of the Mara ?
<sp>
<en> Exquisite , isn 't it ? - What was in its mouth ?
<en> - The Great Crystal , my lord .
<en> Purely decorative .
<sp>
<2en> - Where is it now ?
<2en> Is it lost ?
<sp>
<en> - Oh , no , my lord .
<en> It was removed from its socket when the Mara was destroyed .
<en> Traditionally , its safekeeping is the responsibility of the Director .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You 're a fool , Maxil .
<sp>
<2en> In here .
<2en> Maxil has just planted a listening device in the console room .
<2en> Well now , we have proof my biodata extract was removed from the Matrix .
<sp>
<en> - So there is a traitor .
<sp>
<2en> - Indeed .
<2en> And a disaster in the making .
<2en> Unless I 'm mistaken , Gallifrey could lose control of the space-time Matrix .
<sp>
<en> But that 's impossible .
<sp>
<2en> That 's exactly what the High Council think .
<2en> So , we must see what we can do to stop it happening .
<d>
<sp>
<en> It 's working , sir .
<en> Omega is confused .
<sp>
<2en> We 're almost ready to materialise .
<sp>
<en> - Good .
<sp>
<2en> - What 's that for ?
<sp>
<en> Omega 's using a fusion booster to build up energy to transfer .
<en> If we can attach this , it should knock it out of phase .
<sp>
<2en> Isn 't that dangerous ?
<sp>
<en> Hopefully it will feed the power back through his own equipment .
<sp>
<2en> - A kind of short circuit . - Exactly !
<sp>
<en> How 's the meter ?
<sp>
<2en> Now calibrated to detect any change in antimatter .
<sp>
<en> Omega has destroyed the loop .
<sp>
<2en> Let 's hope it gave the Doctor all the time he needed .
<sp>
<en> I don 't believe it .
<sp>
<2en> - What ?
<sp>
<en> I think we made it .
<en> Come on .
<sp>
<2en> It sounds like a power house in there .
<sp>
<en> How do you know where to look ?
<sp>
<2en> When I spoke to Tegan , she mentioned her cousin and the JHC .
<sp>
<en> So ?
<sp>
<2en> She risked her life to give us that piece of information .
<2en> If we find out what the JHC is , it might lead us to where she is .
<sp>
<en> How will you find out ?
<sp>
<2en> We 'll start with the telephone directory .
<sp>
<en> You 're dealing with a Time Lord , Doctor .
<en> You won 't find answers in there .
<sp>
<2en> Won 't we ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> He could live for years .
<en> And so my son must wait .
<en> The young do not like to wait , do they ?
<en> As a rule .
<en> You may speak freely .
<en> Strictly between ourselves .
<en> Lon !
<en> Where have you been ?
<sp>
<2en> Nowhere , Mother .
<2en> Just exploring .
<2en> Ambril has been showing me around , haven 't you ?
<sp>
<en> - Patience .
<sp>
<2en> - How can you be so calm ?
<2en> - What if Chela doesn 't help ?
<sp>
<en> - I think he will .
<sp>
<2en> - You can 't be certain .
<sp>
<en> - No .
<sp>
<2en> And meanwhile , the Mara could destroy Tegan .
<sp>
<en> My fault , I 'm afraid . I did rather insist .
<en> And he 's got a little dusty in the process .
<en> Ambril has an announcement to make . - Do I ?
<en> - Yes , you do .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , yes . ( STAMMERING )
<d>
<sp>
<en> - What made you change your mind ?
<sp>
<2en> Are you sure ?
<2en> He seemed such a pleasant young man .
<sp>
<en> He 's taken the key .
<en> That proves he 's involved .
<sp>
<2en> You must get out of the building at once .
<sp>
<en> - And back to the Tardis ?
<sp>
<2en> - You 're forgetting Tegan .
<sp>
<en> I want all the entrances sealed .
<en> They must not escape .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Well , on the day of the ceremony , the attendant demons seek out the unwary .
<en> Anyone they touch with evil must pay up or ...
<sp>
<2en> - Or what ?
<sp>
<en> - Have water tipped over their heads .
<en> It 's part of the fun .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm afraid I don 't have a coin .
<sp>
<en> Here you are . May you never feel the serpent 's tooth .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Lord Vader , this is an unexpected pleasure .
<en> We 're honoured .

<2en> I 'm here to put you back on schedule .
<sp>
<en> I assure you , Lord Vader , my men are working as fast as they can .
<sp>
<2en> Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them .
<sp>
<en> I tell you this station will be operational as planned .
<sp>
<2en> The emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
<sp>
<en> But he asks the impossible .
<en> I need more men .
<sp>
<2en> Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives .
<sp>
<en> - The emperor 's coming here ?
<sp>
<2en> - That is correct , Commander ... and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .
<sp>
<en> We shall double our efforts .
<sp>
<2en> I hope so , Commander , for your sake .
<2en> The emperor is not as forgiving as I am .
<sp>
<en> Of course I 'm worried .
<en> And you should be too .
<en> Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place .
<en> Don 't be so sure .
<en> If I told you half the things I 've heard about this Jabba the Hutt ... you 'd probably short-circuit .
<en> R2 , are you sure this is the right place ?
<en> I 'd better knock , I suppose .
<en> There doesn 't seem to be anyone here .
<en> Let 's go back and tell Master Luke .
<en> Goodness gracious me !

<2en> Absolutely nothing , Tegan .
<2en> There are still two power blocs , fingers poised to annihilate each other .
<2en> Hexachromite .
<sp>
<en> What do they use that for ?
<sp>
<2en> Hexachromite gas .
<2en> It 's part of a sealing compound for undersea structures .
<2en> It 's lethal to marine and reptile life .
<2en> I thought they would have banned it by now .
<sp>

<2en> No .

<d>
<sp>
<en> - Oh , thank you , sir .
<en> I come here personally to kind of smooth over ... any fracas about a certain matter .
<en> See , uh , maybe you didn 't know it ... but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town .
<en> He 's got lots of friends .
<en> Nice family and their money go back many , many years .
<en> Now friends vote . Family and money votes .
<en> That 's important to me and you .
<en> And if you 'll think about our little problem along them lines- - and you 'll forgive me for sayin ' it- - maybe he did not deserve to be fired .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm sorry , but he knew about our getting hit ... on three big machines in a row , and he did nothing about it .
<2en> That means , either he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was goin ' on .
<2en> Either way , I cannot have a man like that working here .
<sp>
<en> Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don ... we better be sure we can prove them charges .
<sp>
<2en> Believe me , if I could prove it , he would be under arrest .
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> I think you 're way out of line talking to me like that .

<2en> He 's incompetent .
<2en> He jeopardizes the whole place .
<2en> There 's not much more I can do for him . You have got me there .
<sp>
<en> Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar .
<en> But he is my brother-in-law ... and I would look on it as a personal favor ... if you 'd think some more on hiring ' him back .
<sp>
<2en> I can 't do that .
<2en> I appreciate the fact that he 's your brother-in-law ... and I do want to help you and I like to do favors .
<2en> I know who you are , but I cannot do that .
<sp>
<en> Well , could there be any position ... farther down the trough ?
<sp>
<2en> I can 't do anything .
<2en> He 's too incompetent , and the bottom line is , he cannot be trusted .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Walk away ?
<en> Andy , you can 't be serious .
<en> How can I walk away ?
<en> Don 't you see what 's at stake ?
<sp>
<2en> The old man said maybe your friend should give in .
<2en> When the old man says " maybe , " that 's like a papal bull .
<2en> Not only should you quit , you should run .
<sp>
<en> Every time they mention my name in the papers , they mention Nicky too .
<en> How the fuck does that help ?
<en> The heat he brought down is murder .

<sp>
<2en> He 's out of control .
<2en> I mean , not that he was Joe Restraint in the old days .
<sp>
<en> So what are our options ?
<sp>
<2en> Well , I figure either I refuse to do the spell and he kills us , or I do the spell and he kills us .
<sp>
<en> Give me a third option .
<sp>
<2en> He 's so drunk he forgets about us and we starve to death .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Do you have any idea what I do to a man who uses that spell to summon me ?

<sp>
<2en> Into women 's dreams and killing them ?
<2en> Now who 's dreaming ?
<sp>
<en> Not just any women .

<d>
<sp>
<en> I think you know .

<2en> - Well , I 'd like to meet her sometime .
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> - Oh , that 's what she was hiding .
<sp>
<en> - Hiding ?
<sp>
<2en> In the closet .
<2en> She wouldn 't let me go anywhere near it .
<2en> You 're lucky she didn 't sacrifice the poor thing .
<sp>
<en> I 'm sorry ?
<sp>
<2en> She 's a strange kid .
<2en> Very troubled .
<2en> Into all sorts of weird stuff .
<2en> Black magic , voodoo , God knows what else .
<2en> No wonder she doesn 't have any friends .
<sp>
<en> What makes you think she 's into black magic ?
<sp>
<2en> You should see her room .
<2en> It seems like every time I walk past , she 's in there chanting or something .
<2en> Sometimes , I swear , I even hear other voices .
<2en> I know she 's not happy there .
<2en> I 'm only taking care of her until her mom gets out of rehab .
<sp>
<en> Do you mind if I stop by your place and pick up some things for Aviva ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<sp>
<en> Great .
<en> Thanks .
<d>

<en> Well , you have to .
<en> The wedding won 't be legal without it .
<sp>
<2en> We 're going to city hall tomorrow , before the rehearsal dinner .
<sp>
<en> - But why not go today ?
<sp>
<2en> - Mom , relax , will you ?
<2en> Why are you so bent about this ?
<sp>
<en> Who 's that ?
<sp>
<2en> Oh , no .
<sp>
<en> Who is it ?
<sp>
<2en> Someone I haven 't seen for a long time .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - You love him , don 't you ?
<sp>
<2en> With all my heart .
<sp>
<en> - Okay , well , if that 's true , then ...
<sp>
<2en> - I 've gotta go .
<sp>
<en> This is so sad .
<en> We have to do something .
<sp>
<2en> - Yeah , but what ?
<sp>
<en> - I don 't know .
<en> We 're good witches .
<en> It 's our job , right ?
<sp>
<2en> I wouldn 't be worrying about Allison 's problem just yet .
<sp>
<en> What the ... ?
<sp>
<2en> How many times do I have to go through this ?
<sp>
<en> Until I 'm sure I understand you .

<sp>
<2en> Yes , with that big knife .
<2en> He was saying the most horrific things . Crazy things .
<2en> He lunged at me .
<2en> I screamed and I ducked .
<2en> And the next thing I knew , he was dead .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Then he tried to kill Jade .
<sp>
<2en> - Yeah , she 's a demon .
<2en> She comes to Earth every 200 years .
<2en> She has to find an innocent , put him under her spell and marry him in a sanctified wedding .
<sp>
<en> That doesn 't sound any different than most of the single women in this city .
<sp>
<2en> Well , she needs Elliot to impregnate her .
<2en> That way , her child would look normal on the outside .
<2en> But internally and mentally , her child would be pure demon .
<sp>
<en> This is huge , a child born into the wealth and power of the Spencer family ?
<sp>
<2en> And I don 't think it 's a coincidence that you 're catering the wedding .
<2en> I think it 's one of those things that we can kind of look forward to as protectors of the innocent .
<sp>
<en> Well , before we ruin the wedding , and my career , let 's make sure we 're right about Jade .
<sp>
<2en> This should make his assets rise .
<sp>

<sp>
<en> Emily 's cousin kicked me out .

<sp>
<en> Didn 't you sign a lease ?
<sp>
<2en> Who needs a lease when it 's " family " ?
<sp>
<en> You can stay with us .
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> Except that he did .
<2en> Rickman 's known for getting past people 's defenses but that 's just good business . Unless you think there 's more to it than that .

<sp>
<2en> Is this guy really a doctor ?
<sp>
<en> He was .
<en> Now he 's more of an on-call specialist .
<en> You know , actors , rock stars , billionaires ' sons .

<sp>
<2en> - He 's not .
<2en> We were the bait .
<2en> We flew to South Australia , got up-close and personal with a couple of great whites .

<2en> When you 're rich and untouchable like he is , you do things to make yourself feel alive .
<sp>
<en> Why 'd you go ?
<sp>
<2en> Because he didn 't think I would .
<2en> We never went on another father-son trip .
<sp>

<2en> Enough !
<2en> This behavior will stop this instant .
<2en> It is disgraceful , especially from the political leaders of this campus .
<2en> Now , I 'd like to know what is actually driving this recent rash of infighting .
<2en> Oh , goody , I get to guess .
<2en> Let 's see , perhaps you 're arguing over the same boy ?
<sp>
<en> Sure , we 're girls , so we could only be arguing about a boy , right ?

<sp>
<2en> Clark is not here .
<2en> And he 's not coming back until you people are gone .
<2en> So why don 't you just leave my family alone .
<sp>
<en> - Come on , Clark .
<en> They 're long gone . - Thanks for doing all this , Pete .
<en> You know I 'm always up for a little Undercover Brother .
<en> So we 'll camp out tonight , check in with your parents in the morning .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Dad .
<sp>
<2en> - Lucas . I heard about last night .
<2en> Well , you know , you wouldn 't be a Luthor if somebody wasn 't trying to kill you .
<2en> It didn 't hurt that Clark Kent was there .
<sp>
<en> I don 't know how he reacted so quickly .
<sp>
<2en> Well , Clark is a very special young man .
<2en> Did you recognize the shooter ?
<sp>
<en> His name 's Dirk . I did some business with him back in Edge City .
<sp>
<2en> Interesting euphemism .
<sp>
<en> You don 't sound too surprised .
<sp>
<2en> Where do you think you are , Walton Mountain ?
<2en> Come on , Lucas , think a minute . You walk in here , you take everything that belongs to Lex .
<2en> You think he 's just gonna give up without a fight ?
<sp>
<en> You know , that 's funny because Lex said that you wanted me out of the picture .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You could have hurt someone , most likely yourself .
<sp>
<2en> Yeah , that 's a rush .
<sp>
<en> Chloe told me what happened .
<en> Sorry I wasn 't there to back you up .
<sp>
<2en> Hey , you 're never more alive than the moment before you die .
<2en> At least Travis had that .
<sp>
<en> - Hey , you feeling okay ?
<sp>
<2en> - I feel great .
<sp>
<en> If you want to talk about what happened , I 'm here for you .
<sp>
<2en> Clark , all you ever do is talk .
<2en> For a guy who can 't get hurt , you never take any risk .
<sp>
<en> That 's not true .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Chloe , what 's going on ?
<en> Are you okay ? Oh , Clark , don 't tell me you 're jealous .
<sp>
<2en> Thought you only had eyes for Lana .
<2en> Oh , I heard about your date but , of course , it 's not like you have the guts to tell me .
<sp>
<en> Is that what this is about ? Don 't flatter yourself , Clark .
<sp>
<2en> I just wanted to explore my options , take a risk .
<2en> So , what can I do for you ?
<sp>
<en> Remember you said there was this weird hole in the back of Travis ' neck ?
<en> I was wondering if it could be from some kind of parasite .
<sp>
<2en> What orifice did you pull that one from ?
<sp>
<en> - That 's kind of harsh , isn 't it ?
<sp>
<2en> - Come on , Clark . It 's not like you hit the mute button on your skepticism when I take a logic leap .
<sp>
<en> It 's just a hunch .
<en> Travis ' adrenal gland was abnormal .
<en> Maybe the parasite was feeding off his adrenaline , making him want more .
<sp>
<2en> Don 't you think they would have found the parasite during the autopsy ?
<sp>
<en> Not if it burrowed out of that hole after he died .
<sp>
<2en> All right , so , what do you need me for ?
<sp>
<en> I can 't get within 50 feet of Pete .
<d>
<sp>
<en> One by one , the Katai fell at his hand .
<en> Nothing left to lose the last of the Katai lunged at the warrior with this sword ... ... the blade cut him clean in two .
<en> But when the warrior 's armor fell away the Katai saw he wasn 't even human .
<en> Just like you , Clark .
<en> See , I 've always been honest with you .
<en> But it turns out you 've been lying to me from the first day I laid eyes on you .
<sp>
<2en> - No , Lex , I can explain .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Mr. Quinn , begin drilling operations as soon as you can .
<en> l 'm on it .
<en> OK , guys , let 's move out .
<sp>
<2en> - What are these ?
<sp>
<en> - Whale bones .
<en> This station was abandoned in 1904 .
<sp>
<2en> Everyone just disappeared overnight .
<sp>
<en> It was a big mystery back then . One for National Geographic .
<sp>
<2en> - Lex . - No one goes anywhere alone .
<sp>
<en> There 's something there .
<en> Listen .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Listen , we had a good run .
<en> Four ?
<en> Five months ?
<en> I mean , that 's more than most people have in a lifetime !
<en> So , good-bye , take care , bye-bye then !
<sp>
<2en> Hey Ross .
<2en> What 's up , bro ?
<sp>
<en> What the hell are you doing ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> You 'll see a letter , from High Flyers .
<en> Read that ... then talk to me about fair .
<sp>
<2en> Rough night ?
<sp>
<en> Yeah , you could say that .
<sp>
<2en> Peyton , I 'm sorry for what I said to you earlier .
<2en> Everybody was laughing and ... I don 't know what came over me .
<sp>
<en> Don 't worry about it .
<sp>
<2en> No , I do worry about it !
<2en> We just started to be friends and ... I blow it !
<sp>
<en> It 's okay ...
<en> Anna , we all do stupid things .
<en> I 've ... done my fair share .
<d>
<sp>
<en> It happened .
<en> Now I have to move on .
<en> See ?
<en> I guess I 'm a little afraid of my future too .
<sp>
<2en> I convinced Foster to stop the procedure .
<2en> She 's on her way now to sign the cancellation papers .
<sp>
<en> And you think this is a good thing ?
<en> Clark , he knows your secret .
<sp>
<2en> I can 't let him turn Lex into a vegetable just for that .
<sp>
<en> - You can 't trust him .
<sp>
<2en> - And you 've never given him a chance .
<sp>
<en> And you give him too many .
<en> You think it 's easy keeping a lid on your secret ?
<en> I 've gotta think about it all the time .
<en> I gotta say " meteor rock , " not " Kryptonite , " and I gotta cover your unexplained exits .
<sp>
<2en> - Pete , I 'm sorry .
<2en> You 've never said anything .
<sp>
<en> - Clark , that 's not the point .
<en> The point is that I got your back but Lex won 't .
<sp>
<2en> Chloe , what 's wrong ?
<sp>
<en> Claire Foster 's dead .
<en> They found her car wrapped around a tree off Highway 54 .
<sp>
<2en> I feel the invisible hand of Lionel Luthor .
<2en> You two had better back off before he sets his sights on you .
<sp>
<en> I know you were just trying to help Lex , but you 've made matters worse .
<sp>
<2en> - There 's gotta be another way to stop it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> It is .
<sp>
<2en> Look , I know this sounds crazy , but I really think he has changed .
<2en> I could see it in his eyes .
<sp>
<en> Clark , as far as I 'm concerned , Lionel Luthor is never going to change , and neither is Lex .
<en> And we 're just going to have to accept that .
<sp>
<2en> I understand you helped vindicate me , Dad .
<2en> There 's just no telling the influence you seem to have from behind these bars .
<sp>
<en> I pointed your friend Clark in the right direction , that 's all I did .
<en> You still believe I had something to do with this , don 't you ?
<sp>
<2en> No .
<2en> I just assume you must want something in return .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I 'm not helping you get released .
<sp>
<2en> You don 't understand .
<2en> I know that I deserve to be here ... in this terrible place .
<2en> I have no one to blame but myself .
<sp>
<en> I 'm in a generous mood , Dad .
<en> So ... let 's say I believe that .
<en> What do you want from me ?
<sp>
<2en> I want to be your father ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Hi .
<en> Oh , I gotta get to the talon .
<en> Okay , um , I 'll see you two later .
<en> Bye .
<sp>
<2en> Bye .
<2en> So , clark , tell me , how 's football practice going ?
<sp>
<en> It 's actually not going so good .
<en> Some of the guys have been giving me a hard time since they found out I was starting .
<en> - Missing my passes ...
<sp>
<2en> - nobody said it was gonna be easy .
<sp>
<en> The frustrating part is , I could score every time .
<sp>
<2en> Clark , we talked about that whole thing , remember ?
<2en> The football field is not a place for you to be using your powers to save the day .
<sp>
<en> I just said it was frustrating .
<sp>
<2en> Look , son , if you 're gonna be the quarterback , then you have to be the leader .
<2en> Of course , a bunch of the guys are gonna want to challenge that , especially if they don 't think you deserve it .
<2en> Same thing happened to me .
<sp>
<en> I thought your team worshipped the groundyou walked on .
<sp>
<2en> Well , not when I was a sophomore , they didn 'T .
<2en> See , the coach made me starting quarterback .
<2en> A bunch of the seniors didn 't like that very much .
<sp>
<en> What did you do ?
<sp>
<2en> I earned their respect .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Clark , I 've been looking for you . They arrested Mrs. Taylor .
<sp>
<2en> I know .
<2en> It 's been all over the lnternet .
<sp>
<en> So long as you 're online , wanna ask Jeeves how long it takes to die of embarrassment ?
<sp>
<2en> Pete , how come you didn 't tell me how you felt about Chloe ?
<sp>
<en> It 's not like I ever had a chance with her .
<sp>
<2en> - What would make you say that ?
<sp>
<en> - Because I 'm always standing next to you .
<en> Oh , come on , Clark .
<en> As far as long shadows go , you 're the dark side of the moon .
<en> - Why are you looking through Chloe 's files ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> You 're lying .
<sp>
<2en> That 's a provocative accusation , Clark , especially coming from you .
<sp>
<en> I don 't believe you 're here just to check on Chloe 's health .
<en> Did you get her to work for you again ?
<en> Ask more questions about me ?
<sp>
<2en> Whatever I ask her to do , Clark , is in search of the truth .
<sp>
<en> She might die .
<en> You couldn 't care less .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I sent in my application last week .
<sp>
<2en> I don 't understand .
<sp>
<en> I 'm leaving .
<sp>
<2en> - Lana , if this is because of me- -
<sp>
<en> - No .
<en> No .
<en> Because of everything .
<en> I 'm beginning to feel like I need a fresh start .
<sp>
<2en> What about your life here ?
<2en> What about your friends ?
<sp>
<en> Well , maybe I 'll wind up in Smallville eventually , but I don 't think I can be happy , wondering if there 's something else out there .
<sp>
<2en> Why didn 't you tell me sooner ?
<sp>
<en> Because I didn 't want anyone to talk me out of it .
<en> And the truth is I knew you were the only person that could .
<sp>
<2en> Thank you for using KansCom .
<2en> Please enter your security code now .
<2en> You have one new message .
<sp>
<en> Hello , Miss Sullivan .
<en> It 's only me .
<en> Oh , no need to look for that conversation we had earlier .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Now , Pete might listen to me .
<sp>
<2en> - What 's that supposed to mean ?
<sp>
<en> - It 's called sibling rivalry . You and Pete are practically brothers .
<en> Now , from what I 've heard sometimes it 's difficult to take advice from your sibling .
<en> You were right about Jason Dante .
<en> He could be the poster boy for LoJack .
<en> All of the vin numbers you took down are for stolen cars .
<sp>
<2en> That 's all the evidence we need .
<2en> I 'm gonna go talk to the sheriff .
<sp>
<en> County sheriff !
<en> Hands where I can see them !
<en> Drop that drill .
<en> Good work , Mr. Kent .
<en> It only took eight deputies and four cruisers to discover that that barn was as clean as my grandma 's pantry .
<sp>
<2en> But I saw those license plates .
<sp>
<en> The only plates in that barn were the ones in the kitchenette sink .
<en> And none of the cars in there had vin numbers similar to the ones you gave me .
<sp>
<2en> - Sheriff , that 's impossible . - As usual , Mr. Kent your information 's about as accurate as the local weatherman .
<sp>
<en> But I 'm cutting you some slack this time because I 've had my eye on Jason Dante for a while now , and he is one slippery fish .
<en> Next time you say there 's a storm a-brewing , Mr. Kent I 'd better see some rain .
<sp>
<2en> Pete ?
<2en> What happened to you ?
<sp>
<en> Dante thought I was the one that called the sheriff .
<en> It was you .
<en> Dante knew about the raid , because he 's got a deputy in his pocket .
<en> That 's why he never gets busted .
<sp>
<2en> - Let 's get you inside and clean you up .
<sp>
<en> - Clark , I 'll be fine . I just need you to get me that $ 20,000 .
<sp>
<2en> How am I gonna come up with that much money ?
<sp>
<en> Go Kal on an ATM machine .
<en> - You 've done it before .
<sp>
<2en> - When I was on red kryptonite .
<sp>
<en> - Then go slip on a ring .
<en> Clark , you don 't get it .
<en> Dante 's a psycho .
<en> He told me he 's gonna kill my parents first and then if I still don 't pay up , he 's gonna come after me .
<sp>
<2en> Pete , you know I 'd never let anything happen to you or your family .
<2en> - But it doesn 't mean I need to break the law .
<sp>
<en> - That 's never bothered you before . We 've broken into so many buildings .
<sp>

<sp>
<en> - We need to split up . - We ?

<2en> I 'd be careful , Clark .

<2en> None of that sounds good .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You know the one ? It 's a crazy hunch , but I want you to take my bug and go and see if he was there .
<sp>
<2en> No , I could get somebody else to .

<en> Ruby , you were great out there .
<en> I still don 't know how you found him .

<sp>
<2en> A trial could be very messy .
<sp>
<en> A trial ?
<en> Who said anything about a trial ?
<en> Now once Ms. Blanchard has been incarcerated , you can plant one of your lovely skeleton keys in her cell .

<sp>
<2en> Give me one good reason why I should trust you .
<sp>
<en> Because I always honor my agreements .
<en> Do we have a deal ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> You know I don 't like it when you use magic .

<sp>
<en> Why can 't I just be myself ?

<2en> You heard the kid .
<2en> Operation cobra calls .
<sp>
<en> I didn 't think you believed any of that .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , I don 't , but sometimes it 's the only way to get through to Henry .
<sp>
<en> You know , a custody battle against Regina isn 't going to accomplish anything .
<en> ( Chuckles ) You need to look at the big picture .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I meant to be good .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm not here because of you , Pinocchio .
<2en> I 'm afraid I bring bad news .
<sp>
<en> Wait in your room , my boy .

<sp>
<2en> ( Jiminy ) H-hang on , Pinocchio .
<2en> I 'll come with you .
<sp>
<en> What is it ?
<sp>
<2en> The Evil Queen ... she 's threatened the entire kingdom with a curse , a curse that will rip away all that we love .
<sp>
<en> Then we must stop her .
<sp>
<2en> It 's too late for that .
<sp>
<en> So all is lost ?
<sp>
<2en> No . There is hope , if you will help us .
<sp>
<en> Me ?
<sp>
<2en> Snow White is about to give birth to a child ... a child who will save us all when she reaches her 28th year ... but only if she can be protected from the powerful effects of the dark curse .
<sp>
<en> But how can I protect this child ?
<sp>
<2en> There is an enchanted tree , much like the one you carved Pinocchio from .
<2en> If fashioned into a vessel , it can protect the child from the queen 's magic .
<2en> Will you do this ?
<sp>
<en> I cannot lose my boy .
<d>
<sp>
<en> When ?
<sp>
<2en> Right now .
<2en> You wanna come ?
<sp>
<en> I told my father I 'd take care of Emma .
<en> Can she come ?
<en> Please ?
<sp>
<2en> We can 't take care of baby .
<2en> You want to stay here for the rest of your life ?
<2en> Be my guest .
<d>
<sp>
<en> The deal ... it was all a trick to get you to eat that , to get rid of the savior .
<sp>
<2en> Henry , come on .
<2en> Why would she do that when I just told her I was gonna go ?
<sp>
<en> Because as long as you 're alive , you 're a threat to the curse .
<sp>
<2en> Henry , you 've gotta stop thinking like this .
<sp>
<en> But it 's the truth !
<en> And you leaving isn 't gonna change that .
<sp>
<2en> I 'll prove it to you .

<sp>
<2en> I 'm sorry it had to come to this .

<2en> But I believe in you .
<sp>
<en> See ?
<en> You wanna have some ice cream with that ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Walrus , get me home .
<sp>
<2en> Everybody loses the thing that made them .
<2en> It 's even how it 's supposed to be in nature .
<2en> The brave men stay and watch it happen .
<2en> They don 't run .
<2en> Come on !
<2en> I 'm going by my mom .
<sp>
<en> That 's a good place to go .
<sp>
<2en> Which way are we going ?
<sp>
<en> It don 't matter , baby .
<en> This boat will take you exactly where you need to be .
<en> It 's that kind of boat .
<en> Want a chicken biscuit ?
<en> They 're good for you .
<en> I 've been eating these all my life .
<en> I keep the wrappers in the boat because they remind me of who I was ... when I ate each one .
<en> The smell makes me feel cohesive .
<sp>
<2en> I want to be cohesive .
<sp>
<en> I 'm sure you will , baby .
<en> No doubt in my mind .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Where 'd the painting go ?

<2en> It 's right over there .
<sp>
<en> Why ?
<sp>
<2en> I have no idea .
<2en> That is weird .
<sp>
<en> - You hate it .
<sp>
<2en> - No .
<2en> No , no .
<2en> It 's just , it 's a little big .
<sp>
<en> - I feel like an idiot .
<sp>
<2en> - No , come on , you 're not an idiot .

<2en> Oh , Amy , come on ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> I 'm sorry , what ?

<2en> It was a long story .
<2en> Anyway , Sheldon , I promise I know what I 'm doing .
<2en> Please let me cut your hair .
<sp>
<en> Amy , what do you think ?
<sp>
<2en> There 's not a hair on my body I wouldn 't let this woman trim .
<sp>
<en> Fine , let 's go .
<en> Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Turn off our phones so our moms can 't call .
<sp>
<2en> It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbors called the cops on us .
<2en> They called the cops because of the smell .
<2en> They thought we were dead .
<sp>
<en> We were badass back in the day .
<sp>
<2en> All right , let 's do it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> That 'd be my boyfriend happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me .
<sp>
<2en> - Wars .
<sp>
<en> - What ?
<sp>
<2en> Star Wars .
<2en> They get all cranky when you mix the two up .
<sp>
<en> What 's the difference ?
<sp>
<2en> There 's absolutely no difference .
<sp>
<en> How do I get him to treat me better ?
<sp>
<2en> All right .
<2en> Let me give you a little girlfriend 101 .
<2en> Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex , but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty .
<2en> So , I 'd say ... give him the silent treatment .
<sp>
<en> No , he loves that . Hmm .
<en> Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours .
<en> He said it was a magical evening .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I got an idea .
<sp>
<2en> Does it involve breaking the law ?
<sp>
<en> By now , don 't you think that 's a given ?
<sp>
<2en> I was just trying to be optimistic .
<sp>
<en> Don 't bother .
<sp>
<2en> Stiles !
<2en> McCall !
<2en> I 'm gonna kill you !
<d>
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> Oh , yeah , no worries .
<sp>
<en> And maybe a few bucks for the valet .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , all right .
<sp>
<en> And gas money to get home .

<en> Regina , this is your chance to start over , to earn Henry .

<sp>
<en> Excuse me ?
<sp>
<2en> To my land .
<2en> Send me back to my brother .
<sp>
<en> Why don 't you check the " Missing " board like everyone else ?
<sp>
<2en> Your curse only brought the living .
<sp>
<en> Well , then I 'm sorry for your loss .

<sp>
<2en> Can 't be a gift . It was mine to start with .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Yes .
<en> But I have no idea how to get back there .
<en> I can see I just launched you on a heroic quest .
<en> Just also make sure you take care of my son .
<sp>
<2en> That I can do .
<sp>
<en> What do you need those for ?
<sp>
<2en> Don 't worry , brother .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - Well , how do you propose to do that ?
<en> Uh , I hope you 're not thinking about some sort of LSD thought-control .
<en> There 's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys . And that 's called school .
<sp>
<2en> Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up .
<2en> In your case , to your mother , superheroes , et cetera .
<2en> I 'm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me .
<sp>
<en> Well , seems what 's on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock .
<sp>
<2en> We 'll see .
<2en> Let 's start with a little romantic dinner music , shall we ?
<sp>
<en> - The " Super Mario Brothers " theme ?

<en> - All right , you sly bastard .
<en> When can you start ?
<sp>
<2en> - Okay , everyone .

<d>
<sp>
<en> No , thanks .
<en> I 'm fine .
<sp>
<2en> Now , are you sure ?
<2en> Everyone 's smoking them .
<2en> I think they 're the best .
<sp>
<en> I don 't do drugs .
<sp>
<2en> Excellent , yeah .
<2en> That was a ruse .
<2en> They 're not the best .
<2en> Physics is the best .
<2en> And by the way , coffee was also an unacceptable choice .
<2en> All right , so I see here you 're from Des Moines , Iowa .
<2en> Uh , you 're summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University .
<2en> Oh , and two years ago , you had a persistent ear infection .
<2en> I hope that didn 't cause any hearing loss .
<sp>
<en> No , of course not .
<en> How did you know about that ?
<sp>
<2en> I did a comprehensive background check .
<d>

<2en> So all we got to do is get Kevin close enough to memorize the spell .
<sp>
<en> What do you think , brainiac ? Think you can swing it ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Hey-hey-hey , what are you doing here ?
<sp>

<sp>
<2en> No , I know . It 's long overdue .
<2en> So , what ya doing ?
<2en> Better not be building a robot girlfriend .
<sp>
<en> Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette .
<sp>
<2en> You 're kidding .
<sp>
<en> Nope .
<en> Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring .
<sp>
<2en> Ooh ! What 's going on in here ?
<sp>
<en> Oh , no , no , no , don 't look in there .
<sp>
<2en> What , is it secret ?

<en> The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie .
<sp>
<2en> Ooh , Hallow-weenies !
<2en> That 's a good one .
<2en> They 'll pair nicely with my " Draculoni and Cheese . "
<2en> How do I do it ? !
<2en> That reminds me , I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I 'm just gonna wipe this off your face , okay ?

<sp>
<2en> Oh .

<en> What the hell happened ?
<sp>
<2en> There was a pastry mishap .
<sp>
<en> Okay , and ?
<sp>
<2en> And the frosting reached near-supersonic speeds .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I once looked in Sheldon 's underwear drawer .

<en> Amy .
<en> Why would you give me a word ?

<sp>
<en> We are here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific .
<sp>
<2en> Something I never forget .
<2en> I lost my whole family .
<sp>
<en> Get him some water .
<en> We don 't mean to push you .
<en> And you have our deepest sympathies .
<en> But we have come a long way ... and we are no closer to understanding why the ship sank .
<sp>
<2en> Because I don 't know .
<2en> I was asleep .
<2en> Something woke me up .
<2en> It could have been an explosion , I can 't be sure .
<2en> And then the ship sank .
<2en> What else do you want from me ?
<sp>
<en> A story that won 't make us look like fools .
<sp>
<2en> We need a simpler story for our report .
<2en> One our company can understand .
<2en> A story we can all believe .
<sp>
<en> So , a story without things you 've never seen before .
<sp>
<2en> That 's right .
<sp>
<en> Without surprises .
<en> Without animals or islands .
<sp>
<2en> Yes .
<2en> The truth .
<sp>
<en> So , what did you do ?
<sp>
<2en> I told them another story .
<sp>
<en> Four of us survived .
<en> The cook and the sailor were already aboard .
<en> The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard ... and Mother held on to some bananas and made it to the lifeboat .
<en> The cook was a disgusting man .
<en> He ate a rat .
<en> We had food enough for weeks , but he found the rat in the first few days ... and he killed it , dried it in the sun and ate it .
<en> He was such a brute , that man .
<en> But he was resourceful .
<en> It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish .
<en> We would have died in those first few days without him .
<en> The sailor was the same man who brought rice and gravy , the Buddhist .
<en> We didn 't understand much of what he said , only that he was suffering .
<en> He had broken his leg horribly in the fall .
<en> We tried to set it as best we could , but the leg became infected ... and the cook said that we had to do something or he 'd die .
<en> The cook said he 'd do it , but Mother and I had to hold the man down .
<en> And I believed him , we needed to do it . So ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> They told me you would be coming .
<sp>
<2en> Word is , you can find the Cube .
<sp>
<en> Is that the only word on me ?
<sp>
<2en> Only word I care about .
<sp>
<en> It must be strange for you , all of this .
<sp>
<2en> Well , this is actually kind of familiar .
<sp>
<en> Gentlemen , you might want to step inside in a minute .
<en> It 's going to get a little hard to breathe .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Didn 't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular-size feller .
<sp>
<2en> Thank you .
<sp>
<en> Are you an alien ?
<sp>
<2en> What ?
<sp>
<en> From outer space , an alien .
<sp>
<2en> No .
<sp>
<en> Well , then , son , you 've got a condition .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Don 't .
<en> Don 't do that to yourself , Clint .
<en> This is Loki .
<en> This is monsters and magic , and nothing we were ever trained for .
<sp>
<2en> Loki , did he get away ?
<sp>
<en> Yeah .
<en> I don 't suppose you know where .
<sp>
<2en> I didn 't need to know .
<2en> I didn 't ask .
<2en> He 's going to make his play soon , though .
<2en> Today .
<sp>
<en> We got to stop him .
<sp>
<2en> Yeah ?
<2en> Who 's " we " ?
<sp>
<en> I don 't know .
<en> Whoever 's left .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You forgot to look in the bathroom .
<en> A man like you missing the vital clue like that .
<sp>
<2en> What do you mean ?
<sp>
<en> My mother always said ... if you want to do a job ... do it right .
<en> Check the floor .
<en> Closer .
<en> Do you still think they 're just writing together ?
<en> What are you going to do about it ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> He appears to be doing some form of the Macarena .

<en> What did you do ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Hey , asshole !
<en> That was my line .
<en> I had that corner .
<sp>
<2en> You mean the one that you spun out of and finished facing the other way ?
<2en> I think that corner had you .
<sp>
<en> That move was total suicide .
<en> What if I hadn 't braked ?

<2en> That 's what I 'm here for ...
<2en> To help you .
<2en> Bonnie , listen to me .
<2en> You are the key to everything .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Wait .
<en> Find someone ?

<sp>
<2en> - Actually , I 've done it before .
<sp>
<en> - Great . I have to admit , after some of the things you 've said , I 'm surprised you 'd rally to his side like this .
<en> There 's a difference between running away from your father and watching him die in front of you .
<en> He might be a monster , but he 's my blood .
<sp>
<2en> What happens when he 's healed ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> You 're welcome .

<sp>
<en> No . I can 't part with him now , not when I know he 's The Dark One 's son .
<en> Can 't be chance that brought him here .

<sp>
<en> Okay , I think I have some really great choices .
<en> I went on Amy 's Facebook page and read up on her interests .
<sp>
<2en> Now , see , I never would have thought to do that .
<2en> Clearly , I made a good choice farming this out to you .
<2en> But I am telling you , Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot .
<2en> Anyway , my socks are on .
<2en> Let 's knock them off .
<sp>
<en> Well , um , I know she loves playing the harp , so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs .

<d>
<sp>
<en> Sheldon , you 're always saying how much smarter you are than me .
<en> Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science .
<sp>
<2en> All your ideas address the issue at a university level . By then it 's too late .
<2en> You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences .
<sp>
<en> That 's actually good .
<en> Why didn 't I think of that ?
<sp>
<2en> Some people are otters , some people are rocks .
<sp>
<en> I wonder if there 's a way we could give the idea a trial run .
<en> Maybe I could call my old middle school , see if we can talk to some of the female students .
<en> That 's great- - try to set up something for the three of us to go over there .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , hold on .
<2en> While I 'm comfortable speaking about science , I 'm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren .
<2en> Better Google it .
<2en> What exactly are you looking up ?
<2en> " How do I get 12-year-old girls excited . "
<d>
<sp>
<en> Oh , yeah , right .
<en> Wait , what was your problem again ?
<sp>
<2en> I am a man who can 't talk to women , trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can 't be around other people .
<sp>
<en> Yeah , that 's a toughie .
<sp>
<2en> Let 's think .
<sp>
<en> Hmm .

<d>
<sp>
<en> It was cute .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , don 't say cute .

<en> Get up .
<en> Let 's go . It 's good news .
<sp>
<2en> I 'm sorry .
<2en> I 've just waited for this moment my entire life .
<2en> I mean , I was interim manager once , but then I shot that gun .
<sp>
<en> What ?
<sp>
<2en> But this isn 't interim manager .
<2en> No .
<d>
<sp>
<en> - What 's going on ?

<2en> Get out of Jim 's seat .
<sp>
<en> Wha- - but I fought for this seat .
<sp>
<2en> You 're an annex kid .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Oh , gee , I don 't know .
<en> My schedule 's a little busy .
<sp>
<2en> Actually , I was thinking Leonard .
<sp>
<en> Oh .
<en> Thank you , Raj .
<en> I 'd be honored .
<en> What the hell ?
<en> I thought I was your best friend .
<sp>
<2en> You are , but you 've got kind of a big personality , with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger .
<sp>
<en> You know , maybe she 'd be more comfortable meeting a girl first .
<sp>
<2en> Good idea .
<2en> Bernadette ?
<sp>
<en> What the hell ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Kill him .
<en> The others can go .
<en> You 're beaten .
<en> Do it , Derek .
<en> Take the first step .
<sp>
<2en> Are we serious with this kid ?
<2en> Look at him .
<2en> He 's an Alpha ?
<2en> To what ?
<2en> A couple of useless teenagers ?
<sp>
<en> Some have more promise than others .
<sp>
<2en> Let him rise to the occasion then .
<2en> What 'll it be , Derek ?
<2en> Pack or family ?
<sp>
<en> Your eyes ... cover your eyes !
<sp>
<2en> - Someone needs to help them .
<sp>
<en> - Not us .
<en> I 'm getting the consulting business back up and running , and you need to graduate .
<en> That 's a normal life .
<en> And it 's what we agreed to .
<sp>
<2en> So we just ignore it ?
<sp>
<en> We stay out of it .
<sp>
<2en> There 's a pack of alphas trying to kill my friends .
<2en> How do I stay out of that ?
<sp>
<en> There 's a saying for these kinds of situations , the kind you have to navigate carefully .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I know a werewolf 's nature .
<en> I knew exactly what was coming ... a trap .
<en> I think it 's quite fitting that we are meeting in a distillery .
<en> You know , the process of distillation is the separating of two substances by pushing them into their different volatile states .
<sp>
<2en> Volatile is exactly the state I was hoping to avoid .
<sp>
<en> Then this is going to come as quite a big disappointment .
<sp>
<2en> What have you done ?
<sp>
<en> They attacked you ?
<sp>
<2en> It was an ambush .
<2en> One of the earliest weapons used by man was the spiked mace .
<2en> I 've made one of my own .
<2en> I 'd love to get your opinion on it .
<d>
<sp>
<en> If .
<sp>
<2en> What 's happening to her ?
<sp>
<en> He knew the answer , though .
<en> It didn 't matter that she was young and strong .
<en> Some people just aren 't made for this .
<en> But she fought .
<en> She struggled desperately , trying to survive .
<sp>
<2en> Don 't .
<2en> Don 't do this .
<2en> I had a vision , a vision of peace .
<sp>
<en> A little shortsighted ... wouldn 't you say ?
<sp>
<2en> I 'm sorry . I knew .
<2en> What do you mean ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> My mom Emma is the savior , not me .
<sp>
<2en> Yeah , she broke some curse , yeah .
<2en> Oh , I know more than you think .
<2en> But what if breaking the curse wasn 't the thing that made her the savior ?
<2en> What if having you was ?
<2en> Think about it .
<2en> You 're descended from the greatest of light and of dark .
<2en> What , you think it 's a coincidence that the spawn of The Dark One met your mother ?
<2en> You were created for a reason , and I can help you find it .
<sp>
<en> So you think I 'm supposed to save magic .
<d>
<sp>
<en> The what ?
<sp>
<2en> It 's the one time a year where they put their whole collection on display , and everyone dresses up as famous historical figures .
<2en> I got Stefan a costume .
<2en> Even he 's going .
<2en> Come on , Tyler .
<2en> I mean , how cute will we be as Bonnie and Clyde ?
<sp>
<en> Seriously ?
<sp>
<2en> You 're right .
<d>
<sp>
<en> No .
<sp>
<2en> I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom 's makeup and wears balloon boobies .
<sp>
<en> They weren 't boobies , they were muscles .
<en> And the makeup was green .
<en> I was pretending to be The Hulk .
<sp>
<2en> You were wearing her bra .
<sp>
<en> That was to keep my muscles from sagging !
<en> Can we please stop talking about this ? !
<sp>
<2en> Okay , okay .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Sheldon , what are you doing here so late ?
<sp>
<2en> I couldn 't sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us .
<2en> Also , I had one heck of a bus nap .
<2en> Oh , speaking of which , do you want some mutton and coconut milk ?
<sp>
<en> No .
<sp>
<2en> Well , I cannot give this stuff away .
<sp>
<en> What do you want ?
<sp>
<2en> Amy , this isn 't easy to say .
<2en> All relationships are difficult , but even more so when you 're in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions .
<2en> And frankly ... who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo .
<sp>
<en> Sheldon ... you 're not a weirdo .
<sp>
<2en> I wasn 't speaking about me .
<2en> I mean , honestly , there 's no telling what will set you off .
<2en> You know , introducing myself as your boyfriend .
<2en> Giving you the opportunity to drive me home .
<2en> Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humor , the funniest kind of humor .
<d>
<sp>
<en> What 's it say ?
<sp>
<2en> He 's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes , and wants to know if I 'd take a look at it .
<sp>
<en> That 's strange .
<en> That he would come to you for that and not me .
<en> Oh , I got two emails from him .
<en> " Do you have Leonard 's email address ? "
<d>
<sp>
<en> What about Felix ?
<en> He 's still free .
<sp>
<2en> - What are you doing ?
<sp>
<en> - They need to trust me .
<sp>
<2en> Henry 's right .
<2en> Can 't just let Felix walk away freely .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Did you bring that over with you ?
<sp>
<2en> Yes , Henry .
<2en> You know that .
<sp>
<en> With all your magic ?
<sp>
<2en> Why are you asking all these questions ?
<sp>
<en> Because I might need that stuff to protect myself from Pan .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , honey , he can 't hurt you .
<2en> He 's locked up in Gold 's shop .
<sp>
<en> But what if he gets out ?
<en> What if he finds a way to come after me ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> I am cleaning up .
<en> Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City .
<sp>
<2en> Come on , it 's your friend who 's coming to stay here .
<2en> Raj grew up in India .
<2en> Trust me , he 's seen worse .
<2en> Howie .
<2en> I promise I 'll help out the rest of the week .
<2en> The rest of the week ?
<2en> You said it was just gonna be a night or two .
<2en> Yeah , but if I told you a week , would you have said yes ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Okay , Sheldon , what do you want me to do , hide the information ?
<en> If I don 't publish it , it 's just a matter of time before someone else does .
<sp>
<2en> No , no , of course you have to publish .
<2en> That 's your responsibility as a scientist .
<2en> Doing otherwise would be unethical .
<2en> You have no choice .
<sp>
<en> Fine , I 'll publish .
<sp>
<2en> Can you believe this guy ?
<d>
<sp>
<en> Well , don 't look at me .
<en> I tried to send her away .
<en> Yes , Diego , what do you have for me ?
<sp>
<2en> Uh , we got a special delivery .
<sp>
<en> Would you care to elaborate ?
<sp>
<2en> Either our witch problems are over or they 're just getting started .
<sp>
<en> Marcel .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Sorry .
<en> I 've got a burdened brain tonight .
<sp>
<2en> No , no , no , no .
<2en> Tonight is not a night for burdens .
<2en> It 's to celebrate .
<2en> It 's to enjoy life for the few hours that we get to live it .
<2en> It 's to hug our friends , our family , and to dance our asses off .
<sp>
<en> I seriously doubt you invited us here to wait on us .
<en> You 're Hayley .
<en> I 'm Jackson .
<en> It 's nice to see you again .
<sp>
<2en> You 're the wolf who 's been watching me .
<d>
<sp>
<en> Time we got more persuasive .
<sp>
<2en> What is this ?
<2en> High School ?
<sp>
<en> Why don 't you take the hint and mind your own business ?
<sp>
<2en> This is my pack .

<sp>
<en> No need to get all riled up .
<en> It 's not good for you , Hayley .
<d>
<sp>
<en> No ! No ! Oh !
<sp>
<2en> I 'm sorry , Eve . Mmph mmph !
<sp>
<en> Everything is where you said it would be except that key you mentioned .
<en> That 's the one thing I couldn 't find .
<en> It 's the one you usually wear around your neck ?
<sp>
<2en> That key is a very important part of our family legacy .
<2en> You have to find it .
<sp>
<en> I will , I promise .
<sp>
<2en> I am so sorry .
<2en> I never wanted to involve you in this , in any of it .
<sp>
<en> This can 't be how it ends .
<sp>
<2en> It was the only way it was ever going to end .
<2en> I made peace with that a long time ago .
<2en> Listen .
<2en> I don 't know how bad this is gonna get , and I don 't want you to see it .
<2en> So in a moment , I 'm gonna let go , and you are gonna turn around , and you are gonna walk out of here without looking back ...
<2en> Ok , kiddo ?
<2en> Promise me , without looking back .
<sp>
<en> They are counting on our doubts .
<en> That 's right !
<en> Yeah !
<en> They are counting on our fears !
<en> That 's right !
<en> Right !
<sp>
<2en> You stayed .
<sp>
<en> Come morning , they will know that we are not cowards .
<sp>
<2en> What 's going on ?
<2en> What is he doing ?
<sp>
<en> We are not afraid !
<sp>
<2en> He 's making a move for power in the wake of tragedy .
<2en> He 's not alone .
<2en> There was another attack after you left .
<sp>
<en> What ?
<sp>
<2en> Your friend Jackson will need your help .
<2en> They will want vengeance ...
<d>
<sp>
<en> Anybody home ?
<sp>
<2en> Hey , what brings you guys here ?
<sp>
<en> Well , we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you 'd like to join .
<sp>
<2en> Why ?
<2en> Because Sheldon 's not here this week , and you don 't think I have any other options ?
<2en> I 'm just kidding .
<2en> I 'll get my purse .
<sp>
<en> Hi , Amy .
<d>
<sp>
<en> I 've read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals .
<sp>
<2en> Yeah , well , I don 't think we 're gonna get to do that today .
<sp>
<en> Too bad .
<en> It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze .
<sp>
<2en> Oh , hey .
<sp>
<en> And now we go to Reverse Warrior .
<sp>
<2en> How did she get you to do yoga ?
<sp>
<en> Well , to be honest , I thought she said " Yoda . "
<sp>
<2en> I 'm helping him relax because , unlike you , he supports me .
<sp>
<en> Oh , how many times do I have to say it ?
<en> I support you .
<sp>
<2en> Sheldon , take a break .
<d>
<sp>

<en> Your first duty is to try and save the sons of Ragnar .
<sp>
<2en> Surrender !
<sp>
<en> Rollo , go !
<d>
<sp>
<en> I suppose I was testing her , to see if she 'd actually try to poison Kenna before leaving the castle .
<en> And clearly , she tried .
<sp>
<2en> So , it was your poison .
<2en> Delivered at Diane 's hands and not yours .
<sp>
<en> Delivered to the wrong girl .
<en> You must believe me .
<en> Why would I tell you this otherwise ?
<en> What reason would I have to kill Aylee ?
<sp>
<2en> To make me believe Nostradamus 's prophecies .
<2en> He had a vision of one of my ladies dying .
<sp>
<en> He never told me .
<en> He takes no comfort in the horrors he sees .
<en> And he knows that I would probably have killed one of your ladies trying to convince you .
<en> I 'm telling you the truth .
<en> On my immortal soul .
<en> There 's still time to fix this .
<en> Leave for Scotland .
<en> I have connections ,

<sp>
<2en> Francis ?
<sp>
<en> Francis .
<sp>
<2en> Get up .
<sp>
<en> I can explain .
<sp>
<2en> Why did you steal Mary ? !
<sp>
<en> I was trying to help her .
<sp>
<2en> You took advantage of her fears , and this family 's trust .
<d>
<sp>
<en> You 're the control node , aren 't you ?

<sp>
<2en> Well ?
<sp>

<2en> My father , the great coven leader who treated me like crap for 22 years and then locked me here .
<2en> It 's like his ... like his kids didn 't even matter .
<2en> Coven always came first no matter what .
<sp>
<en> If Kai has access to an Ascendant and is sharing his prison with the Bennett witch , he will eventually find his way out .
<en> At least , this will keep him from merging .

<en> A high enough bridge , a tight enough noose .

<2en> Long ago , I did consider it , but Dahlia would never give me even that freedom .
