Each conversation starts with \<d\> (Subtitles) or \<chp\> (Europarl). Speaker boundaries are defined by \<sp\>.
  
The English side is annotated with the language ID where \<en\> means source is in English and <2en> means source is in Foreign language and has to be translated to English.  

Apart from being used for Bi-MSMT task, the corpora can also be used for Conversational MT in general where all source is in one language.

# IMPORTANT: 
If you use the OpenSubtitle corpus, please, add a link to http://www.opensubtitles.org/ to your website and to your reports and publications produced with the data! I got the data under this condition!
